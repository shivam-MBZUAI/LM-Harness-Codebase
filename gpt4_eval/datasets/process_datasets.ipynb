Option (b) 'Anachorism : Cubism' - These words are not synonyms. 'Anachorism' means something or someone that is not in its correct historical or chronological time, especially a thing or person that belongs to an earlier time.

Option (c) 'Accolade : Criticism' - These words are not synonyms. In fact, they are antonyms. 'Accolade' means an award or privilege granted as a special honor or as an acknowledgment of merit, while 'Criticism' means the expression of disapproval of someone or something based on perceived faults or mistakes.  Option (d) 'Absolve : Exonerate' - These words are synonyms. Both 'Absolve' and 'Exonerate' mean to free someone from blame, responsibility, obligation, or guilt.

The first step to solve this problem is to understand the common characteristic of most numbers. In this case, 10, 26, 24, and 18 are all even numbers. An even number is any integer that can be divided by 2 without a remainder. For instance, 10 divided by 2 equals 5, 26 divided by 2 equals 13, 24 divided by 2 equals 12, and 18 divided by 2 equals 9. All these operations result in whole numbers, meaning that the numbers are indeed even. The number 21, however, when divided by 2, gives 10.5, which is not a whole number. Therefore, 21 is the number that is different from the rest because it is an odd number, not an even number like the others. The answer is (d) 21.',\n",

To solve this, we need to understand the pattern or correspondence between the given sequences of letters and numerals.   First, let's examine the given sequence: 'A D A C B B D C c 1 3 1 2 4 2 a b c d'.   We can observe the following patterns:  1. 'A' corresponds to 'a'  2. 'B' corresponds to 'b'  3. 'C' corresponds to 'c'  4. 'D' corresponds to 'd'  5. '1' corresponds to 'A'  6. '2' corresponds to 'B'  7. '3' corresponds to 'C'  8. '4' corresponds to 'D'  Now, we are asked to find the letters/numerals that come in the vacant places marked by '?'. By following the same pattern, we can deduce the following:  1. 'a' corresponds to 'C' (since '1' corresponds to 'A' and 'a' corresponds to '1')  2. 'b' corresponds to 'A' (since '2' corresponds to 'B' and 'b' corresponds to '2')  3. 'c' corresponds to 'D' (since '3' corresponds to 'C' and 'c' corresponds to '3')  4. 'd' corresponds to 'B' (since '4' corresponds to 'D' and 'd' corresponds to '4')  So, the sequence '? ? ?' corresponds to 'd, c, a, a', which is option (d).\\nTherefore answer is (d) : Clearly, b corresponds to A 1 corresponds to C and a corresponds to 1. So, a corresponds to C. 2 corresponds to B and d corresponds to 2. So. d corresponds to B. So, the remaining letter ie., c corresponds to D. Thus. BDCC corresponds to d, c, a. a.\",\n",

The latitudes of D and C are same and the population of D is 20 lacs. Both the harbors are capitals and one of them is an industrial town.\\\\n\\\\nStep 5: From the given information, we can conclude that A which has the same longitude as E, cannot be a harbor and D having a population of 20 lacs cannot be an industrial town. So, E and D are harbors. E is an industrial town with a population of more than 50 lacs. Also, A having the same longitude as E, is a hill station.

E and D are capitals since they are harbors. A, having the same longitude as a harbor, is also a capital. The population of D is 20 lacs, so the population of A and B is less than 5 lacs. So, the two towns whose population is less than 5 lacs are A and B.\\nTherefore answer is (c): We analyze the given information as follows: Two are hill stations. Three are plains of which two are harbors. Four towns are capitals. Two towns are industrial. Two towns have population less than 5 lacs. One town has population 20 lacs. Two towns have population more than 50 lacs. Two towns are on same latitudes. B is a hill station. E is a harbor. Clearly, A which has the same longitude as E, cannot be a harbor and clearly, D having population 20 lacs cannot be an industrial town. So, it is a harbor. Thus, E and D are harbors. Clearly, one harbor is industrial town but D is not. So. E is an industrial town with population more than 50 lacs. Clearly, longitudes of a hill station and industrial town is same. So, A having same longitude as E, is a hill station. Latitudes of D and C are same and D is a harbor. So, C cannot be a hill station. So, B is the other hill station Thus, three plains are C, D, E. One industrial town is neither a hill station nor a harbor. So, C is an industrial town with population more than 50 lacs. Clearly, both harbors are capitals. So. E and D are capitals. The hill station A, having same longitude as a harbor, is also a capital. Population of D is 20 lacs. So, population of A and B is less than 5 lacs. Clearly, only one hill station is capital.

This means that if 18th February, 1997 was a Tuesday, then 18th February, 1998 would be the next day of the week, which is Wednesday. However, we need to find the day for 18th February, 1999. So we need to advance one more day from Wednesday. This brings us to Thursday. Therefore, 18th February, 1999 falls on a Thursday. It's also important to note that 1997 and 1998 are not leap years, so we don't have to account for the extra day in February. If they were, we would need to adjust our calculation.\\nTherefore answer is (c): 18th February, 1997 was Tuesday. So. 18th February. 1998 was Wednesday. 18th February. 1999 will be Thursday.\",\n",

Chromoplasts are responsible for the synthesis and storage of pigments that are yellow, orange, or red. The green pigment in plants is chlorophyll, not chromoplasts.

       " \"The question is a type of reasoning question where we have to evaluate the truth value of two statements: an assertion (A) and a reason (R) and determine the relationship between them. The assertion (A) is 'We prefer to wear white clothes in winter' and the reason (R) is 'White clothes are good reflectors of heat'. The first step is to evaluate the truth value of each statement.   Starting with (A), it is generally accepted that in winter, people prefer to wear dark clothes because they absorb more heat and thus help keep the body warm. Therefore, the assertion (A) is false.   Now, let's consider (R). The statement 'White clothes are good reflectors of heat' is scientifically accurate. White clothes reflect all wavelengths of light, including infrared radiation which we perceive as heat. Therefore, they help to keep the body cool by reflecting heat away, which is particularly useful in summer. So, the reason (R) is true.   Thus, the correct answer is (d) A is false but R is true. The assertion is incorrect because we usually prefer to wear dark clothes in winter as they absorb heat, while the reason is correct as white clothes reflect heat away.\\nTherefore answer is (d): We prefer to wear dark clothes in winter because they absorb the heat and keep the body warm. However, white clothes are good reflectors of heat and are worn in summer.\",\n",

Try to form a meaningful word with these letters. We can see that these letters form the word 'SURE'. 3. Now, we need to identify the third letter of the word 'SURE'. The third letter is 'R'. So, the answer is 'R'. If no meaningful word could be formed, we would choose 'X'. If multiple words could be formed, we would choose 'M'. In this case, only one meaningful word, 'SURE', can be formed. Therefore, the answer is 'R'.\\nTherefore answer is (b): The third, fifth, eighth and tenth letters of the word DISTRIBUTE are S, R.

In English, we read from left to right, but here we are asked for the third letter from the right, which means we count from the end of the word to the beginning.   4. Counting from right (from 'N' to 'R'), the third letter is 'A'.    Therefore, the third letter of the word 'RAIN' from the right end is 'A'.\\nTherefore answer is (a): The first, fourth, ninth and fourteenth letters of the word ADMINISTRATION are A. I.

We need to find the position of Mamta from the front of the queue.  Step 2: Calculate the number of people between Amrita and Mukul. This can be calculated by subtracting the position of Amrita and Mukul from the total number of people in the queue. So, the number of people between Amrita and Mukul = 50 - 10(Amrita's position) - 25(Mukul's position) = 15.  Step 3: Since Mamta is in the middle of these 15 people, her position will be half of this number from Amrita's position. So, Mamta's position from Amrita is 15/2 = 7.5. Since positions in the queue are in whole numbers, we round up to the nearest whole number which is 8.  Step 4: To find the position of Mamta from the front, we add her position relative to Amrita to Amrita's position. So, Mamta's position from the front = 10(Amrita's position) + 8(Mamta's position from Amrita) = 18.  Therefore, Mamta is 18th from the front of the queue.\\nTherefore answer is (c): Number of persons between Amrita and Mukul =50-(10+25)=15. Since Mamta lies in middle of these 15 persons, so Mamta's position is 8th from Amrita i.e. 18th from the front. \",\n",

By multiplying these two values together, we find that the total sale from product A is 8000 units * Rs 25/unit = Rs 200000. However, to know the total sale of the company, we would need to know if the company sells any other products. Statement II tells us that the company has no other product line. This means that the sale of product A is the total sale of the company. Therefore, the total sale of the company is Rs 200000. Both statements I and II are needed to answer the question, so the answer is (e): The data in both the statements together are needed.'\\nTherefore answer is (e): From I, total sale of product A = Rs.

This property is not related to the refractive index of the diamond, but rather to its hardness and structure. The reason given is that Diamond has a high refractive index. This is also true. A high refractive index means that light travels slower in the diamond than in air, causing the light to bend sharply. This property gives diamonds their characteristic sparkle. But this reason is not the correct explanation of why diamonds are used for cutting glass. The hardness and crystal structure of the diamond, not its refractive index, make it useful for cutting glass. So, both the assertion and reason are true, but the reason is not the correct explanation of the assertion.'\\nTherefore answer is (b): Diamond is very hard due to its rigid three-dimensional structure and so, it is used for cutting glass. Refractive index of diamond is high and gives it the greater transparency and brilliance.\",\n",
