From that, (D) must follow: A powerful nation seeking deterrence will want to let would-be aggressors know just how strong it really is; that knowledge is what makes deterrence work. It\u2019s unlikely that you pre-phrased (D); what\u2019s more likely is that after studying the stimulus, you proceeded to examine the five choices and (with luck) chose the right one.\n\nHere\u2019s why the others should have been bypassed:\n\n(A)\u2019s necessary condition\u2014the \u201ccertain knowledge\u201d of total destruction, signalled by \u201conly if\u201d\u2014is not something to which the author is committed. Deterrence simply requires enough awareness of an opponent\u2019s strength to make the potential aggressor think twice. (A) is too extreme to be a proper inference.\n\n(B) offers a case in which military deterrence would not be in effect, because the aggressor nation believes itself to be mightier than its potential target. This doesn't mean such a nation will definitely attack the other nation for this reason alone, but we certainly can't infer, as (B) does, that this country won't attack.\n\n(C) Oh yeah?

(C) as written\u2014implying that all peace is based only on fear of retaliation\u2014is deeply cynical at best, loony at worst.\n\n(E) makes a classic scope shift.

The author should have explicitly stated that there\u2019s a connection between the two; without such a stated connection, the argument falls flat. It seems like an obvious connection, but it\u2019s nonetheless necessary for the argument to work. By relating service and customer satisfaction to the success of the railroad business, choice (C) bridges this narrow gap in the argument.

(A) seems to lend support to the assertion in the first sentence, but why the railroads can\u2019t run both services at once successfully isn\u2019t discussed and isn\u2019t relevant to the argument as a whole, so (A) need not be assumed.\n\n(B) Prioritization isn\u2019t an issue. All the author does is posit a condition that\u2019s necessary if a railroad is to be a successful business.

Pared down, here\u2019s the strange situation: The amount of oil in U.S. proven oil reserves is the same as ten years ago, but oil consumption has increased. One possible explanation is ruled out\u2014no new oil fields have been discovered. So where\u2019s the extra oil coming from?

As for the seeming discrepancy at hand, no help.\n\n(D) Price? Like (C), (D) offers a possible explanation for a single element of the argument, in this case, the increased annual consumption of oil.

So the animals that have an easier time running uphill have relatively more surface area as compared to their body weight. How does this apply to the observation about squirrels? We know that squirrels weigh less than larger animals, and so they don\u2019t need as much energy to run up hills, but we can also infer that squirrels have less surface area than larger animals, and so they have less energy available to do the job.

(C) does just that: if the advertisers who left the publication would have increased their sales had they stayed, then they couldn\u2019t have left solely for financial considerations; something else must have played a role.

In support, the author notes that the suicide rates in October and November of 1929 were lower than the rates for the months before the crash. We need to weaken that argument, meaning that we are looking for a choice suggesting that suicide rates in those months were in fact unusually high. The whole key here is: high as compared to what? We know October and November were no big deal compared to the other months in 1929, but maybe a better comparison would be with the suicide rates in Octobers and Novembers of the surrounding years. This makes for a better comparison because it eliminates other seasonal factors that might come into play when analysing suicide rates throughout the year. Choice (C) picks up this distinction. When viewed in comparison with other October-November periods, 1929 does in fact seem like a high suicide period. Thus (C) weakens the argument.\n\n(A) is out of the scope.

The author seems to prefer disinterestedness for aesthetic political representation. Option 1 is wrong because it inaccurately states that \u201caesthetic political representation constitutes of disinterestedness\u201d. But the passage says that aesthetic political representation should be seen from the angle of disinterestedness.  3 is too short a summary and misses on the crucial word \u201caesthetic\u201d. 2 and 4 are very close choices, with only a slight difference. 2 says \u201cmanifested through indifference\u201d, while 4 says \u201cdrawing from indifference\u201d. Now what is the difference between the two? When X is manifested through y, it is y that dominates. God is manifested through human beings, means that God is hidden within the human being and the human being dominates the outward appearance. Whereas drawing from something means, aesthetic political representation should have a tinge of disinterestedness. There is little to choose between 2 and 4, but the right choice is 4 because disinterestedness is just an outward shade which must be cultivated, but not necessarily allowed to dominate.\n\nThe answer is option 4", "answerkey": "The answer is option 4", "origin": "cat_verbal_s4", "input": ""}
