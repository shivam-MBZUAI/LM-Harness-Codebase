{"question":"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A commercial airplane carrying 127 people crashed Friday in Islamabad just before it was to land at a nearby airport, according to Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, which cited poor weather as a possible factor. No survivors have been found, officials said. The Bhoja Air Boeing 737-200 had been making its first evening flight from Karachi to Islamabad, where the weather was cloudy, officials said. Authorities twice changed the number people reported to be on board, but by Friday afternoon appeared to agree on the figure. The crash occurred near the Chaklala airbase, a military site used by the country's air force, which is adjacent to the Benazir Bhutto International Airport in Islamabad. Debris and body parts were scattered across the crash site as workers sifted through the wreckage in the heavily populated residential area. Four villages were affected by the crash and debris from the plane has been recovered within a kilometer of the site, Interior Minister A Rehman Malik said in a interview with Pakistani media. At least 110 bodies have been recovered from the scene, while more than a 150 bags filled with body parts have been transported to hospitals across the region, according to Farkhand Iqbal, a municipal official in Islamabad. World's deadliest plane crashes . The flight data recorder, which is considered a key component in determining what may have caused the tragedy, was recovered, officials said. The Bhoja airliner had been flying from the southern seaport city of Karachi and crashed just before touching down in the capital after its 3\u00c2\u00bd-hour flight. Local authorities say the crash site is located about five aeronautical miles from the airport in Islamabad. Weather reports indicated that conditions in the area included thunderstorms and limited visibility, according to CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos. Authorities are examining what may have caused the crash and the potential for additional casualties at the site of the wreckage. Investigators are \"going to be looking at technology,\" aviation security consultant Greg Feith said. \"What kind of radio equipment, what kind of ground proximity warning system the aircraft was equipped with, weather radar, things like that ... since the weather may be a factor in this accident.\" Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani on Friday expressed \"deep shock and grief over the tragedy,\" ordering his country's Civil Aviation Authority \"to gear up all its resources for rescue operation,\" state media reported. A separate inquiry into the incident has been launched by Pakistan's Safety Investigation Board, and two crisis operation rooms have been set up at airports in both Islamabad and Karachi to provide information to the affected families. A Boeing spokeswoman, meanwhile, said the American manufacturer \"stands ready to provide technical assistance to the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan.\" The airliner was originally sold in 1985, said Julie O'Donnell. \"The Boeing Company wishes to extend its profound condolences to the families and friends of those lost today in the Bhoja Air accident in Pakistan, as well as wishes for the recovery of those injured,\" said O'Donnell. Responding to allegations that the aircraft was not in good condition to fly, Defense Secretary Nargis Sethi told a local television station that the government has initiated \"an immediate investigation.\" \"Whether it was 10, 8 years old, or not airworthy is something that we can't confirm yet,\" Sethi said. But Bhoja Air station manager Zahid Bangish told a Pakistani television station later Friday that the \"aircraft was new, not the old one and unairworthy.\" The crash is reminiscent of one in 2010,when 152 people were killed as a Pakistani passenger plane crashed on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. That plane was also was coming from Karachi when it crashed into a hillside while trying to land, officials said at the time. Four years earlier, another airliner crashed in central Pakistan, leaving 45 dead. The first known commercial passenger airplane crash occurred in Pakistan in 1953 when a Canadian Pacific DH-106 Comet crashed shortly after takeoff from Karachi. That crash killed 11 people on board.

{"question":"(CNN) -- In August 2008, Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan-American, and two friends from his high school in Queens flew from Newark, New Jersey, to Peshawar, Pakistan, where they hoped to join the Taliban. In Peshawar, the trio met with \"Ahmad,\" an al Qaeda operative who put them in touch with two al Qaeda leaders. Those leaders asked the three from Queens to participate in attacks against the United States. Zazi refused. He wanted to fight the U.S. military in the fields and mountains of his homeland, not to kill American civilians in the streets of his adopted country. So, according to American prosecutors, al Qaeda's leaders brought in someone more persuasive -- someone who could speak to Zazi in his own language, someone who had also grown up on the streets of New York City in the 1990s, a man who had had a meteoric rise in the ranks of al Qaeda over the past decade from camp dishwasher to the leader of the group's operations in the West. His name was Adnan Shukrijumah. Eventually Shukrijumah would be added to the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists\" list and a $5 million reward would be put on his head. And on Saturday, Shukrijumah was killed in Pakistan by the Pakistani military. Shukrijumah was born in Saudi Arabia in 1975, but his family moved to Trinidad in the '80s and then to Brooklyn in the early '90s. In 1995, Shukrijumah's family left New York for the Fort Lauderdale area in Florida, where he did odd jobs like selling used cars, earning money that he used to pay for his studies in chemistry and computer science at Broward Community College. Some Muslim men in Florida gave Shukrijumah books and videos about the holy wars in Kashmir and Afghanistan, and he was so moved by these stories of holy war that in late 1999 he traveled to Afghanistan to attend an al Qaeda training camp. Around this time, Shukrijumah told his mother that he was opposed to what he considered the excesses of the West, such as alcohol and drug abuse as well as the skimpy clothes that women wore in Florida. In May 2001, he left Florida again, and by June he was back in Afghanistan. Shortly after the 9\/11 attacks, Shukrijumah called his mother in Florida, saying, \"Did you hear what happened? They are putting it on the Muslims.\" His mother advised him not to come back to the States, and she said in 2010 he did not contact her again. It was Shukrijumah who, in late 2008, made the pitch to Zazi and his buddies from Queens -- Zarein Ahmedzay, another Afghan-American, and Adis Medujanin, a cab driver of Bosnian descent -- that they could help the cause of holy war best if, instead of fighting alongside the Taliban's tens of thousands of fighters, they went back to the States after their training by al Qaeda's bomb-makers and launched attacks there. At the time that Shukrijumah was making his pitch to the trio from Queens, the CIA drone war in the tribal regions of Pakistan was heating up. It was the last six months of President George W. Bush's second term, and the Bush administration had significantly amped up the drone program. Angered by the CIA drone program, Zazi agreed to return to the States to launch an attack. He also volunteered to be a suicide bomber, as did his two friends. They discussed with Shukrijumah potential targets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Times Square, as well as a Walmart store. Zazi returned to New York in mid-January 2009. He had been living on the Afghan-Pakistan border for five months, during which time he had been in almost continuous contact with members of al Qaeda. He was now ready to launch what al Qaeda's leadership hoped would be the most lethal terrorist attack in the States since 9\/11. Luckily, Zazi's plan to blow up bombs in the Manhattan subway around the time of the eighth anniversary of the 9\/11 attacks was detected by U.S. intelligence agencies that were monitoring the email account of a known al Qaeda operative in Pakistan who was in touch with Zazi. Zazi and his two friends were arrested before they could carry out the plot. It was Shukrijumah who oversaw this plot. After all, who better to oversee al Qaeda plots to attack the States than someone who had grown up in Brooklyn and Florida? A Pakistani army spokesman said on Twitter on Saturday that Shukrijumah was killed in South Waziristan along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. The fact that Shukrijumah is now dead makes the United States a little bit safer from al Qaeda's plotting. And the fact that Shukrijumah was killed in a Pakistani military operation is a sign that Pakistan continues to expand its operations against militants based on its border with Afghanistan in a meaningful way, which has long been a demand of the United States. Finally, Shukrijumah's death is indicative of how al Qaeda's core organization that launched the 9\/11 attacks continues to dwindle in size and capacity, because almost all of its leaders are now dead or captured. The elimination of almost all of al Qaeda's leaders in Pakistan suggests that the once-global organization may become just another Pakistani-based jihadi group with limited or no ability to operate outside of South Asia.","target":"Pakistan kills an American al Qaeda commander who was on FBI \"Most Wanted\" list .\nPeter Bergen says the death of Adnan G.

Shukrijumah had convinced Zazi and his friends to return to the US and launch attacks there. They planned to target the New York Stock Exchange, Times Square, and a Walmart store. However, their plot was detected by US intelligence agencies and they were arrested before they could carry it out. Shukrijumah's death is seen as a significant blow to al Qaeda's ability to carry out attacks on the US."}
{"question":"(CNN) -- On January 12, I went to basketball practice and then spent time with a kids' basketball league. The whole time my phone was in the car. When I finally looked at it, I had about 50 messages saying, \"Have you been watching the news about Haiti?\" It still haunts me to think that, as I went about my business that day, my homeland shuddered, crashed, and crumbled. More than 220,000 of my fellow Haitians died. Another 1.6 million were instantly left homeless -- most with nothing but the clothes on their backs. About 800,000 of them are children. Haiti has never been an easy place to be a kid. When I was growing up in Port-au-Prince, I felt lucky because I always had at least one meal a day. Some of my friends were starving. But we all shared what we had with each other. We figured out ways to have fun with nothing but a small patch of dirt to play in. We got along with very little, and we told ourselves that -- if we got just the slightest opportunity -- we would grab onto it and use it to do great things. That is what Haiti's children need now. They need opportunity. They need our help. It is amazing what kids can endure. Haiti's children have held the hands of parents as they lay crushed and dying beneath rubble. They've lost families, best friends, homes, schools. They can survive all that. But they can't thrive without us stepping up. Right after the earthquake, the immediate and enormous generosity from people in the U.S. made such a difference in Haiti -- and it made me very proud to be part of this huge-hearted nation. Organizations like UNICEF, which I have partnered with for years through my Samuel Dalembert Foundation, were able to provide emergency relief that stopped another wave of disaster in the form of disease and starvation. In the last six months, UNICEF has been providing water, food, shelter, immunizations, medicines, child protection, and education supplies to hundreds of thousands of Haitian children and their families. But in many ways, the hard work is just beginning. And the need remains huge. Those 1.6 million people left homeless are still living in tents and makeshift shelters -- and hurricane season is fast approaching. More than one third of the spontaneous settlements that have been created lack adequate sanitation, and this can make kids ill and lead to major disease outbreaks. People in settlements still rely on water being trucked in every day, and many don't get enough considering the near 100-degree heat. Learn more about helping Haiti at Impact Your World . Education is going to make all the difference to Haiti's future. Given the opportunity to learn, the children who survived the earthquake will grow up to transform their nation and lead it towards prosperity. But before the earthquake, only four in ten kids went to school, and that number is even lower now. Teachers are also absent because so many lost their homes and are now displaced. I was lucky enough to get the opportunity I dreamed of as a child in Haiti. And I started my foundation because I wanted to give other kids that chance, too. It's my deep belief that those who are lucky enough to have success in this life should do something -- anything -- to help others. So I ask: Even if you've already been generous, don't forget Haiti now that it's dropped from the news headlines. Organizations like UNICEF are there for kids, but they need funds to rebuild schools, train teachers, set up feeding centers, immunize against disease, dig wells, install water pumps... There are hundreds of thousands of very resilient kids in Haiti who are surviving despite all they've been through. They can endure a lot. Parents dying. Living in tents in 100-degree weather and rainstorms. Hungry bellies. But we don't want a nation of kids just barely surviving -- we want a nation of leaders. Haiti's children can't become leaders if they don't go to school. They can't become leaders if they're so hungry they can't concentrate. Or if they have to spend their days selling sodas in the street to make a few pennies. They can't become leaders if the water they drink makes them chronically sick. Or if they never get the vaccines that will keep deadly diseases away. If you join me in giving Haiti's kids the opportunities they deserve, I can promise they will do great things. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Samuel Dalembert.","target":"As Haiti recovers from January quake, children bear a heavy burden, says Samuel Dalembert .\nHe says it's important that kids not only survive, but are educated and kept healthy .\nDalembert recalls growing up poor in Haiti, sharing with friends who had less .\nHe and other kids vowed if they got any opportunity, they would use it to do great things, he says .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The author recounts the devastating earthquake in Haiti that left over 220,000 dead and 1.6 million homeless, including 800,000 children.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Gamers rejoiced over news that Blizzard Entertainment, the company behind popular role-playing game \"World of Warcraft,\" plans to release its first new franchise in 17 years. \"Overwatch\" is a team-based shooter game for computers set in a cartoonish version of the not-so-distant future in which a reformed band of heroes battles evil across the planet. Blizzard, which has built a global fanbase through its Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo franchises, debuted \"Overwatch\" Friday in a cinematic-style trailer at BlizzCon 2014, the company's fan convention, this weekend at California's Anaheim Convention Center. The trailer was followed by a gameplay demonstration showing characters such as an armed gorilla and a pistol-wielding Reaper showing off their abilities. A beta version of \"Overwatch\" will be available to the public in 2015, game director Jeff Kaplan told the crowd. The game marks Blizzard's first foray into the multiplayer shooter genre and its first new franchise in 17 years. It comes on the heels of \"Heartstone,\" a World of Warcraft-inspired card game, and \"Heroes of the Storm,\" which features characters from other Blizzard games. \"Perhaps the most amazing thing about Overwatch is the fact that it was kept a total secret, a rarity in this industry,\" Paul Tassi wrote for Forbes. \"Many were guessing that Blizzard's big surprise was going to be a new Hearthstone expansion or something along those lines.\" Immediate reaction to the announcement was mostly positive, though some wondered if Blizzard should just stick to its tried-and-true franchises.

{"question":"(CNN) -- When the Republican National Convention kicks off this week in Tampa, Florida, the nation will notice one thing before anything else: This is not your father's or grandfather's Republican Party. Rather, it's a party with leaders as diverse as the country it intends to represent. With the nation's changing demographics, Republicans can no longer rely on the South and Midwest to carry them to victory in 2012. Instead, they must broaden their base into traditionally purple and blue states. It's an uphill battle: President Obama leads by a sizeable margin with women and by wide margins with Latino and black voters. But it's not insurmountable. Romney already leads with men by roughly the same number President Obama leads with women. Nor is it unprecedented. Republicans won a landslide victory in the 2010 fall midterm elections. Now they must devise a strategy to repeat that. Republicans, in short, must repeat what they did in their landslide victory in the 2010 fall midterm elections. Opinion: Unfriendly to women? Not my GOP . Bolstered by the rise of the Tea Party, Republicans won back the House in historic fashion then. Independents went to Republicans by 15 points, an incredible 23-point swing from 2008. Republicans virtually eliminated the gender gap with women -- their best showing since 1982. Writing in The Wall Street Journal this week, Michael Barone notes, \"White noncollege voters and white evangelical Christians were only 42% and 37%, respectively, of the winning Republican coalition in the 2010 congressional elections.\" 2010 was a watershed year for Republicans because they were able to lure away much of the Democratic base, particularly Northern and Midwestern suburbanites and college graduates. They did so by campaigning on major policy issues and reforms, such as Obamacare and the national debt, that inspired and enthused the electorate. As the 2012 Republican convention dawns, look for Republicans to display a similar election strategy: a diverse cast of party leaders with bold policy ideas reaching for a diverse electorate. For one of the few times in GOP history, the top of the Republican ticket hails exclusively from the North, with Mitt Romney from Michigan and Paul Ryan from Wisconsin. The de facto leaders of the GOP bring a newfound party interest in these traditionally blue states. Already, Ryan has put Wisconsin in play for Republicans in some of the latest polls. In Michigan, which President Barack Obama won by more than 16 points in 2008, Romney trails Obama by only 2 points, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls in Michigan. The nation is familiar with the likes of Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor, but in Tampa, viewers will be introduced to a new, even deeper and more diverse cast. Scheduled to speak Tuesday night is Ted Cruz, Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas. The son of a Cuban immigrant, Cruz rose to attend Princeton University and Harvard Law, becoming a gifted orator. As the solicitor general of Texas, he argued and won high-profile cases in front of the Supreme Court. Also speaking on Tuesday night is Nikki Haley, the first female governor in South Carolina and the daughter of Sikh immigrants. She made her name as governor fighting the Obama administration's National Labor Relations Board lawsuit challenging Boeing's right to build a new plant in South Carolina. The NLRB dropped the suit after the union reached an agreement with Boeing. The plant could bring thousands of jobs to her state. Opinion: GOP -- big tent, or big mess? With the reshuffled convention schedule, also speaking Tuesday will be Mia Love, the mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, and candidate for the 4th Congressional District there. Love, the first black female mayor in Utah state history, is already making a name for herself with her outspoken, firebrand conservatism. Susana Martinez, the first female governor of New Mexico and the first female Hispanic governor in U.S. history, is set to take the stage Wednesday night. More important than diversity, however, is substance, and this year's crop of Republican leaders is a bolder, more conservative group than we've seen in decades. After paying a steep price at the polls in 2006 and 2008, the Republican Party might be in a new era in 2012, one ripe with intrepid, limited government and Constitutional reformers such as Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Chris Christie of New Jersey, Bob McDonnell of Virginia and Rep. Ryan, now the vice presidential nominee. The purpose of a convention, after all, is to coalesce individuals into parties and ideas into causes. With the selection of Ryan for vice president, the race takes on clear shape and focus -- repealing Obamacare, restoring fiscal sanity and jump-starting the economy -- that voters can rally for, rather than just rallying against President Barack Obama. For all the hand-wringing and second-guessing in the Republican primaries, the post-convention GOP will take on a new, united face. The goal, inevitably, is to replicate the results of the GOP's 2010 landslide victory. But to do that, it must replicate the same vision, clarity and diversity, not for diversity's sake, but for the sake of the wide swath of America's voters in need of help. Look for the GOP to harness, focus and refine that message all week in Tampa.

The party aims to replicate their landslide victory in the 2010 midterm elections, which was largely due to the rise of the Tea Party and their appeal to independents. The Republicans will focus on major policy issues and reforms, such as Obamacare and the national debt. The party's leaders, Mitt Romney from Michigan and Paul Ryan from Wisconsin, are expected to bring interest to these traditionally blue states. The convention will also introduce a diverse cast of party leaders, including Ted Cruz, Nikki Haley, Mia Love, and Susana Martinez.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Chelsea have closed the gap on leaders Manchester United at the top of the English Premier League after a John Terry header and a Frank Lampard double gave them a comfortable 3-1 win at Blackpool on Monday. Terry was left unmarked to nod home Lampard's 20th minute corner to put the defending champions on their way to a second victory in a week -- following last Tuesday's 2-1 home success over United. Blackpool were unlucky not to level before half-time when midfielder Jason Puncheon's fierce low drive was tipped onto the post by goalkeeper Petr Cech. But Lampard doubled the advantage just past the hour mark when he converted from the penalty spot after substitute Salomon Kalou was tripped in the area by defender Ian Evatt. And the England midfielder was on hand again four minutes later when he slid the ball home after Kalou's pass had split Blackpool's defence wide open. But Blackpool continued to battle away and they scored a late consolation goal when Puncheon found the corner of the net after being set-up by James Beattie. The result means Chelsea stay in fourth place, nine points behind United although they do have a game in hand. However, Blackpool remain in relegation trouble and they lie in 15th place, just two points and three positions above the relegation zone. Meanwhile, in Spain's Primera Liga, Deportivo La Coruna beat Real Sociedad 2-1 to improve their chance of avoiding relegation.

{"question":"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon said he is set to meet with Moammar Gadhafi on Wednesday in an attempt to persuade Libya's embattled ruler to step down. Weldon will also meet with Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Khaim, the Republican from Pennsylvania said in an interview with CNN affiliate WPIX-TV. Weldon said that in addition to Gadhafi's resignation, he is proposing a cease-fire on both sides; a withdrawal of government forces from key cities; no further advances by rebel forces; a joint interim government run by Libya's current prime minister and the an opposition leader; unfettered humanitarian access; and the establishment of a parliamentary commission that would include American, Middle Eastern, European and African politicians helping to establish a new parliament in Libya. As far as the Gadhafi family, Weldon's proposals also suggest a possible title for Gadhafi as honorary chairman of the African Union and allowing his second-oldest son, Saif, to stand in elections. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi was once thought of as a leading reformer in the Libyan government, but the 38-year-old has become one of his father's most outspoken defenders since the start of the unrest. In an opinion piece written for The New York Times, Weldon said, \"I've met (Moammar Gadhafi) enough times to know that it will be very hard to simply bomb him into submission.\" He said he was in Libya at the invitation of Gadhafi and that U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is aware of the trip. CNN did not immediately get a response late Tuesday night from the U.S. State Department or the White House about Weldon's trip. In 2004, Weldon led a congressional delegation to Tripoli and met privately with Gadhafi after the Libyan leader renounced terrorism in an effort to establish warmer ties with the West. Weldon said in his opinion piece Wednesday that he traveled in 2004 to support Gadhafi's decision to give up Libya's nuclear weapons program, though neither he nor the White House wanted to support Gadhafi himself. Weldon told CNN in 2004 that he had 14 meetings with \"everyone in the administration\" and toured a nuclear complex. Libya remains in a deadly stalemate as pro-Gadhafi forces battle rebel fighters demanding an end to Gadhafi's nearly 42-year-rule. Weldon's proposal also suggests free elections within 12 months overseen by the United Nations, according to reporter Larry Mendte of WPIX-TV who traveled with Weldon to Libya.

{"question":"Moscow (CNN) -- An American rock band, Bloodhound Gang, is in trouble with the Russian authorities over a stunt which saw one of its band members stuff the Russian flag into his pants and pull it out from his backside. The band member told the audience \"Don't tell Putin\" before whipping the flag between his legs -- beneath his trousers -- during a concert in Odessa, Ukraine, on Wednesday. He then tossed the flag into the crowd. The stunt, which was caught on video, was posted on YouTube and has gone viral in Russia and Ukraine. Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency named bass guitar player Jared Hasselhoff as the band member responsible. Now the band faces repercussions in Russia, where it has been barred from performing at the Kubana music festival, in a southern Russian territory, Krasnodar Krai, officials said. \"Talked to Krasnodar territory leadership.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Two decades ago, the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law, becoming a hallmark of American civil rights legislation. The act forbids discrimination against individuals with disabilities in a range of areas like employment, access to public facilities, transportation and telecommunications. Over the last 20 years, sidewalk ramps have been installed and accessibility to most public places has been improved. Yet, vehicles largely have been ignored. But that's about to change. Vehicle Production Group, a Miami, Florida-based company plans to start production of the MV-1, which stands for first mobility vehicle, at a plant in Mishawaka, Indiana, late this year. \"This is the first vehicle that's been built from the ground up for wheelchair accessibility and the only vehicle that's factory-produced that meets the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act,\" according to Dave Schembri, the CEO for Vehicle Production Group. Schembri said there are 54 million Americans who have some kind of of disability, with 4 million of them being wheelchair dependent. Those needing wheelchair accessibility typically have to convert a new or used vehicle, including the addition of a ramp, which Schembri says compromises vehicle's structural integrity. That, he said, negates the safety ratings of the vehicle and negates the factory warranty as it pertains to those modifications. \"Our vehicle, you drive up the ramp, and you turn right and immediately you're sitting in the prime seat of the vehicle which is shotgun next to the driver,\" Schembri said. During a test drive, Schembri said he took a friend of his, who is a member of the New York Knicks wheelchair basketball team, out to lunch. \"He's sitting there having a sandwich and his coke and he says 'I'm sitting in the front seat using a cup holder looking out the front window of this car. And I can't even remember the last time I did that,'\" Schembri said. Smaller than your typical passenger van converted to handle wheelchairs, the MV-1 will be rated as a car, standing about five-feet tall. The 36-inch door opening and access ramp complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act, while fitting nearly every size wheelchair. Schembri said he expects the MV-1 to start below $40,000, noting the company has received 4,000 reservations.","target":"The new vehicle is made for wheelchair-bound passengers .\nThe MV-1 is made \"from the ground up\" for people with disabilities .\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990 .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The Vehicle Production Group, a Miami-based company, plans to start production of the MV-1, the first vehicle built from scratch for wheelchair accessibility.

{"question":"Geneva, Switzerland (CNN) -- Iranian officials sat down Monday with the United States and other countries trying to put the brakes on Tehran's nuclear program, a day after Iran announced it is self-sufficient in the nuclear fuel cycle. There was \"an exchange of views and concerns,\" between the Iranians and envoys from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany, a diplomatic source familiar with the talks told CNN. The Iranian nuclear program was the main issue on the table, the source said. Iran has previously said it did not want the talks to focus on that. Iran also raised some of its concerns, the source said, including attacks on two Iranian scientists in Tehran last week that left one dead and one injured. The diplomatic source and a Western official later both told CNN that the talks had ended for the day and would resume Tuesday. The United States and other countries fear that Iran wants to develop nuclear weapons, an allegation Tehran has always denied. The meeting in Switzerland is between Iran on the one hand and the so-called P5 plus 1 group -- the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia and United Kingdom -- on the other. But bilateral talks also are going on, the diplomatic source said, refusing to say who was talking to whom. The source asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. The talks are going on behind closed doors and no public statements have been made so far. They'll continue Tuesday, the source said. And the P5 plus 1 nations are prepared to offer more talks if the Iranians agree to focus seriously on the nuclear issue. The group has been meeting intermittently, with the last round of talks coming over a year ago. Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, said Sunday the talks would try \"to underscore the concern of the entire international community in Iran's actions and intentions.\" Iran already faces stiff sanctions from the international community, because it has continued to enrich uranium. With the political barbs flying back and forth regularly, tensions were raised even further last Monday when bombers targeted two Iranian nuclear scientists. Iran blamed Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom's spy agencies for the attacks, which killed Majid Shahriari and injured Fereydoun Abbasi. But Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, told state-run Press TV on Sunday that the \"assassination of Iranian scientists will not hamper our progress.\" Salehi also said that Iran is now producing yellowcake, meaning its nuclear program is self-sufficient since it now produces everything needed to make nuclear fuel. He said the yellowcake came from the Gachin mine near Gander Abbas, on Iran's southern coast near the Strait of Hormuz. It's not clear that Iran actually has the technology to complete the entire nuclear fuel cycle, despite Sunday's announcement. But U.S. officials weren't surprised by the announcement, with Hammer saying, \"Iran has been trying to develop an indigenous program for years given that the import of yellowcake is banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions.\" He said the move raises further concerns about the Middle Eastern country's intentions, \"given that Iran's own supply of uranium is not enough for a peaceful nuclear energy program.\" CNN Senior International Correspondent Matthew Chance contributed to this report.","target":"NEW: Sources say the talks are over for the day and will resume Tuesday .\nU.S., British, Chinese, Russian, French, German and Iranian officials meet .\nThe discussions are the first on Iran's nuclear program since over a year ago .\nIran expresses concern about attacks on its nuclear scientists .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Iranian officials met with representatives from the United States and other countries to discuss Tehran's nuclear program, following Iran's announcement of self-sufficiency in the nuclear fuel cycle.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Students asked to fork out thousands of Kenyan shillings for a bursary; drivers pushed to pay police officers for traffic offences; people asked to shell out large sums to speed up the process of getting a new passport or making a land transfer. These are just some of the most common reports of bribery that can be found in ipaidabribe.or.ke, a recently-launched website dedicated to battling rampant public corruption in Kenya and uncovering its economic impact. The initiative, which was launched last December by Antony Ragui, a 37-year-old financial services consultant, allows victims of graft to share their bribe stories anonymously and track incidents of corruption online. \"I came back to the country from the States about four years ago and I would listen to a lot of Kenyans complain about corruption on social media, on Twitter, on private blogs and I basically got tired of it,\" says Ragui. \"I said now it's time for me to do something different.\" Read more: Crooked top officials should take a fall, says Kenyan corruption chief . Based on a similar site launched a few years ago in India to curb corruption, Ragui's online platform is divided in three categories, containing detailed information about the amount of money paid and the location of the bribe. The first section contains stories about bribes that were paid, breaking down the numbers by region and government department. The second collects stories from people who refused to pay a bribe, while the third contains stories of honesty, where citizens were not asked to pay a public official. Until now, Ragui's site has hosted nearly 600 cases of, mainly petty, bribery worth around 17 million Kenyan shillings (\u00c2\u00a3204,000). \"Corruption is a huge issue: it's so endemic and the worst part about it is it becomes a way of life,\" says Ragui, who's also about to roll out an SMS service that will allow citizens to report their stories instantaneously via their mobile phones. \"So what I'm trying to do with the site essentially is to get people to create a network of anti-corruption people -- people who feel that this has to come to an end and we need to make a difference.\" Opinion: Can Kenya avoid Africa's resource curse? According to anti-corruption group Transparency International, Kenya is one of the world's most corrupt countries. The group's 2011 East African Bribery Index said that there is a 67% chance that Kenyans would be expected to pay a bribe every time they interacted with the police. Overall, the cost of corruption in Africa is estimated at more than $148 billion a year, according to African Union estimates. Yet ipaidabribe.or.ke is not the only attempt to use information technology as a tool in the fight against corruption in Africa as an increasing number of similar websites have popped up across the continent. Also based on India's I Paid A Bribe, Bribe Nigeria was set up last summer by Leonard Raphael to raise awareness about corruption and address its impact on the West African country. \"Corruption is an endemic disease that has eaten up every facet of the Nigerian society,\" says Raphael, pointing to the case of a father who was asked by police officers to give them money for fuel after they came to his house to search for his son who was just kidnapped. \"As soon as corruption can be controlled in Nigeria, every other sustainable development can henceforth progress,\" adds Raphael. In South Africa, Corruption Watch was launched in late January in a bid to encourage people to join their voices against the problem. So far, the group says it has collected some 1,200 reports from all corners of the country through its online reporting form, an SMS line, social media and by email or post. \"It's designed principally to show to people that by reporting and by speaking up something can happen,\" says the group's executive director David Lewis. \"The way of changing things in a democracy is to speak up and to speak as much as possible with a connected voice,\" he adds.

Ben Elers, director of programs at Transparency International, says that all these initiatives can be a powerful tool in the fight against corruption. \"I think they are essential in giving citizens a voice, they're enabling them to voice their frustrations,\" he says. He adds, however, that since the complaints are generally anonymous, it can be difficult to follow up on them. \"Ultimately they are tools and what happens afterwards in changing the physical world is what counts at the end of the day,\" he says. \"So, they are critical but in of themselves they're not sufficient, they need concrete follow-up afterwards.\" Back in Kenya, Ragui is optimistic that the use of technology can help things change. \"Kenyans are tired,\" he says. \"We need a new generation of Kenyans who are actually positive, hard-working, people who don't want to get a short-term gain, people who are actually thinking the only way to make a difference in our country is for people to say no to corruption.\"","target":"African activists are increasingly turning to technology to fight endemic corruption .\nWebsites allow victims of graft to share their bribe stories online and track incidents of corruption .\nThey contain detailed information about the amount of money paid and the location of the bribe .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Antony Ragui, a financial services consultant, has launched a website, ipaidabribe.or.ke, to combat public corruption in Kenya.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Nokia is getting into the tablet business. The company announced a new 10-inch tablet called the Lumia 2520 on Tuesday at a press event in Abu Dhabi. The Windows RT device is Nokia's first full-sized tablet. The Finnish company is also going bigger with its smartphone line. It is releasing a new pair of colorful, big-screen smartphones: the 6-inch Windows Phone 9 Lumia 1520 and the lower-end 1320. The Lumia 2520 tablet will cost $499 and run Windows RT 8.1, a limited variation of the Windows 8 operating system that uses that system's tile-based touchscreen feature. The tablet gets 4G LTE, has a 2.2 GHz Quad Core processor and includes a 6.7 megapixel back-facing camera. The company says it has upped the screen's peak brightness so it's extra visible outdoors in direct sunlight. For its new smartphones, Nokia has chosen to continue its focus on the camera as the killer feature that can set its devices apart. Its Lumia 1020 smartphone's primary selling point was its impressive 40 megapixel camera. The new big-screen 1520 smartphone will have a smaller but still powerful 20 megapixel camera and cost $749 before any carrier subsides. The the cheaper 1320 has a more ordinary 5 megapixel camera and cost $399. The Nokia Camera app is getting an update across all Nokia devices. Six inches is a hefty size for smartphones, but Ifi Majid, Nokia's head of product marketing for North America, said the size was key because it's the largest a phone can go and still be held with one hand. While they haven't yet taken off in the U.S., \"phablet\" devices are a bigger hit in developing markets where the larger size is considered a status symbol. This is Nokia's first big product rollout since it was announced that Microsoft was going to purchase part of the company. The $7.2 billion deal, which will include Nokia's devices and services businesses, is still pending. It's unclear what kind of different direction Nokia's products will take when Microsoft is fully in charge, and where the new 2520 tablet will fit in with Windows own similar Surface line. Apple is the leading tablet manufacturer in the world, followed by Samsung, but all the major manufacturers are eager to get in on the growing market. Though Microsoft has been pushing its own Surface tablets and touchscreen-ified operating system, Windows 8, it still trails far behind iOS and Android tablets. Nokia was once the top mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It still holds on to a sizable chunk of the feature phone market, but is struggling to stay competitive against smartphones from Apple, Samsung, and other companies. Instead of making an Android-based smartphone like most non-Apple companies, Nokia took a bet on a third operating system, Windows Phone 8. Colorful and simple, but with an anemic selection of apps, Windows Phone 8 has struggled but slowly grown since making its debut a year ago. Getting big name apps has been one of the operating systems biggest challenges. Nokia says photo-sharing app Instagram will finally come to the platform in the next few weeks. There is still a market for less advanced phones that can last more than a day on a single battery charge. Nokia also announced three new Asha devices on Tuesday. Asha is Nokia's super simple, very cheap phone line. The tiny handsets cost between $60 and $99 and can make calls and text, run a few apps and even connect to the internet. Aimed at developing markets, they can also hold a charge for up to a month.","target":"Nokia announced its first tablet, the 10-inch Lumia 2520 running Windows RT .\nThe company also announced a pair of large, 6-inch smartphones .\nThis is Nokia's first big press event since Microsoft announced it was buying part of the business .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Nokia has announced its entry into the tablet market with the Lumia 2520, a 10-inch tablet running on Windows RT 8.1.

{"question":"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- People in big cities walk past them every day -- street performers, or buskers. Some are talented, some are not, and most aren't performing for a cause greater than themselves. But on Monday, 12-year-old Abby Miller was. Abby Miller sings for her friend Taylor Love outside Washington's Union Station on Monday. She was performing outside Washington's Union Station to help her 4-year-old friend, Taylor Love, who is suffering from cancer. Abby sat in front of the station with a couple of her friends, singing songs and strumming a guitar. Passers-by seemed to notice the girl's singing talent, stopping to listen in the chilly weather, with a few putting money in a bucket at Abby's feet. Abby said the money will help support Taylor's family. A few more stopped to write messages on \"Love Notes,\" little cards designed to encourage Taylor Love through the tough time. \"Her mom reads them to her before she goes to bed at night,\" Abby said. \"Taylor gets excited for them and she loves getting them read to her because she likes knowing that people are supporting her and people are actually thinking of her.\" Taylor has neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects the nervous system. According to her Web site, she is in remission, but this type of cancer has a high risk of recurrence. There has been little research on the illness, of which there are about 650 new cases in the United States each year. Mike Gillette, a family friend of both Taylor and Abby, brought the two girls together. While raising money and support for Taylor is important, he said, he thinks Abby's outreach can help bring more critical awareness for the devastating disease. \"She really wanted to reach people all over the country,\" he said. Gillette said he has taken Abby to do similar performances in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Virginia, and estimates they've raised thousands of dollars and have gotten people to write several hundred \"Love Notes.\" Abby does more than just raise money and awareness for her friend. Taylor's mother, Aimee, said that although Abby is eight years older than Taylor, the two see each other often and have a special connection that helps her get through her daughter's illness. \"I think it's amazing for a 12-year-old Abby to be drawn to my daughter, who is 4 and wants to inspire other children,\" Aimee Love said. \"The joy I see in Taylor when she sees Abby brings a light into my life.\" Taylor's family said her treatments are terribly painful. But Abby said Taylor has enormous character. \"She's the most happy girl in the world, which I think is just incredible,\" Abby said. \"She's so much fun to be around. She's a little 4-year-old girl but she's got a heart of like a thousand grown adults.\" Aimee Love said her daughter feels the same way about Abby. \"It gives her someone to aspire to, someone to be inspired by,\" she said.","target":"Abby Miller sings, plays guitar to help 4-year-old friend with cancer .\nAbby collects donations, has people write notes of support for Taylor Love .\nTaylor has neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects the nervous system .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"12-year-old street performer, Abby Miller, is using her talent to support her 4-year-old friend, Taylor Love, who is battling neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects the nervous system.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council arrived in Saudi Arabia Monday for a meeting to discuss transforming their six nations into a union similar to the European Union. The idea of integrating the GCC nations into one entity -- and replacing what exists now as simply a cooperative -- was first floated by Saudi Arabia in December. Monday's meeting in Riyadh will lay out the timetable for it. The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. \"The threats of all kinds require the hard works of the GCC countries to shift from a current formula of cooperation to a union formula acceptable to the six countries,\" Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal said last month. He didn't specify what threats he was referring to. But some analysts have said the GCC move could be an effort to counter the growing influence of Shiite Iran. The GCC was formed in 1981, soon after Iran instituted a Shiite theocracy and went to war with primarily Sunni Iraq. Iran and Iraq have enjoyed closer ties in recent years, especially as Iraq's Shia Muslim majority has solidified its power in the absence of former leader Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Muslim. After U.S. forces pulled out of Iraq last year, Tehran expanded military and security cooperation with Baghdad. Also, GCC member Bahrain blames Iran for fueling the anti-government unrest that continues to roil the country. Tehran has denied involvement. Bahrain is a predominantly Shiite country, ruled by a Sunni royal family. Last year, at the height of the protests, Bahrain called in troops from member nations Saudi Arabia and the UAE and cracked down. Iran is also engaged in a longtime dispute with the UAE over three Persian Gulf islands; Abu Mousa, and Greater and Lesser Tunb. The UAE says Iran has illegally occupied the islands. Iran views them as part of its territory. \"I think President (Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad, when he visited the Abu Mousa island a couple weeks ago, in a way he highlighted the need for the union to counter the adventurism of the Iranian government,\" said GCC Assistant Secretary General Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg. In this climate comes the GCC move to form a union. \"Such strategic vision would include common approaches to defense, security, political and economic long-term interests,\" Aluwaisheg said in an opinion piece Sunday in the Saudi English-language daily, Arab News. Already, Al Wefaq, Bahrain's main Shiite opposition party, has demanded that the Bahraini government put the idea to a popular vote before it agrees. \"The people of the states of the European Union voted on the union decision before the union was announced. The people of the Gulf should also have their say,\" said Al-Wefaq Secretary General Shaikh Ali Salman. Aluwaisheg disagrees. \"The GCC is much more popular among the people than the EU (is) among the people of Europe. It's extremely popular,\" he said. \"No need to take a vote because it's really a done deal. If anything, the GCC has always been criticized for being too slow.\"","target":"NEW: Leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council arrive in Saudi Arabia .\nA union is needed to \"counter the adventurism\" of Iran, an official says .\n\"Threats of all kinds\" require such a union, the Saudi foreign minister says .\nBahrain blames Iran for the anti-government protests .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, met in Saudi Arabia to discuss transforming their six nations into a union similar to the European Union.

Another 2,500 cases of cholera, a deadly water-borne disease, have been diagnosed in Cameroon since an outbreak warning in June. About 70 percent of people living in the country's far north region, bordering Nigeria and Chad, do not have access to potable water, according to a Ministry of Water and Energy official. Sanitation is also limited in the area and recent flooding has aggravated the situation. UNICEF said it has dispatched emergency medical kits containing surgical gloves, water treatment tablets, cholera medicine, oral rehydration salts and educational materials. The United Nations children's agency said the outbreak could be devastating for children, who are especially vulnerable. The disease is caused by contaminated water, and many people with cholera suffer acute watery diarrhea, which leads to severe dehydration.

{"question":"Washington (CNN) -- About half the schools in Tennessee didn't meet the annual yearly progress requirements of the No Child Left Behind law last year. Tennessee is not alone. Saying schools are struggling to meet the student progress requirements of the No Child Left Behind law, the White House announced Monday it would be signing waivers that will relieve schools of some of the key provisions of the law. \"The law -- No Child Left Behind -- as it currently stands is four years overdue for being rewritten. It is far too punitive, it is far too prescriptive, lead to a dummying down of standards, lead to a narrowing of the curriculum,\" Education Secretary Arne Duncan said at a White House press briefing on Monday. \"We can't afford to have the law of the land be one that has so many perverse incentives or disincentives to the kind of progress that we want to see.\" The law requires that all students meet reading and math adequacy by 2014. If they don't, the schools are subject to reforms. As the standards have increased annually, schools are finding it increasingly difficult to meet them. \"We hope that this is simply a transition or bridge to fixing the law,\" Duncan said of the waiver plans. Rather than a large sweeping bill to reauthorize the entire Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), also known as No Child Left Behind Act, Rep. John Kline's committee has been working on smaller, more specific bills throughout the summer, to address ESEA concerns. The Republican-led House Education and the Workforce committee has passed three bills intended to streamline education programs, address charter school issues and give states and localities more flexibility in spending their federal dollars. These bills have not yet made it to the House floor for debate, nor have they come up in the Democratic-led Senate for debate. Only one of the bills -- the one on charter schools -- passed out of the House committee with bipartisan support. The committee is expected to take up separate legislation on teacher effectiveness and accountability this fall. \"I remain concerned that temporary measures instituted by the Department (of Education), such as conditional waivers, could undermine the committee's efforts to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,\" Kline, R-Minnesota, said in a statement Friday. Duncan said the Education Department will announce the standards under which the waivers will be granted in September but in the meantime, they encourage all states to apply. Duncan said he had talked to more than 30 governors about the waiver plan. \"I have not spoken to one governor that wasn't very enthusiastic about this,\" he said. Tennessee applied for a waiver to the law late last month, according to Kelli Gauthier of the Department of Education there. Without a waiver, Tennessee would be \"responsible for intervening in a large number of its 'failing' schools; a role the department has neither the desire nor the capacity to take on,\" according to Gauthier. Tennessee is still waiting to see if Secretary Duncan approves their request.","target":"Education Secretary Duncan hopes this is transition to fix for law .\nCurrent law leads \"to a dummying down of standards\"\nHouse panel has passed 3 education-related bills .\nHead of panel says he's concerned about temporary measures .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Approximately half of Tennessee's schools failed to meet the annual progress requirements of the No Child Left Behind law last year, reflecting a nationwide struggle.

{"question":"Barcelona, Spain (CNN) -- Not content with revolutionizing smart phones, mobile apps now appear to be in the driving seat of the auto industry as manufacturers increasingly surrender control of their vehicles to technology. Signs of the increasing dominance of the app came on Monday with Ford's decision to launch its newest B-Max compact at Mobile World Congress -- a phone industry gathering in Barcelona -- rather than a motor show. Read more: Powerful camera phone unveiled . Bill Ford, the U.S. auto giant's executive chairman, told CNN his company chose the event to debut its tech-filled car as a statement of its intention to work with app developers in shaping the vehicles of the future. The B-Max is the first car in Europe to feature SYNC, a voice-recognition system developed by Ford and already available in some U.S. cars. The system links audio, phone and GPS systems and will also call emergency services in the event of a crash. The increasing dependence of vehicles on computers has raised concerns that manufacturers are trading technology for safety, exposing drivers to hazardous distractions and malicious hackers. But Ford, the great grandson of Henry Ford, insisted SYNC would \"allow drivers to keep their eyes on the road and their hands on the steering wheel,\" and said his company was working with app makers to further improve security. \"Today, often, drivers are looking down and we know that they're playing with their cell phone and texting and we want to stop all that,\" he told CNN. \"We want them to be looking at the road with their hands on the wheel, and our tech is allowing them to do that, knowing they also want to be connected.\" Ford said his firm's current crop of hi-tech cars were capable of utilizing offboard \"cloud computing\" to expand their abilities, performing tasks like directing drivers to the nearest coffee shops, checking their health and keeping tabs on their daily diary. He acknowledged this raised the prospect of potential breaches that could put valuable personal data in the hands of criminals but said the technology was currently being rolled out on an \"opt-in, opt-out\" basis. The carmaker said the B-Max would eventually run its AppLink system, which will add control of smartphone apps to voice-operated commands. Among currently available apps are programs that read out Twitter updates and pick and choose radio stations. More functions will follow as it partners with app developers, the company said in a statement. \"Ford aims to deliver voice-control compatibility with apps for a wide range of services, and is now actively seeking to partner with app developers on future opportunities,\" it said in a statement. Ford hopes the B-Max, which goes on sale in Europe later this year, will help expand its current 4 million U.S. SYNC users to 13 million worldwide by 2015. It says the car should appeal to drivers previously priced out of the hi-tech market. \"The all-new B-MAX is going to be a game-changer in the European compact family vehicle segment. No other vehicle in its class offers such an attractive combination of style, versatility and technology,\" Ford Europe's chairman and CEO Stephen Odell said in a statement. \"We think it will be among the most technologically advanced small cars you can buy at any price.\" Barry Neild contributed to this story from London.","target":"Ford chooses to launch compact car at mobile phone event rather than a motor show .\nB-Max features Ford's latest voice-activated technology .\nFord says it wants to work with app developers in shaping its future vehicles .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Mobile apps are increasingly influencing the auto industry, as demonstrated by Ford's decision to launch its new B-Max compact at the Mobile World Congress, a phone industry event, instead of a motor show.

{"question":"(CNN) -- For all the heavy baggage that she carries, Hillary Clinton is walking on water. Ham-fisted attempts by the Republicans to smear her brain have backfired horribly (rightly so; they were distasteful), while Republican efforts to hang Benghazi around her neck (Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tried this weekend) have barely dented her popularity among Democrats. Obama calls her a \"buddy\" who would make a \"very effective\" president, and the former secretary of state remains clear front-runner for her party's 2016 presidential nomination. In fact, right now, she's the only real runner. And that can't be healthy -- for democracy, for the Democrats or even for Clinton. How can we be sure she's running? Well, the United States might be the only country in the world where a politician signals his or her ambitions by writing a book. This does not, alas, mean that America's politicians are unusually literate. Often, the book is bad; usually, it's ghostwritten; only occasionally is it worth reading. But it's generally a sign. The title of Hillary Clinton's \"Hard Choices\" -- out on June 9 and helpfully promoted by a series of interviews with TV's biggest anchors -- suggests a woman who is trying to make sense of a troubled recent past. Becoming Obama's secretary of state, Egypt, Libya and the Benghazi fiasco were all arguably \"choices\" forced upon her. That they were \"hard\" implies an admission that the outcome was far from desirable. Clinton is a potential presidential candidate who has to deal with not just one compromised record but two. First, the Bill Clinton administration; second, the Obama administration. In both cases, she seems keen to remind us, she wasn't technically in charge. Such is the strange ambiguity of Hillary Rodham Clinton. First, she was the co-president and architect of Bill's most ambitious domestic reforms, the anti-Tammy Wynette. Then, she was the betrayed wife who did stand by her man. Next the liberal senator, the presidential candidate of the overwhelming majority of the establishment, suddenly a primaries loser who had to reinvent herself as Annie Oakley, finally a loyal servant of the President, a man whose abilities she questioned so rudely in the nomination battle. Like Richard Nixon before her, she is one of those politicians who is defined by longevity. Her politics have changed so often that it's hard to precisely define what Clintonism is anymore, but she has lasted so long in the spotlight that it's become almost impossible to conceive that someday she won't be president. That 2016 is Clinton's time is reflected in the surprising, even depressing, lack of an alternative. What is Vice President Joe Biden doing with his weekends? Or Newark Mayor Cory Booker (who has ruled himself out, if you can believe that)? Or New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo? Without them, who are we left with? Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, headed for Iowa but probably not very well known there? Sen. Elizabeth Warren, sometimes pushed as the working-class Hillary but who would probably be unelectable outside of Massachusetts? Warren, interestingly, has written a book, too. Contrast this silence with the Republican side. The GOP is weighing up Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (whether they've showed any interest in running or not), and this pre-contest contest gives the impression that all the action is on the right while the Democrats just sit out what remains of Obama's second term, waiting for the whole thing to come to a dignified end. Stabenow: Why I'm ready for Hillary . And the Republican struggle is attractively philosophical. Paul represents the rise of libertarianism; Christie channels the spirit of Mayor Richard Daley; Bush is our generation's Nelson Rockefeller; Santorum is running to build heaven on Earth. These people are discussing ideas that will shape the future of the country. Clinton is talking largely about herself. Of course, two years is almost an eternity in politics, and things might change. At pretty much this point in the 2008 contest, Clinton also commanded a lead over her opponents and looked set to win the nomination -- and we all know what happened come Iowa. She is a different kind of politician now, having built statesman status with her time as secretary of state. But headed into her second go at the nomination after over 20 years of dominating the national stage, it's possible that many voters will simply decide that they want a change. Is America really so locked in its partisan, elitist politics that would tolerate another Clinton vs. Bush campaign? Those who think continuity is unhealthy in a democracy might judge not.","target":"Tim Stanley: Hillary Clinton bashed by GOP, praised by Obama and still front-runner .\nHe says she has new book, top anchors interviewing her; this usually signals candidacy .\nShe must deal with two compromised records, with two administrations, he says .\nStanley: GOP weighing many candidates.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Fourth seed Andy Murray has crashed out of the prestigious Indian Wells tournament in California, beaten in straight sets by Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez in his opening match. The British number one lost to American Donald Young at the same stage last year -- and history repeated itself on Saturday when world number 92 Garcia-Lopez cruised to a 6-4 6-2 success. \"My return let me down and he hardly missed the ball either,\" Murray told the official ATP Tour website. \"The level of tennis nowadays you get no easy first round matches and, if you play a poor match, that's what happens. \"I don't know exactly why because I was playing really, really good tennis the whole of the week and the buildup to it,\" added Murray, who made 34 unforced errors and had his serve broken three times in a one hour, 40 minute defeat. A delighted Garcia-Lopez said: \"It's one of the biggest wins in my career and it gives me a lot of confidence, as my ranking right now is not too good. \"This victory gives me some confidence that I can do much better this season,\" he continued. There were no such problems for world number one and defending champion Novak Djokovic, who beat Kazakh qualifier Andrey Golubev 6-3 6-2, the same player he defeated in his opening match in last year's tournament. The Serb told reporters: \"There were a lot of unforced errors but it was the opening match and I am still trying to adjust to this court and get used to the conditions.\" There were also wins for seventh seed Tomas Berdych and eighth seed Mardy Fish, but amongst those to also go out were Richard Gasquet, Kei Nishikori and Florian Mayer -- seeded 16th, 17th and 18th respectively.

{"question":"U.S. and coalition warplanes pounded ISIS positions in eastern Syria on Wednesday, targeting what a Pentagon official described as mobile oil refineries being used by the so-called Islamic State terror group to help finance its operations. The latest round of airstrikes were aimed at cutting off money flowing to ISIS, which makes up to $2 million a day from oil produced by the mobile refineries, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, told CNN. Fighter jets from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates flew alongside U.S. aircraft during the operation, hitting 12 locations, Kirby said. While the U.S. military was still assessing the outcome of the attacks, Kirby said initial indications suggest the strikes were successful. \"We are very confident we hit what we were aiming at, and we caused the damage we wanted,\" he said. The airstrikes came just hours after U.S. President Barack Obama called for united action to confront ISIS, also referred to as ISIL. \"It is no exaggeration to say that humanity's future depends on us uniting against those who would divide us along fault lines of tribe or sect; race or religion,\" Obama said in an address before the U.N. General Assembly. \"This is not simply a matter of words. Collectively, we must take concrete steps to address the danger posed by religiously motivated fanatics, and the trends that fuel their recruitment.\" China, Russia raise questions . Obama's call for action comes as questions were raised over his decision to bomb terror groups in Syria without approval from the U.N. Security Council. Even as the Security Council adopted a resolution drawn up by the United States addressing the growing threat posed by foreign fighters, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the world must act -- but only with U.N. approval. Airstrikes get Bill Clinton's approval . Russia's foreign minister warned \"against any attempt to narrow down the problem\" to select groups, urging the world not to have \"double standards in dividing terrorists into good terrorists and bad terrorists.\" China and Russia, both permanent members of the Security Council, have blocked a number of attempts to force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down as a way to bring about an end to the civil war that has since seen the rise of ISIS and other terror groups. Still, while the U.S.-led military action in Syria hasn't been widely embraced, those involved in the international coalition in Iraq is growing. The Dutch foreign ministry announced Wednesday that its military will contribute six F-16 fighter jets and 250 troops to carry out airstrikes and train Iraqi and Kurdish forces. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said his country's parliament will weigh a request for six of its fighter jets to take part in the bombing campaign. Similarly, British Prime Minister David Cameron said he's recalling Parliament Friday \"to secure approval for the United Kingdom to participate in the Iraq air campaign. \"The U.N. Security Council has now received a clear request from the Iraqi government to support it in its military action against ISIL,\" Cameron said from U.N. headquarters in New York. \"... So it is right that Britain should move to a new phase of action.\" More airstrikes . The latest airstrikes against the refineries followed another round carried out overnight Tuesday into Wednesday against five more targets: four in Iraq and one in Syria, according to U.S. Central Command. In Syria, U.S. and coalition fighter jets struck an ISIS staging area near the Iraqi border, northwest of al Qaim, damaging eight ISIS vehicles. In Iraq, two airstrikes west of Baghdad destroyed two ISIS armed vehicles and a weapons cache. Two airstrikes southeast of the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil destroyed ISIS fighting positions. Conceding that airstrikes so far haven't flushed out ISIS in Iraq, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that American air power may nonetheless have prevented the fall of Baghdad and Irbil to the militants. \"What we've done is we've stopped the onslaught,\" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. The airstrikes in Syria have also targeted ISIS' proclaimed capital of Raqqa. Share your view on the airstrikes . Activist: ISIS fighters keep low profile . An activist from Raqqa, who uses the pseudonym Maher al-Ahmad, told CNN he'd gone back to the town after the airstrikes. \"It's the first time I didn't see ISIS in the streets, that I was able to walk around, because I am wanted by them,\" said al-Ahmad, who moves between Raqqa and Turkey's Gaziantep province. He said people who were there during the strikes described them as feeling like earthquakes. Some 20 to 25 vehicles filled with ISIS fighters, including people he believes were senior leadership because of the level of security around them, left the city within hours of the attacks, the activist said. After keeping a low profile during the day, the ISIS fighters were out in the streets again by Tuesday evening but in lower numbers than usual, he said. ISIS fighters began moving into the homes of civilians in the past two to three weeks, al-Ahmad said, raising fears that the civilians may be used as human shields or fall victim to future airstrikes. Hassan al-Halabi, an activist from Aleppo, voiced similar fears, saying residents there have two main concerns about upcoming strikes in Syria. \"The first is that they are afraid of having civilian casualties because ISIS members and fighters are among civilians,\" al-Halabi said. \"And the second concern is that what will happen after that? Who will replace ISIS, especially that the regime is ready to take control of ISIS' areas?\"","target":"British Parliament -- like Belgium's -- will weigh request to participate in Iraq airstrikes .\nAirstrikes have resumed in eastern Syria, a U.S. official tells CNN .\nPresident Barack Obama urges ISIS fighters to \"leave the battlefield while they can\"\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry: U.S. airstrikes have \"stopped the onslaught\"","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The U.S. and coalition warplanes targeted ISIS positions in eastern Syria, specifically mobile oil refineries used by the group to finance its operations.

{"question":"(CNN) -- It was not a blanket of snow that fell on the Northeast this past weekend. It was more like a futon of snow. A stack of futons. And not the light foam futons, but old-fashioned futons stuffed with horsehair or maybe potting soil. Sodden futons stacked 3 feet high with no place to shovel them. But ignore my bitterness. I'm old and I just got in from shoveling the part of our driveway that the next civic-minded city plow is going to refill. In truth, New England handled this snow emergency like a champ -- so much better than the Blizzard of '78 in which people died stuck in their cars on the highway. But before we break out the cocoa and self-congratulations, we might want to listen to Espen Andersen, a Norwegian in Oslo who lived in Boston for nine years. I blogged on Saturday about how well-prepared the Northeast was, and Espen jumped in with a \"Yeah, but ...\" comment. \"I just can't get used to the New England oh-my-God-here-it-comes-again-flip-to-channel-5 attitude,\" he wrote. He explained: \"The fact that New England panics every time there is a flurry is due to lack of preparedness at the infrastructure level. In most of Norway, power and telephone lines are underground, it is illegal not to have snow tires on your car after December 1st or thereabouts (if you go in the ditch, you are fined) and during my own and my children's school days we have never had a snow day or any other interruption due to the weather (and we have plenty of weather). I have never been to the store to stock up on batteries and water. ... Our airport does not close down for snow, though there can be delays.\" My pride makes me want to push back on the idea that we New Englanders \"panic\" in the face of blizzards, not to mention that referring to this past weekend's unpleasantness as \"a flurry\" goes beyond Nordic stoicism. On the other hand, I remember being amused as a grad student watching the recent immigrants from sunny Mediterranean climes spinning their tires in a modest Toronto snowfall. What goes around comes around, and those Mediterranean tires were going around at an unmoving 60 mph. But Espen raises a valid question: \"Why doesn't New England harden the grid and communications systems, put winter tires on school buses, mandate winter tires in snowy conditions and just get rid of this stupid idea of snow days? It is winter; it happens almost every year.\" I'd suggest there are two reasons we don't. We'd all like to see the poles and wires that blight our landscape come down. Not only would this reduce power outages due to downed trees, it might also give us an opportunity to pull some optical fiber into our homes and businesses so that the United States could stop falling behind the developed world in high-speed Internet access. So let's do it. Except, it's expensive. All those trenches to dig. All those rights of way to clear. All those transformers to move indoors. The bullet to bite is so large that we're more willing to dribble out the price of sending out repair crews, and to put up with the far more substantial costs borne by individuals and businesses that go without power for hours, days and sometimes weeks. The aggregated cost of being without electricity for the 655,000 people plunged into the cold and dark by the so-called Nemo storm, are distributed among the sufferers, and thus that cost is invisible, as is everything if one closes one's eyes hard enough. Besides, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick estimated that it would cost $1 trillion to bury all the power lines throughout the commonwealth. Various experts I consulted (via the advanced knowledge network known as mailing lists) supplied counter guesstimates of $45 billion to $200 billion, but with caveats about everything from the frequency of buried rocks to the increased difficulty of fixing broken underground cables. Still, that's between three and 70 Big Digs, to use our local unit of currency. Not chump change, no matter how you measure it. Which brings us to the second reason we don't bite the bullet and snow-proof our infrastructure: We think of snowstorms as emergencies that inevitably bring with them power outages and snow days, so we don't demand a snow-proof infrastructure. Yes, this is circular reasoning. We don't demand a fix because we don't see the system as broken. It takes a Norwegian to have us wonder why we're shutting down our cities as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Even if we overcame both reasons and buried our power and communication lines, I doubt that we would escape all snow-caused work stoppages. Maybe I'm just being a panicky New Englander, but when 2 to 3 feet of snow drops on your city so fast that you can practically hear the thump, I can't imagine how we'd get our streets and trolley tracks cleaned fast enough to avoid a day when it's better if everyone just stays at home, does some shoveling and watches \"Buffy\" seasons 1-4. For, as Espen points out, if we didn't treat snow as an emergency, we wouldn't get our snow days. And we love our snow days. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Weinberger.","target":"David Weinberger: Blizzard not the worst, but why isn't New England better prepared?\nHe says an Oslo commenter to his blog notes Norway is more sensible about snow .\nLike Norway, New England could bury power lines, snow-proof infrastructure, he says .\nWriter: It's too costly, and in the end, people don't see storms as disasters -- just as snow days .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The Northeastern U.S. experienced a heavy snowfall over the weekend, which was handled well by New England, despite the inconvenience of shoveling and power outages.

The article suggests two reasons for this: the high cost of burying power lines and the acceptance of snowstorms as emergencies that inevitably cause power outages and snow days.

{"question":"(CNN) -- A valuable necklace was stolen from a party at the Cannes Film Festival, the second major jewelry theft at the event this year, police said Thursday. Jeweler de Grisogono said the necklace, which was part of a collection making its debut, was worth 2 million euros ($2.6 million). The company said it was the first theft in the company's 20-year history. Police in Nice, France, confirmed the heist but said the necklace was only worth 1 million euros ($1.3 million U.S.). Police in Cap d'Antibes, the posh resort town where the party was held, gave a third figure -- $1 million (773,000 euros). The de Grisogono statement said it had hired more than 80 security guards for the event at the Cap Eden Roc hotel in Cap d'Antibes, just east of Cannes. On Friday, police in Nice said that more than $1 million in jewels belonging to the Swiss firm Chopard had been stolen from a hotel room in Cannes. Chopard later said in a statement that the value of the stolen pieces was \"far lower than those in the figures circulating in the media.\" The theft of the jewels occurred May 16, on the second day of the festival, which runs through May 26. Commandant Bernard Mascarelli of the Nice police said the jewelry was stolen from a room in the Suite Novotel hotel on Boulevard Carnot in Cannes. A Chopard employee who was staying in the room left it for several hours to go to dinner, he said. She returned to discover the whole safe containing the jewels had been unscrewed and taken away. No detailed description of the stolen jewels has been given, but a Chopard spokeswoman said they were not part of the firm's \"Red Carpet Collection 2013\" and were not due to be worn by any actresses in Cannes.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Two young women arrested in Peru on suspicion of drug trafficking are in good condition and being well treated while in detention, a senior clergyman in Lima said Tuesday. The women, Melissa Reid, 19, from Scotland and Michaella McCollum, 20, from Ireland, were arrested by Peruvian national police at Jorge Chavez International Airport in the capital on August 6. They were stopped as they tried to board an Air Europa flight from Lima to Madrid after authorities allegedly found 11.59 kilograms (25.5 pounds) of cocaine in their luggage. Their final destination was Palma de Mallorca. The cocaine was found inside pouches of oatmeal and dehydrated foods. \"I was forced to take these bags in my luggage,\" said Reid, in video footage of the police interrogation. McCollum's family issued a statement Tuesday saying that they stand behind their daughter and are making arrangements to go to Peru. \"Michaella's family are obviously shocked and distressed by the recent events but are confident that Michaella will be exonerated,\" family attorney Peter Madden said. According to police, the pair were contacted by a Colombian named \"Enrique\" in Palma de Mallorca through a tourism company that flew them to Lima and then to Machu Picchu. But the tourism was cover for a plan to smuggle the drugs, police told CNN. Archbishop of Lima Sean Walsh, an Irish-American bishop who's been in Peru for the past seven years, told CNN he was able to meet briefly with the young women in the police cell where they are being held. He said the two are in good condition, are eating well, have clean clothing and are receiving good care. Walsh dismissed media reports suggesting they are not being treated well and that one of the women is on a hunger strike. Reid and McCollum are expected to appear before a judge Wednesday, he said. The Ministry of Justice normally has an official translator present, said Walsh, who often visits foreigners held in jail in Lima. While he was visiting the women, a prosecutor entered and told them that they needed to cooperate as fully as possible, Walsh said. He expects to see the pair again Wednesday evening, he added. They do not yet have an attorney to represent them that he knows of, Walsh said. The court system in Peru usually provides a public defender but they may try to hire private defense lawyers, he added. Walsh said he had also been in touch with the parents of both young women, who are feeling fear and shame over their arrest. He said McCollum's parents told him she had been calling them every day from Ibiza, the Spanish island on which, according to UK media reports, the two girls had been spending the summer. But the calls home stopped, he said, and the parents then started a social media campaign to find her. A UK Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We can confirm the arrest of a British national in Peru on 7 August. We are providing consular assistance.\" A spokeswoman for Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said it was providing consular assistance to Connolly and her family through the Irish Embassy in Mexico, and was also working with the British Embassy in Lima. Peru is now the world's top cultivator of coca -- the plant whose leaves are used to produce cocaine -- having overtaken Colombia for the dubious honor.","target":"Peruvian police are holding two young women suspected of drug trafficking .\nMelissa Reid, held with Michaella McCollum, says she was made to carry the bags .\nArchbishop of Lima Sean Walsh says the two are being well treated in detention .\nUK and Irish authorities say they are providing consular assistance to the two women .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Two young women, Melissa Reid from Scotland and Michaella McCollum from Ireland, were arrested in Peru on suspicion of drug trafficking after authorities allegedly found 11.59 kilograms of cocaine in their luggage.

{"question":"Rabun County, Georgia (CNN) -- One look at the landscape and you know why people come here -- running white water, along a portion of the Appalachian Trail. This is Rabun County, Georgia. It was the residents' own best-kept secret until the world discovered it by way of a 1972 movie. The movie, \"Deliverance,\" made tourist dollars flow into the area, but there was one memorable, horrifying male rape scene that lasted a little more than four minutes, but has lasted 40 years inside the hearts and minds of the people who live here. Locals say the film painted the county's residents as deviant, uneducated mountain folk. \"We were portrayed as ignorant, backward, scary, deviant, redneck hillbillies,\" said Rabun County Commissioner Stanley \"Butch\" Darnell. \"That stuck with us through all these years and in fact that was probably furthest from the truth. These people up here are a very caring, lovely people.\" This weekend, the film's 40th anniversary will be celebrated at the Chattooga River Festival. A re-release of the iconic film on Blu-ray by Warner Home Video will play at the local drive-in on Saturday. The film tells the story of four big-city guys who take a drive up to northern Georgia to canoe the white water of the Chattooga River that separates Georgia from South Carolina. It's remembered for the dueling banjo scene at the beginning of the film, where one man, played by Ronnie Cox, plays a duet with a local teen, who is portrayed as inbred and mentally challenged. \"Dueling banjos, of course, was iconic, but then there's the rape scene, too,\" Cox said. \"And for a lot of people it became a tough pill to swallow. \"Some people, I think they missed the artistic essence of it (the film), the value of it.\" But it's the rape scene that seems to dominate any conversation about the film. \"You were in the middle of the Bible Belt, the biggest thing we had gong back then is we had square dancing at the Mountain City Playhouse,\" said Darnell, the county commissioner. But many people, like Billy Redden, say the local folks should put this behind them. The 40th anniversary means a lot to him. He's 56 now, but 40 years ago, he was a student who was asked to play the \"Banjo boy\" after the film's producers found him on a visit to his high school. \"I don't think it should bother them. I think they just need to start realizing that it's just a movie. It's not like it's real,\" said Redden, who still lives in Rabun County. But despite any negative stereotypes, the Rabun County Convention and Visitor's Bureau says more than a quarter-million people flock to the area each year to shoot the same rapids they saw come to life on the big screen. The South: Not all Bubbas and banjos . \"It essentially started the white-water rafting industry in the Southeast, \" said Larry Mashburn, who owns Southeastern Expeditions, a rafting company. County officials say tourism brings in $42 million a year in revenue, which makes for a huge surplus for a county whose operating budget is about $17 million. These days, the county has an 80% high school graduation rate, and its average home price is more than $300,000. \"It's allowed us to do things with our education system, with all these different services that we offer, we could not have offered,\" Darnell said. The area has become a playground for high-end homeowners with lakefront property in the multimillion-dollar range on places like Lake Burton, which has 62 miles of shoreline. \"Once people come to Rabun County, they don't want to leave,\" said Debra Butler, a real estate agent. \"This is a lifestyle that you have here. It's a way of life. 'Deliverance' depicts a backwoods, inbred kind of community. That is not Rabun County.\" Indeed, downtown shops and art galleries convey an image far from anything portrayed in the 1972 film. Jeanne Kronsoble's Main Street Gallery in Clayton shows off a wide range of contemporary folk artists, many self-taught. She's been open for 28 years. \"I became interested in contemporary folk art because of the things I'd seen up here,\" she said. \"When people build houses and they come here, they need art on their walls.\" Most believe \"Deliverance\" got it all started. But despite this prosperity, the 40-year pain has managed to hang on, because so many people saw a fictional film. \"There are lots of people in Rabun County that would be just as happy if they never heard the word, 'Deliverance' again,\" Darnell said.","target":"The 1972 movie \"Deliverance\" was shot in Rabun County, Georgia .\nThe film spurred hard-to-shake stereotypes of \"ignorant\" and \"deviant\" mountain dwellers .\n\"Deliverance\" also generated huge tourism dollars for the northwest Georgia county .\nReal estate agent: \"Once people come to Rabun County, they don't want to leave\"","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Rabun County, Georgia, known for its beautiful landscape and white water, was put on the map by the 1972 movie \"Deliverance\".

{"question":"(CNN) -- Rescue workers have located the downed Yemenia Airways plane's distress signals, but not its flight data recorders, France's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. Relatives of passengers on the doomed jet arrive at Marseille airport in southern France. The ministry clarified comments made earlier in the day by the ministry's junior minister for cooperation Alain Joyandet. He told CNN affiliate BFM TV that the \"black boxes\" -- the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder -- had been localized. \"The jet distress beacons were found, instead of the black boxes,\" the ministry later clarified. \"There could have been some confusion.\" The Airbus 310 went down early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members on a flight that originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. The jet took off from Sanaa at 9:45 p.m. Monday and vanished from radar when it was about 16 miles from Comoros' capital, Moroni. The French navy and Yemeni authorities expanded search efforts for wreckage and bodies Wednesday, with a French frigate among the ships joining the search.

The other thing was that the sea was very rough when the plane approached landing at Moroni airport.\" But French Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau noted that France banned the Yemenia Airbus A310-300 several years ago because of safety concerns. \"People are talking about poor weather conditions, but for the moment, we are unsure,\" Bussereau said. \"It seems the plane may have attempted an approach, put on the gas, and attempted another approach, which then failed. For the moment, we must be careful, because none of this information is verified.\" Qadir said it was too early to blame the aircraft for the crash. \"This plane is just like any other plane,\" he said. \"It can have a malfunction, but we don't know what really happened before the investigation is over. And then we can determine if there is a technical issue, bad weather or anything else that may have led to the crash.\" It is the second crash involving an Airbus jet in a month.

{"question":"Washington (CNN) -- The once ragtag Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate group known as Al-Shabaab has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash every year from a variety of schemes involving extortion, illegal taxation and other \"fees,\" according to a United Nations report. The United States believes the group is closely coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and may be plotting attacks in the region and abroad. The terrorist group now \"generates between $70 million and $100 million per year, from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports, taxes on goods and services, taxes in kind on domestic produce, 'jihad contributions,' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation,\" according to the July 18 report from the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. The group has a long history of hindering humanitarian aid deliveries to millions suffering from drought and famine. In recent months, the U.S. military and the CIA have stepped up covert operations inside Somalia in an effort to counter the growing Al-Shabaab capabilities. One U.S. official says there are now estimates that Al-Shabaab controls up to 1,000 fighters in the country. He declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the information. \"I would say that the greatest risks right now in East Africa are Al-Shabaab and the violent extremists that they represent,\" says General Carter Ham, commander of the U.S. Africa Command. Speaking to his own troops recently, Ham said: \"Even if you don't think the humanitarian need is compelling enough ... to me there is a security angle to this which affords us an opportunity as a nation, as a collective group of nations, to really take an effort to undermine what Al-Shabaab is trying to do in Somalia.\" The Al-Shabaab organization \"presents an increasingly acute regional and international threat,\" according to the U.N. report. The monitoring group says despite infighting and some military defeats, \"the economic health of Al-Shabaab is more robust than ever.\" Funds are being used to pay for fighters, weapons and ammunition and continued fighting against the fragile Somalia security forces and African Union troops in the country. \"Al-Shabaab is evolving from an armed faction into a lucrative consortium of business interests, both within Somalia and abroad, whose members benefit from cartel-style trading practices, tax breaks and mutual facilitation. Moreover, there are indications that Al-Shabaab trading networks may also be used to camouflage charitable contributions from sympathizers in the Gulf States,\" the report reads. Al-Shabaab's economic growth has emerged largely since October 2009 when it won control of the southern port town of Kismaayo and other nearby ports. The group now generates an estimated $35 million to $50 million a year from port revenues. Another $30 million to $60 million a year comes from \"taxes\" on businessmen operating in marketplaces in the capitol of Mogadishu and other towns. \"In addition to those taxes on businesses, Al-Shabaab operates a comprehensive web of mobile military checkpoints where transportation operators and passengers are all obliged to pay taxes for free passage,\" the report reads. The U.N. report offers extensive details on Al-Shabaab's arms smuggling operations, as well as what the U.N. says are credible reports of potentially illegal arms shipments coming in by air and sea into southern Somalia and then being shipped to fighters throughout the country. \"During the Ramadan offensive in August and September 2010, for instance, several lorry loads of arms and ammunition arrived in Mogadishu just days after a consignment of weapons reportedly landed at Kismaayo airport,\" it reads.

Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals issued the recall at the retail level November 9, directing pharmacies not to dispense contaminated lots of the drug, but gave no directions to patients who have the drug at home. It's made for a confusing situation for patients taking Ranbaxy's atorvastatin, the generic form of Lipitor. Cholesterol drug recalled over glass concerns . \"Patients are sandwiched between two groups who are being less than helpful: the FDA and Ranbaxy,\" said Lisa Gill, editor of prescription drugs at Consumer Reports. A Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman couldn't explain why the recall didn't direct consumers to stop taking the drug even though patients might have received the contaminated pills. The spokeswoman, Sarah Clark-Lynn, referred questions about the recall to Ranbaxy, which issued a one-paragraph statement on its website and did not return phone calls and e-mails from CNN. The statement said that \"select batches\" of the medicine may contain \"small glass particles approximately less than 1mm in size\" and that the recall was being conducted \"out of an abundance of caution.\" It did not give consumers guidance about what to do with supplies of the drug at home. \"In my recent memory, there has never been anything like this,\" Gill said. \"It makes my palms sweat just thinking about it.\" Advice to patients . Between 3 million and 4 million people take Ranbaxy's atorvastatin, according to Ross Muken, senior managing director at ISI Group. The company has over a 40% share of the generic Lipitor market. One major pharmacy, Express Scripts, is telling patients it will not exchange Ranbaxy atorvastatin for another brand, according to Brian Henry, vice president of corporate communications for Express Scripts. \"Ranbaxy, in conjunction with the FDA, has determined there are no safety concerns associated with continued use of atorvastatin in the patients' possession,\" a recorded message tells consumers who call Express Scripts. Pharmacists at several CVS pharmacies said it was all right to keep taking already-filled prescriptions of Ranbaxy atorvastatin, but the company would exchange it for another brand at a customer's request.

{"question":"(CNN) -- British police were told in March this year that missing girl Madeleine McCann may have been kidnapped by a pedophile ring which followed her three days before her abduction, according to reports. Madeleine McCann went missing in May 2007 after being left at a holiday apartment in the Algarve region. Britain's Daily Telegraph and The Sun newspapers both reported Thursday that an email released this week as part of the documents compiled by the Portuguese investigators probing Madeleine's disappearance revealed the connection to the ring. Madeleine was 3 when she disappeared May 3, 2007, while she was on holiday with her family at the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz. Her disappearance prompted headlines worldwide. According to the newspapers, the email was sent on March 4 by a London-based Metropolitan Police intelligence officer to Leicestershire police -- Madeleine's home county -- who then forwarded it on to investigators in Portugal more than a month later. In the email, which both newspapers printed a copy of, the officer writes that \"intelligence suggests that a pedophile ring in Belgium made an order for a young girl three days before Madeleine McCann was taken. \"Somebody connected to this group saw Maddie, took a photograph of her and sent it to Belgium. The purchaser agreed the girl was suitable and Maddie was taken,\" the officer wrote. The Daily Telegraph reported the Portuguese police then asked Interpol to investigate. However, nothing appears to have come of the lead.  Watch how Madeleine McCann may have been abducted to order \u00bb . Belgium has already featured in the case, with a reported sighting on the Dutch\/Belgian border last August already discounted. The case files, released by the Portuguese investigators this week after they shelved the investigation for lack of evidence last month, have provided a raft of leads for the media to report. On Tuesday, the documents revealed a previously undisclosed sighting of Madeleine in the Netherlands shortly after her disappearance. The possible sighting of Madeleine in May 2007 stemmed from a report by a Dutch shopkeeper, who told authorities she encountered a little girl in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. She said the child identified herself as Maddie and said she was taken from her mother while on holiday. \"I start to ask where her mommy was,\" Anna Stam said. \"She couldn't tell me that. I wanted to give her a balloon, but she didn't want that. She only wants her mommy, she said. And she said that these people took her from her mommy.\" At one point, authorities had named the girl's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, as \"arguidos,\" or suspects, along with a British man living in Portugal, Robert Murat. But a spokesman for the Portuguese public prosecutor's office said authorities found no evidence of involvement by any of the three and were no longer considering them \"arguidos.\" After closing the case, police turned their case file -- containing up to 30,000 pages -- over to attorneys and private investigators working for the McCanns. The McCanns have vowed to keep searching for their daughter. .","target":"Portuguese police case file reveal more leads in Madeleine McCann disappearance .\nEmail from British police suggests Madeleine taken by pedophile ring .\nRing followed three-year-old girl before snatching her, reports claim .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"In March, British police received information suggesting that Madeleine McCann, who went missing in May 2007 from a holiday apartment in Portugal, may have been kidnapped by a pedophile ring.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Brazilian striker Brandao has been handed a one-month jail sentence for headbutting an opposing player, with the severity of his punishment linked to the footballer's role model status, according to one of the lawyers involved in the case. The judicial punishment follows a six-month sporting ban given to Brandao, who plays for French Ligue 1 side Bastia, following the August incident when he assaulted Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta. \"This is an extremely severe sentence compared to the criminal record of my client,\" Brandao's lawyer Olivier Martin told CNN affiliate BFMTV after the three-judge panel's ruling, which also included a $25,000 fine. \"It's all the more severe because of the motivation that was raised by the President of the Court to justify the sentence,\" added Martin. \"He referred to the violence in football stadiums.\" Brandao headbutted the Italy international in the tunnel of PSG' s Parc des Princes stadium following the match which the Parisian club won 2-0. The 34-year-old can be seen on CCTV waiting around before striking Motta and then running off out of shot with Brazilian-born Motta following in hot pursuit. Motta's lawyer Francois Klein said \"the court wanted to mark the occasion,\" as Ligue 1 players were considered role models to many people. \"Because these images are widely circulated; it gives the youth an absolutely regrettable idea,\" said Klein. \"It's well known that in many stadiums, suburban or elsewhere, there are similar events that may occur, and it is necessary that professional players lead by example.\" Neither of the two players involved were present at the Paris court for the trial. The court was particularly annoyed by the absence of Brandao, who was having surgery in a Saint Etienne hospital Thursday. Brandao is expected to \"benefit from a sentence adjustment,\" meaning he would serve his punishment through a community service rather than in jail. Against PSG, Brandao was playing in only his second match for the Corsica-based club after joining from Saint Etienne in the summer. He was initially suspended for four weeks following the attack which broke Motta's nose. Last season, he was banned for three matches for elbowing another PSG player, Yohan Cabaye, in the head. \"Brandao will be available to play again on Feb. 22, 2015,\" the French league's disciplinary committee said in a statement following his September punishment, meaning the striker will miss 24 league matches in total.","target":"Brazilian striker Brandao given one-month jail sentence .\nBastia forward's punishment likely to be community service .\nBrandao punished for headbutting Paris Saint-Germain's Thiago Motta .\nMotta's lawyer says severity of punishment linked to Brandao's role model status .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Brazilian footballer Brandao, who plays for French Ligue 1 side Bastia, has been given a one-month jail sentence for headbutting Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta.

{"question":"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Jazz musician Wynton Marsalis knows how important education is for youth, but what feeds their minds and souls, he says, often lies beyond traditional classroom walls. Musician Wynton Marsalis co-founded Jazz at Lincoln Center to broaden and inspire jazz audiences. \"The most essential thing for the development of kids and their understanding of the world are those things they do that's not school-related -- just any extracurricular activity,\" the Pulitzer Prize winner said. \"When you have activities you learn at a young age, you can do whatever you put your mind to!\" Marsalis, 47, co-founded Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York. As part of its goal to inspire and cultivate jazz audiences, Jazz at Lincoln Center sponsors youth events including an annual nationwide high school jazz band competition and festival, a Band Director's Academy and a popular concert series for kids. \"Jazz helps younger kids, especially, to connect with their innermost feelings and learn that [there's] nothing wrong with being real,\" Marsalis said. To Marsalis, jazz performer and instructor Davey Yarborough does just that. Yarborough provides Washington youth the opportunity and guidance to nurture their musical talents, not only as an educator at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts but also at his nonprofit jazz arts institute. Marsalis met Yarborough in the 1980s during one of his performance trips to the nation's capital and was struck by Yarborough's dedication to the students. \"I will see him at events, concerts. ... He always has kids with him,\" Marsalis said. \"He teaches all of his kids with the same intensity and feeling, and gives them that same feeling of specialness. It's something that can't be contrived.\"  Watch Marsalis describe how Yarborough inspires young people \u00bb . Yarborough, 55, says his motivation and inspiration stems, in part, from tragedy. After the 1988 death of one of his Duke Ellington students, Anthony Nash, in a drug trafficking incident, Yarborough decided to create a program geared toward music enrichment and mentorship during off-school hours. \"To have an element of the street take a student that was so bright and so promising was a trigger for me,\" Yarborough recalled. \"I knew all the students [as] family, and I want to know what's going on as much as I can with the students I am working with.\" Yarborough established a free summer-school music program at Duke Ellington to provide his students with a \"safe space\" where they could develop their skills. But when some school music programs in his district were cut, Yarborough noticed that many other students who had a desire to learn an instrument no longer had an opportunity to play or nurture their talent. \"The realization that I could only cater to the students at Ellington spurred the idea of 'OK, we need to take this into the community,' \" Yarborough said. After obtaining donated space in his local D.C. church, Yarborough and his wife, jazz vocalist Esther Williams, created the nonprofit Washington Jazz Arts Institute. Designed to serve those students who were \"left out\" by the school system or \"left behind\" by competitive Duke Ellington auditions, Yarborough says, the institute provides young local musicians with free jazz instruction, lectures, professional workshops and paid performance opportunities. They also have a mentoring system of professional artists. \"I wanted to really be able to see the students develop,\" Yarborough said. \"Once a young person decides they want to be a musician, such as I did in the third grade, they have a support system that takes them all the way through their career.\" Since its inception in 1998, more than 1,000 students have taken free music enrichment classes at the Washington Jazz Arts Institute. \"He loves those students,\" Marsalis said. \"There's no question that his kids have a much greater appreciation of jazz, but larger than [that], they have an appreciation of other people and of humanity and what we can all do if we invest in each other. They learn [that] from being in his presence.\"","target":"Wynton Marsalis co-founded Jazz at Lincoln Center to cultivate, inspire audiences .\nHis hero, Davey Yarborough's nonprofit jazz arts institute is a safe haven for youth .\nIt provides free lessons, lectures and paid performance opportunities .\nMarsalis: The nonprofit gives kids an appreciation of other people and humanity .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Jazz musician Wynton Marsalis emphasizes the importance of extracurricular activities in youth development, particularly music.

{"question":"London (CNN) -- A storm of outrage provoked by photos of Pippa Middleton showing her in a car with a man wielding what appears to be a gun in France should act as a wake-up call, royal watchers have warned Prince William's sister-in-law. \"This story is very damaging for her,\" veteran London-based public relations expert Max Clifford told CNN. \"There has been nothing but a honeymoon for Pippa since last year's royal wedding so this is dreadful,\" Clifford said. \"It comes particularly at a time when guns in Paris are such a sensitive issue. The reality is she could have been shot by police.\" Middleton has been a target for tabloid newspapers and paparazzi since her sister married Prince William last April. Shortly after the wedding, personal pictures of the 28-year-old began to leak out to the press, including a photo showing her in a bikini while on vacation in 2006 with her sister and Prince William. A photo of Middleton sunbathing topless on that trip was also made public. Later, undated photos from a private party showing her dancing in her bra were also leaked. The latest incident happened as paparazzi were taking pictures of Middleton who was being driven to a Paris train station in an Audi convertible. The car's driver wielded a gun, apparently pointing it in the air and then at a photographer, who was following them and captured the shot, according to The Sun. It is unclear if the gun was real or fake. Lawyers told CNN that Middleton was unlikely to face charges unless it could be proved she encouraged the driver to point the gun on public streets, but the driver could face charges of threatening with a firearm if French authorities wanted to do so. Middleton is the sister of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, who married Prince William last year. William is second in line to the British throne behind his father, Prince Charles. Buckingham Palace said it would not comment on the photo because Middleton is not a member of the royal family. The photo is causing a stir, after a spate of gun violence in France recently, including a series of attacks last month that killed seven people, including three children. The incident took place while security was heightened ahead of France's presidential election. \"Pippa must understand she's in the middle of a media spotlight and she can't just turn the attention on and off,\" Clifford added. \"I assume she has PR advice but either she's getting incredibly bad advice or she's not listening.\" The story has been splashed across newspapers around the world, and on Tuesday royal experts warned that Middleton must avoid further incidents for risk of damaging the royal family. \"Pippa is surprised at how high-profile she now is,\" one royal newspaper correspondent, who has met Middleton on several occasions, told CNN. \"Part of her enjoys the attention: she's always mixed with high-society characters and she loves partying but she's not off the rails by any means. \"This prank in a Paris street will come as a real wake-up call for Pippa,\" the correspondent, who declined to be named, told CNN. \"She must now realize that it just takes one person waving a gun around to seriously dent her public image. She'll be gutted by how badly this has reflected on the royals.\" But the correspondent said he believed Paris authorities would have no choice but to investigate the incident, while Middleton would be forced to issue a public apology. The photographer who snapped the shot was \"considering his options\" about a formal police complaint, The Sun reported. The Daily Express's royal correspondent Richard Palmer commented that ever since Middleton became last year's most celebrated bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister Kate to Prince William, she has been \"riding the crest of a wave of popularity. Some think she has also been riding for a fall.\" Palmer said Middleton was popular at high-society events, but she and her friends needed \"to learn how to behave in front of the cameras in return.\" The incident \"will have embarrassed her sister Kate, her brother-in-law Prince William, and also the Queen in her Diamond Jubilee year.\" \"She needs to explain herself and apologize.\"","target":"Storm of outrage over photos of Pippa Middleton in car with man apparently wielding gun .\nRoyal watchers say incident should act as a wake-up call to Prince William's sister-in-law .\nPhoto is causing a stir, after a spate of gun violence in France recently .\nRoyal experts say Middleton must avoid further incidents for risk of damaging royal family .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Pippa Middleton, sister-in-law to Prince William, has sparked outrage after being photographed in a car with a man brandishing what appears to be a gun.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Sarah Shourd, one of three American hikers held in Iran for more than a year, will be released Saturday, Iranian officials said Thursday. An official at Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance said earlier Thursday that one of the three would be freed this weekend, after the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, without specifying which one. But Bak Sahraei, a representative for the Iranian mission to the United Nations, told CNN that Shourd was designated for release \"very soon.\" The Culture Ministry official said one of Iran's vice presidents will be present when the hiker is released at 9 a.m. Saturday. Shourd, along with Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, were detained July 31, 2009, after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while hiking in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Tehran has said the three hikers were spies, and Iran's intelligence minister has hinted the country may consider releasing them in exchange for the release of Iranian prisoners, according to state news outlets. Masoud Shafii, the Iranian lawyer who represents the hikers, said he has put in a formal request for the trio's release within the past two weeks. Shafii said he told prosecutors that a year had passed since their arrests and the government had not shown any just cause for their imprisonment, and that Shourd has a medical condition that requires proper care. After the news first broke Thursday, the mothers of all three said they had seen the reports and were \"urgently seeking further information.\" \"We hope and pray that the reports are true and that this signals the end of all three of our children's long and difficult detention,\" Cindy Hickey, Nora Shourd and Laura Fattal said in a joint statement. \"Shane, Sarah and Josh are all innocent and we continue to call for their immediate release, so that they can return home together and be reunited with our families.\" Upon release, Shourd would be leaving her fiance behind in prison. The families  announced in spring that Shourd and Bauer got engaged in prison and plan to be married when they're both released. In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters, \"We don't know, frankly, what Iran is contemplating at this point.\" He said the United States was making inquiries through the Swiss government, which represents U.S. interests in Tehran. \"Obviously, if this turns out to be true, this is terrific news,\" Toner said. \"The hikers' release is long overdue, and I would just stress that we hope that it's all three hikers.\" CNN's Shirzad Borzorgmehr, Joe Vaccarello, Reza Sayah and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","target":"NEW: Jailed hiker Sarah Shourd to be freed \"very soon,\" Iran says .\nIranian official says release is scheduled for Saturday morning .\nHikers' mothers say all three are innocent and should be released .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Sarah Shourd, one of three American hikers detained in Iran for over a year, is set to be released on Saturday, according to Iranian officials.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Drug cartels, whether in Colombia or Mexico, cannot function without massive assistance from compromised officials at all levels. Corruption is the oxygen that keeps organized crime alive. I know something about corruption and organized crime. I spent more than six years in the biggest, richest syndicate in the history of crime -- the Cali cartel. And I know that Mexico, like Colombia, can't succeed against its drug gangs without choking off much of the bribery and intimidation that sustain them. First, some background: I used to be Jorge Salcedo. I left my name in Colombia when I entered the U.S. witness protection program 16 years ago. I also left a home, a country, friends, family, even my past. But maybe my experience will help show the importance of fighting corruption as a way to fight the cartels. My primary job in the Cali cartel was security for one of four godfathers, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, the daily operations boss. Others were more directly involved in routine bribery, but I still managed to deliver nearly a million dollars in payoffs. And I witnessed many, many millions more. The biggest bribe I ever handled personally was a half-million-dollar payoff to a Salvadoran air force colonel. I was buying four U.S.-made bombs -- 500-pounders -- that the bosses wanted to drop on Pablo Escobar. It was a very bad idea, but they sent me anyway. The cash was disguised as a birthday present, about the size of a large shoebox, wrapped in red paper with gold trim. I'd never seen so much money. I remember that it was surprisingly heavy. Then there were the two checks signed by Miguel worth about $50,000. As instructed, I took those to a bank near the Cali airport and deposited one into the account of a sister and the other to the mother of a captain in the Colombian anti-narcotics task force. It was a bonus for the captain's help getting the boss away from a police raid. In those days, hundreds of high-ranking and lower level police were on the cartel's secret payroll -- tens of thousands of dollars paid every month for inside tips or for looking the other way. The youngest boss, Pacho Herrera, sometimes liked to use local police as sentries at his home. The cartel had important friends in the military, too -- from helicopter pilots to generals. One well-placed insider was the sergeant and chief of staff to the military commander of the anti-narcotics task force. He cost $20,000 a month. Between sources like the army sergeant, the police captain and others, my bosses and I were kept informed about dates, times and places for raids and such things as which cartel cars were being followed and what phone numbers were being tapped. On one occasion, we knew that Miguel had time for lunch and a shower before the raiding party was scheduled to arrive. Both the sergeant and the captain were among hundreds of police and military officers fired for corruption. Besides law enforcement, the cartel bought a piece of Colombia's justice system with payoffs to prosecutors who lost evidence, misplaced paperwork, blocked search warrants or released prisoners before they could be questioned. Some judges became overnight millionaires. I see police and judicial corruption as the biggest price of organized crime. Politicians were considered a long-term investment. It seemed sometimes that they all had their hands out. The bosses handed out $20,000 checks like hospitality gifts. I was there when campaign officials for a presidential candidate came for help. Eventually, a total of $6 million in secret donations made Ernesto Samper our president. After top campaign aides acknowledged receiving cartel funds, Samper insisted that if such contributions were made, it was without his knowledge. And I was there when Cali cartel lawyers were allowed to rewrite our national constitution to outlaw extraditions of Colombian traffickers to the United States. You may be skeptical when I tell you, but no true Colombian could have watched that spectacle of democracy for sale without suffering some heartache. When I agreed to assist U.S. drug enforcement agents 16 years ago, the Cali cartel was making $7 billion a year. Cartel documents turned over to Colombian authorities exposed a vast network of corruption. There was public outrage. Widespread arrests and firings followed, and the grip of corruption was broken. That's what brought down the Cali cartel, and it can make a difference in other countries where a culture of acceptance makes corruption especially stubborn. The Mexican public needs to express its outrage. And, then, Mexican leaders need to sweep out officials at all levels who have sold their souls to organized crime.

{"question":"(CNN) -- For years, bloggers and other netizens have repeated: \"A link is not an endorsement.\" Now it appears that we have to add, \"a 'like, 'follow' or 'retweet' is not an endorsement, either.\" That's the only way to respond to the wave of breathless news stories and fancy web tools claiming to divine all kinds of correlations between Twitter buzz or Facebook followers and how the GOP presidential candidates will fare in the primaries. The worst of the new wave is The Washington Post's new MentionMachine tool \"that monitors Twitter and media across the Web for political candidate mentions, revealing trends and spikes that show where the conversation is and why.\" It claims that \"growth in the numbers of legitimate followers or a high recurrence of retweets are both indicative of growing grass-roots support.\" Groan. Actually, growth in followers or high numbers of retweets are just an indication of notoriety or celebrity. Saying simple, stupid things that lots of people want to tell their peers about can get you tons of followers and retweets. But it doesn't mean anything definitive about grass-roots support. Otherwise, right now we'd be talking about Herman Cain's amazing victory in Iowa.

But just because you can count something and chart it doesn't mean you've proven anything. Take, for example, Newt Gingrich's 1.4 million Twitter followers. On Huffington Post, Alan Rosenblatt demolishes the notion that this means he's popular among Republicans. Half of those accounts aren't in the United States. And half of all Twitter accounts aren't even active. Newt's numbers are a sign of online longevity and notoriety, not much more. Rick Santorum's late surge in Iowa should also put the mania for tracking online buzz into perspective. All of last year, he trailed the pack online. Meanwhile, he worked Iowa the old-fashioned way and did his best to tap into a social network that is more locally rooted than anything Facebook or Twitter has to offer. That is, the evangelical church. As the other candidates with a claim on that community started to fall away, Santorum's fortunes started to rise. And then in late December he got really lucky, sidestepping the negative attention and negative advertising that battered some of the other top-tier candidates while peaking at just the right time. Now the issue isn't how many new followers Santorum may get online, but how well he engages them and converts these low-level indications of interest into money, volunteers and votes. So far, the tidings aren't great. As my colleagues Sarah Lai Stirland and Nick Judd pointed out yesterday, Santorum's website wasn't quite up to the task of handling the burst of traffic he earned Tuesday night, potentially costing him millions in overnight donations. Nor does his site offer supporters a way to self-organize, the way My.BarackObama.com or MyMitt.com invites supporters to start their own profile pages or set up their own house parties and fundraisers. (And I haven't even mentioned the Santorum campaign's failure to successfully address his \"Google problem,\" which Search Engine Land's Danny Sullivan dissects at great length today.) Online politics is complicated and requires a level of technological literacy that most people, reporters included, simply lack. So as you encounter breathless headlines about the role of social media in the 2012 election, or how the race is going to be won or lost on Facebook or Twitter or whatever, just remember this: a link, or a follow, or a retweet, is about as meaningful as a glance or a nod. It's an indication of fairly low-level interest, nothing more. Organizing all those glances or nods into something powerful -- that's what really matters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Micah Sifry.","target":"Micah Sifry: Growth in followers and retweets are signs of low-level interest .\nCounting something and charting it doesn't mean you've proven anything, he says .\nSifry: Rick Santorum's surge should put the mania for buzz-tracking into perspective .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The article discusses the misconception that social media popularity, such as Twitter followers or Facebook likes, directly correlates with political success.

{"question":"NEW YORK (CNN) -- I like it when I'm right, especially about naked men. Especially about naked cowboys. A federal judge's opinion includes side-by-side photos of the key players in The Naked Cowboy case. When I wrote in April that the lawsuit filed by Robert Burck \"may be the end of the era of the \"naked\" cowboy and predicted he would be able to afford some \"very nice duds,\" my fellow lawyers laughed at me. One close friend -- let's call him Larry -- said as he snickered, \"I read your article. You can't be serious. You really think that the Naked Cowboy is going to cash in? Well, I predict he is going to get thrown out of court. If he doesn't, maybe I will start walking around my office in my tighty whities.\" Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Denny Chin didn't throw the cowboy from his steed. In fact, in a lengthy decision, Judge Chin ruled against the makers of M&Ms, rejecting Mars, Inc.'s attempt to dismiss the Cowboy's lawsuit. And it seems that Judge Chin has a sense of humor. On the first page of his decision, the judge pasted photos of the litigating parties side by side and wrote,  \"This is the case of The Naked Cowboy versus The Blue M&M.\" And what a case it is. Burck sued Mars in April for $6 million in federal court in New York. The central allegation: trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, arising from a video billboard for M&Ms. Most people, and maybe Mars, thought the Cowboy was just a kooky street entertainer dressed in his underwear. However, I've spoken to Mr. Cowboy, I mean, Mr. Burke, and he didn't seem kooky to me at all. In fact, he seemed kinda smart. Even Judge Chin recognized that The Naked Cowboy is no ordinary street entertainer. Although he performs in New York City's Times Square in little more than underwear and a smile, he has registered trademarks to \"The Naked Cowboy\" name and likeness. And he doesn't just sing in Times Square. He has a Web site http:\/\/www.nakedcowboy.com\/ with his modeling photos and has a link to nakedcowboy.tv. You can download his music on iTunes. You can buy his tighty whities from his online store for $15. He even has a podcast. Judge Chin observed that \"Burck has appeared as The Naked Cowboy in various television shows, movies, and video games. He has also licensed his name and likeness to companies for endorsements and advertisements. He even appeared in a Chevrolet commercial that aired during Super Bowl XLI. Judge Chin then explained that \"beginning in April 2007, Mars began running an animated cartoon advertisement on two oversized video billboards in Times Square, featuring a blue M&M dressed \"exactly like The Naked Cowboy,\" wearing only a white cowboy hat, cowboy boots, and underpants, and carrying a guitar.\" And get this -- the video \"played on a continuous loop every few minutes over a nine-month period.\" Mars tried to defend itself by arguing that the Blue M&M was just a parody of the Cowboy and was protected under the First Amendment. Although imitation is supposed to be the sincerest form of flattery, Judge Chin didn't agree with M&M's parody argument. Rather, Judge Chin thought it was a question for a jury to decide and wrote that the complaint \"plausibly argues that consumers would believe that the M&M Cowboy characters were promoting a product rather than merely parodying The Naked Cowboy, and that viewers would believe that The Naked Cowboy had endorsed M&Ms.\" Then Judge Chin ordered the lawyers to appear in his courtroom for a pretrial conference on July 11 at noon. High Noon. That Judge Chin makes me laugh. Round One to the Cowboy. Larry, maybe you should start walking around the office in your tighty whities.","target":"Federal judge rejects M&Ms maker's parody defense .\nHe notes that The Naked Cowboy, aka Robert Burck, registered his trademark .\nBurck is suing Mars Inc., the maker of M&Ms, for copyright infringement .\nCase involves guitar-slinging blue M&M in cowboy hat, white underpants .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Robert Burck, also known as The Naked Cowboy, sued Mars, Inc. for $6 million for trademark infringement under the Lanham Act.

{"question":"(CNN) -- American golfer Webb Simpson expects a close battle with world No. 1 Luke Donald this week as both seek to top the PGA Tour's end-of-season money list for the first time. Both will line up in Florida for the final event of the U.S. circuit's Fall Series, with $846,000 on offer for the winner from a total prize purse of $4.7 million. Donald had been in pole position in his bid to become the first golfer to top both the U.S. and European money lists in the same season, but Simpson went $363,029 clear in the PGA standings despite suffering a playoff defeat to fellow American Ben Crane at the McGladrey Classic on Sunday. Englishman Donald, who went to a friend's wedding instead, will now need to finish second or higher at the Children's Miracle Network Classic at Disney World starting on Thursday to usurp Simpson. Simpson has won $6.2 million so far from 25 events, while Donald is on almost $5.84 million from 18. The 26-year-old Simpson is seeking to cap an incredible breakthrough year in which he won his first title at Wyndham Championship in his home state of North Carolina in August, then triumphed in the second event of the FedEx Cup playoffs and narrowly missed out on the $10 million jackpot when he faded to 22nd at the Tour Championship. \"I think coming in, finishing second is going to make it a lot harder for Luke,\" world No. 12 Simpson told the PGA Tour's official website. \"But I'm sure he's going to play well. He's played well most every week this year. I still wouldn't be surprised if I have a little work to do next week. \"It would be nice to run away with it, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's going to be pretty close. Winning would take care of a lot, I think.\" Crane said his form over Sunday's final round was \"as good as I can play\" after claiming his fourth title. The new world No. 50 carded eight birdies in the final 11 holes to finish on 15 under par, before Simpson bogeyed at the second additional hole to hand Crane victory. \"Is that right?\" Crane said when he heard the statistics from his impressive round. \"What the heck? Wow. That's as good as I can play. \"I just said, 'Well, if I'm going to have a chance, I'm going to have to birdie two of the last three holes.' \"Newsflash: If you don't birdie the first one and you're dormie with two holes to play and you've got to make two birdies, it gets harder. I read it perfectly and the ball went right in the middle and I was just thrilled.\" Despite the win, his first since the Farmers Insurance Open in January 2010, Crane had little time to celebrate, with his wife Heather due to give birth to their third child on Monday. \"I told my wife, 'I don't even know if I should -- what am I doing here? You're about to go into labor ... Should I even be playing this week?' \" he said . \"I was driving, bringing the car down after the playoff was over, and someone said, 'Well, you've got to name the baby -- the baby's middle name has got to be McGladrey or Frederica ... Sea Island.'\" American Michael Thompson mised out on the playoff by one shot as he finished third ahead of 2010 British Open winner Louis Oosthuizen. Oosthuizen's fellow South African and 2008 Masters champion Trevor Immelman was fifth on 12 under, two shots clear of a five-way tie for sixth place which included two-time major winner Angel Cabrera. Jim Furyk, the 2003 U.S. Open champion who topped the PGA Tour money list in 2010, tied for 11th on nine under.","target":"Webb Simpson moves ahead of world No. 1 Luke Donald on PGA Tour money list .\nAmerican loses to Ben Crane in playoff at McGladrey Classic on Sunday .\nDonald trying to be first man to top PGA and European Tour money lists in same year .\nEnglishman will now need to finish second or higher at final Fall Series event .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"American golfer Webb Simpson is set to compete with world No. 1 Luke Donald for the top spot on the PGA Tour's end-of-season money list.

{"question":"Washington (CNN) -- Ten Mexican nationals have been charged with last year's killings of three Americans connected to the U.S. Consulate in Juarez, Mexico, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced Wednesday. The 10 are among 35 members of the international gang Barrio Azteca charged with various counts of racketeering, murder, drug offenses, money laundering and obstruction of justice, Holder said. \"Twelve of these defendants were arrested just this morning by teams of United States federal, state and local authorities in Texas and in New Mexico,\" Holder announced at a Justice Department news conference. U.S. Consulate employee Leslie Ann Enriquez Catton; her husband, Arthur Redelfs; and Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, the husband of another U.S. Consulate employee, were killed last March 13. Justice officials do not have a motive in the shootings, but they haven't ruled out a case of mistaken identity. Seven of the 10 defendants charged with the consulate killings are in custody in Mexico, U.S. authorities said. \"The indictment unsealed today represents our continued action to ensure safety along our Southwest border, to seek justice for victims of violent crime in this region, and to weaken dangerous criminal organizations currently operating in Mexico and the United States,\" said Holder. \"These arrests and criminal charges will disrupt Barrio Azteca's current operations, and they reaffirm that we will not tolerate acts of violence against those who serve and protect American citizens. We will continue to stand with our partners in Mexico, and together, build on our unprecedented joint efforts to combat violence and protect the safety of the American and the Mexican people.\" Justice officials say Barrio Azteca, which began in the late 1980s as a violent prison gang and expanded into a transnational criminal organization, is a highly organized and brutal gang. \"Barrio Azteca gang members are cold blooded criminals who show no respect for the law or justice, murdering innocent victims, trafficking drugs and inciting violence,\" said DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart. \"The fight is not over, we are in this for the long haul. We will continue to use every tool at our disposal to hold accountable violent criminal organizations and gangs that have been terrorizing border communities,\" said Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division. \"This is at times a gruesome battle, but make no mistake, we will not stop and we are not going away,\" Breuer added. Holder said the Justice Department is working on extradition proceedings for the seven charged in the consulate killings and already in custody.","target":"A U.S. consulate employee and two others were killed in Mexico last year .\nTen Mexican nationals have been charged and seven are already in custody .\nThe 10 are among 35 members of the Barrio Azteca gang charged with various offenses .\nU.S. authorities announced the indictments Wednesday .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Ten Mexican nationals, part of the international gang Barrio Azteca, have been charged with the 2020 killings of three Americans linked to the U.S. Consulate in Juarez, Mexico, according to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Will Michael Jackson stop the world? Fans have set up impromptu shrines to Michael Jackson, including this one at his family's house. Thousands are expected to swamp Los Angeles, California, to mourn him Tuesday at the Staples Center, and the accompanying media crush will be enormous. The tribute to the King of Pop at Harlem's Apollo Theater earlier this week drew coverage from all over the world, along with a public turnout in the thousands. Given the feverish interest in all things Jackson, the Los Angeles memorial could be one of the most-viewed events of all time. \"This will obviously be a huge media event, and with Web streams of the funeral, it may be impossible to say for sure how many people watched once all is said and done, because there's still no comprehensive way to measure Web viewing,\" said Toni Fitzgerald, of Media Life, in an e-mail interview. A handful of events have earned the kind of worldwide coverage to put the world on pause, if only for a moment. The 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy \"had the nation locked in a trance for two or three days,\" recalled TV critic Ed Bark of UncleBarky.com. The world audience for the Apollo 11 moon landing has been estimated in the hundreds of millions. The BBC estimated 2.5 billion people watched the 1997 funeral of Princess Diana.   Watch Jermaine Jackson talk about his brother's legacy \u00bb . The numbers are easily exaggerated -- nobody knows how many people are watching in groups or in public places -- and the Web has complicated matters further. But in a multichannel, satellite TV, computer-and-cell phone world, the Jackson memorial could have an audience in the hundreds of millions. It was first believed the event would take place at Jackson's Neverland Ranch. But the family announced Thursday that it will hold a private ceremony Tuesday, and then a massive public memorial service at the Staples Center. Fans had until 6 p.m. Saturday to register for free tickets to the memorial service. Organizers used a computer to choose 8,750 names from 1.6 million who registered since Friday.   Watch a tour of Neverland \u00bb . \"You have to go back to the Beatles, the death of John Lennon perhaps, and the death of Elvis Presley to find a comparable figure in, not just pop music, but pop culture,\" said Entertainment Weekly critic-at-large Ken Tucker. (EW, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) \"And Jackson so self-consciously turned himself into not just an American pop icon but a global pop icon. I think this does have worldwide implications and interest.\"  See how interest in Jackson's music has skyrocketed \u00bb . The circumstances of Jackson's death have led to  comparisons with Presley's in 1977, but in terms of coverage, the two can't compare. The news wasn't even the top story on CBS' \"Evening News,\" Bark recalled, and there certainly wasn't wall-to-wall nationwide live coverage of his funeral. A public viewing drew about 30,000 fans; the funeral, two days after his death, was held in Graceland's living room. But Bark said there are parallels, at least in terms of coverage, with the Kennedy assassination. \"These days it's so much harder to get a bulk audience on any given venue the way the [broadcast networks] did back then, but still the enormity [of the event] -- it's the syndicated tabloid shows ... and TMZ and all the cable networks devoting lots of attention to it, [and] the broadcast networks can't seem to do enough specials in prime time,\" said Bark. \"I do think it's comparative but in a very different way.\" Officially, the sorts of events that have attracted the largest mass audiences have been scheduled entertainment or sports programs. Sixty percent of America watched the 1983 \"M*A*S*H\" finale; more than half watched the 1980 \"Who Shot J.R.\" episode of \"Dallas\" and the 1977 \"Roots\" conclusion. The Beatles' first appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in 1964 drew about 45 percent of the country. The Super Bowl is routinely the year's most watched program, with audiences north of 80 million -- about 40 percent of U.S. television households. Although interest in Jackson has been high, the number of viewing choices (and, perhaps, the traditional decline in summer viewing) has kept the ratings for individual Jackson-oriented shows down. \"Jackson's death came up in just about every conversation I had from Thursday to Sunday, and yet only 5 million people tuned in to some of those broadcast specials,\" Media Life magazine's Fitzgerald observed. Still, the public memorial service might be different. \"I expect you'll see very big tune-ins on the cable news networks and on BET, if they cover it; they had huge numbers for their BET Awards focused on Jackson over the weekend,\" Fitzgerald said. The BET Awards was watched by 10.7 million, the most ever for a cable awards show. \"With the celebrity factor thrown into the funeral, who'll be there, who'll talk, I would guess tens of millions in the U.S. will watch it on TV,\" she said. It is certain is that the news media will be there in force. \"I guess we're all going to wait and see what the spectacle is,\" Bark said. \"There may be no precedent for this.\"","target":"Public memorial Tuesday could be one of the most-viewed events of all time .\nIt could have a television and online audience in the hundreds of millions .\nJackson's death has led to comparisons with Elvis Presley's death .\nOthers see parallels, at least in terms of coverage, with the Kennedy assassination .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The memorial for Michael Jackson in Los Angeles could be one of the most viewed events of all time, with fans from around the world expected to attend and a significant media presence.

Carney said that President Barack Obama and the Martin family have called for a non-violent reaction to the verdict. \n  \n \u201cSo, they\u2019re on their own?\u201d Finger followed up. \n  \n \u201cYou can editorialize all you want, and I\u2019m sure that you will, but that is a ridiculous statement,\u201d Carney shot back. \n  \n The reaction to the question the political press to l\u2019affaire de intern was swift and remorseless: \n  \n In fairness, a handful of members of the political press congratulated Finger on his success at sneaking a question in during the press briefing, but those exceptions merely prove the rule. \n  \n This contempt the reporters and commentators above displayed probably inspired a series of high fives and \u201cattaboys\u201d from some of their colleagues but, from outside The Bubble, the appearance of media elites bristling over gall of an intern for merely asking a question of a government official is not a good look. \n  \n Update: Daily Caller co-founders Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel released a statement addressing the controversy surrounding \u201cIntern-Gate\u201d: \n  \n Some reporters in Washington are asking why The Daily Caller sent our intern Gabe Finger to the White House press briefing this afternoon.

{"question":"(CNN) -- A line of widely scattered strong storms brought tornadoes to Colorado and Minnesota on Thursday and damaging high winds as far south as Texas. Three tornadoes stuck Minnesota. One hit near rural St. James. Kholby Martin, a storm chaser with KDR Media, said it was a couple of hundred yards wide but it wasn't fully condensed. Officials said no one was hurt, nor was there any structural damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Colorado. There was still a possibility of tornadoes in south central Minnesota and central Iowa on Thursday night. Dallas County in Texas saw an hourlong tornado warning Thursday afternoon as the system moved through, bringing winds of up to 70 mph, the National Weather Service said. Students at Southern Methodist University were told to shelter in place. That was followed by a flash flood warning for several counties in the area through the early evening hours. CNN affiliate WFAA reported that five boys were rescued from a creek after fast-moving waters moved in. Emergency responders found the boys clinging to whatever they could find along the shore, the station said. There was wind damage around the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. In one neighborhood in west Dallas, residents told WFAA that when the storm hit they saw debris flying through the air and heard transformers popping. Deborah Drake came home to find the glass in an entrance door to her home shattered by some of that debris. \"You just heard this noise (like a train whistle) then it just shook the house,\" said a neighbor who was helping her clean up broken glass. \"I ran in the bathroom and got in the bathtub.\" Some areas of South Dakota near Harrisburg were pelted by quarter-size hail, according to the National Weather Service in Sioux Falls. Winds were blowing as fast as 50 mph. On Friday, strong storms will probably strike from Arkansas to Indiana, with rain in the Midwest, South and Northeast as the system moves east. That blustery, wet weather could affect as many as 14 million people, CNN meteorologist Sherri Pugh said. Saturday should bring more rain for those areas, too. Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, will also get wet as 1 to 3 inches of rain is forecast. The area has been dealing with recent heavy rains, so the risk is high in those areas for flash flooding, and there's been a flash flood watch issued. Tired of reading about rain?

{"question":"One of the most high-profile women accused of connections with Mexico's drug trade was extradited to the United States Thursday, officials said. Mexican police handed over Sandra Avila Beltran, known as \"The Queen of the Pacific,\" to U.S. marshals at an airport in central Mexico Thursday morning, Mexico's Attorney General's Office said in a statement. She will face cocaine trafficking charges in a federal court in Florida, prosecutors said. 14 bodies found in Mexico . Avila was once a key drug trafficking link between Colombia and Mexico, prosecutors have said. She was arrested in Mexico City on September 28, 2007, smiling before cameras as authorities trumpeted her detention. Since then, her life has been the subject of a best-selling book and a popular ballad. \"The more beautiful the rose, the sharper the thorns,\" says one line in \"The Queen of Queens,\" Los Tigres del Norte's song describing Avila. Her eye-catching nickname has regularly made headlines as Mexico's case against her made its way through the nation's courts. A judge convicted her on money laundering charges, but ruled that Mexican prosecutors didn't provide enough evidence to convict her of drug trafficking. In 2011, authorities in Mexico City said they were investigating a tip that prison medical personnel had allowed a doctor to give Avila a Botox injection. Avila denied that accusation, Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency reported. For more than two years, Avila has tried to block a U.S. extradition request. A Mexican judge ruled that she could be extradited in June. A 2008 U.S. Congressional Research Service report described Avila as \"a senior member of the Sinaloa cartel who was instrumental\" in building ties with Colombian traffickers. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Avila was suspected of conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States along with Juan Diego Espinosa, a Colombian national who was also known as \"The Tiger.\" 4 Mexican military officials accused of organized crime ties . The DEA said that in November 2001, Espinosa, Avila and others \"allegedly arranged the shipment of cocaine from Colombia to the United States by ship.\" The ship, loaded with 9,291 kilograms of cocaine, was boarded by U.S. agents near Manzanillo, on Mexico's Pacific coast. U.S. authorities extradited Espinosa from Mexico in 2008. A judge sentenced him to six years in prison after he pleaded guilty to a cocaine distribution conspiracy charge in 2009. A court document signed as part of the plea agreement said that he and Avila had taken part in a deal to distribute 100 kilograms of cocaine in Chicago. In the United States, Avila faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if she is convicted of charges of conspiracy to import and sell cocaine, according to a 2004 indictment filed in U.S. district court. In a 2009 interview with Anderson Cooper that aired on \"60 Minutes\" and CNN, Avila denied the charges against her, and blamed Mexico's government for allowing drug trafficking to flourish. \"In Mexico there's a lot of corruption, A lot. Large shipments of drugs can come into the Mexican ports or airports without the authorities knowing about it. It's obvious and logical. The government has to be involved in everything that is corrupt,\" she said.","target":"The so-called \"Queen of the Pacific\" faces cocaine trafficking charges .\nAuthorities have said she was a key link between Mexican and Colombian cartels .\nHer life is the subject of a ballad and a best-selling book .\nIn 2011, accusations surfaced that she received a Botox treatment in prison .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Sandra Avila Beltran, known as \"The Queen of the Pacific,\" was extradited from Mexico to the United States to face cocaine trafficking charges.

Program Overview . Home loans gone bad are wrecking the U.S. economy. CNN teams up with Fortune Magazine's Andy Serwer to investigate how the housing boom went bust. The fallout begins on Wall Street, where billions of dollars in American mortgages were bought, bundled and sold around the world. CNN takes the high-stakes mortgage game to Delmonico's, a Wall Street institution since 1837, where the likes of J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie once wheeled and dealed. Host Andy Serwer plays dealer and invites a few experts to face off on the mortgage crisis. Guest players include New York Times columnist and Princeton economist Paul Krugman, CNN's Personal Finance Editor Gerri Willis, securities guru Janet Tavakoli, investment strategist Peter Dunay and mortgage broker Jon Shibley. Grade Levels: 11-12, College . Subject Areas: Business, Economics, Finance, Social Studies, Life Skills . Objectives: . The CNN Special Investigations Unit Classroom Edition: Busted! Mortgage Meltdown and its corresponding discussion questions and activity challenge students to: . Curriculum Connections . Economics America National Standards . Standard 10 : Role of Economic Institutions . Students will understand that: Institutions evolve in market economies to help individuals and groups accomplish their goals. Banks, labor unions, corporations, legal systems, and not-for-profit organizations are examples of important institutions. A different kind of institution, clearly defined and enforced property rights, is essential to a market economy. Standard 16 : Role of Government . Students will understand that: There is an economic role for government in a market economy whenever the benefits of a government policy outweigh its costs. Governments often provide for national defense, address environmental concerns, define and protect property rights, and attempt to make markets more competitive. Most government policies also redistribute income. The Economics America National Standards (http:\/\/www.ncee.net\/ea\/standards\/) are published by the National Council on Economic Education (http:\/\/www.ncee.net\/). Social Studies . Standard V.

Discussion Questions . Suggested Activity . Point out to students that one of the best ways for them to prepare for homeownership is to arm themselves with knowledge, and that the purpose of this activity is to help them obtain this information. Group students and instruct each group to prepare a PowerPoint presentation on the top ten things that first-time homebuyers should know before they shop for a mortgage. Groups may want to include information that addresses these points: . Have groups deliver their presentations to the class. If possible, invite a realtor or mortgage broker to attend the presentations and discuss the guidelines that are used to determine whether or not a homebuyer can afford a home. Extension . Following the presentations, direct students to print and online resources to identify homes that are for sale in their community, as well as the current interest rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage, a 15-year fixed mortgage and a 5\/1 ARM. Next, have each student select a house and use an online amortization schedule calculator to determine what the monthly payment (principle + interest) would be for each type of loan, assuming that the loan was for 80% of the purchase price of the home. Instruct students to identify the potential benefits and drawbacks of each type of loan, and to select the loan type that they feel would be the best choice for the homebuyer. Then, have each student determine the salary that he or she thinks a person would need to earn to afford the monthly mortgage payments. After students share their research, ask: .

There have been several kidnappings of Christian clergymen in Syria but the two bishops are the most senior church figures who have been abducted since the beginning of the uprising. The Syrian regime's Ministry of Religious Endowment issued a statement blaming \"this brutal act\" on Chechen mercenaries operating under the mantle of Jabhat al-Nusra and al-Qaeda. The government did not provide evidence to back up the claim. A spokesman for the Free Syrian Army said the government itself could be behind the kidnappings. \"The timing is very suspicious and we believe the Assad regime is behind the kidnapping,\" Louay Almokdad told CNN. Another opposition figure, Rami Abdurrahman of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, elaborated, saying they believe that non-Arab foreign fighters are behind the kidnappings. \"We know that there are foreign fighters who are infiltrated by the regime and the Assad regime is well known for being a ventriloquist of proxy groups that they set up in order to spread chaos, strife and to divide the ranks of the opposition,\" he said. CNN cannot independently confirm the claims by either side. Earlier, there were conflicting reports about the status of the bishops. \"The bishops were supposed to be released by the armed group yesterday evening; then we expected them to head back to their churches. But they didn't, so we are still carrying out all efforts to figure out what happened,\" Abdel Ahad Steifo, a prominent Syriac member of Syria's main opposition group, told CNN. Steifo, who is in charge of the negotiations for the release of the clergymen, says he does not know the identity of the kidnappers. But they are not part of the opposition, he said. In an interview with the Vatican's Fides News Agency, the Chaldean bishop of Aleppo, Antoine Audo, said that at the root of the \"scourge of kidnapping\" is not politics, but \"the pursuit of money on behalf of armed gangs.\" Recent incidents of clergymen being kidnapped ended with their release after ransoms of thousands of dollars were paid, he said. On Tuesday, the director of the Holy See press office, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said Pope Francis is closely following the events in Syria. The pope is \"praying for the health and the liberation of the two kidnapped bishops,\" Lombardi said. A number of Muslim clerics have also been killed and kidnapped in Syria, including a top Sunni cleric and longtime supporter of President Bashar al-Assad, Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Bouti, who was killed in a suspicious blast while teaching religious class in Damascus. Rebels and regime officials blamed each other for the assassination of al-Bouti.

{"question":"Doc to summarize:(CNN) -- \"Precious,\" a movie about a 1980s-era Harlem teen who strives to overcome abuse, neglect and illiteracy, pulled five Independent Spirit Award nominations Tuesday morning. Stars Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique were both recognized for their portrayals of a mother and daughter in a dysfunctional relationship, with a best female lead nomination for newcomer Sidibe and a best supporting female nomination for Mo'Nique. The film's success is not entirely a surprise, considering that the Oprah Winfrey- and Tyler Perry-backed Sundance darling has earned $27 million at the domestic box office and was received well by audiences during its slow rollout in cities across the nation in November. Sidibe's work in \"Precious\" has been one of the breakout roles of the year, and the young actress is rumored to be the star of a new series, \"The C Word.\" However, it hasn't been all smooth for \"Precious\": The film earned zero nominations for the Gotham Independent Film Awards, which were given out Monday night. The Gotham awards are a New York-based indie film honor. \"The Hurt Locker,\" by contrast, took home two Gotham awards Monday night, one for best picture and the other for best ensemble. There were no Independent Spirit Award nominations for this Iraq war drama, however, as it was nominated last year. For the Spirits, \"Precious\" is facing off against the Zooey Deschanel-driven \"(500) Days of Summer,\" \"Amreeka,\" \"The Last Station\" and \"Sin Nombre\" for best picture. \"Summer\" also snagged a nomination for best male lead, a nod for Joseph Gordon-Levitt. On top of the best picture nomination, \"The Last Station\" -- a biographical piece about Leo Tolstoy featuring James McAvoy, Helen Mirren and Paul Giamatti -- is up for best director, best screenplay, best female lead and best supporting male lead. Christian McKay, another relatively unknown actor in the United States, has gotten lots of love from critics for his portrayal of Orson Welles in Richard Linklater's \"Me and Orson Welles,\" and the Spirit Awards noticed, giving the British actor a nomination for best supporting male performer. In order to be considered, all films had to be 70 minutes long with a budget under $20 million, and had to have screened at one of the major film festivals, such as Sundance or Toronto. The awards ceremony is typically held the Saturday before the Academy Awards, but since the Spirit Awards are celebrating their 25th anniversary in 2010, they're moving out from under Oscar's shadow and will air live on the Independent Film Channel on March 5.","target":"\"Precious\" and \"Last Station\" both lead Independent Spirit Award nominations .\nAcclaimed indie \"Hurt Locker\" didn't earn any nominations, as it was nominated last year .\n\"(500) Days of Summer\" is up for best picture, along with \"Amreeka,\" \"Sin Nombre\"","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The 1980s Harlem-based movie \"Precious\" has received five Independent Spirit Award nominations, including best female lead for Gabourey Sidibe and best supporting female for Mo'Nique.

{"question":"Tokyo (CNN) -- Hammered by a nuclear accident at its Fukushima Daiichi power plant, Tokyo Electric Power Co. on Friday reported a net loss of 1.2 trillion yen ($15.4 billion) for the fiscal year that ended March 31. Tokyo Electric also announced it will decommission reactors Nos. 1-4 at Fukushima Daiichi. It also has canceled plans to build two other reactors at the site. In addition to the company's earnings, Tokyo Electric president Masataka Shimizu announced his resignation Friday, which must be approved by the board of directors at a June meeting. \"The accident compromised our confidence in the safety of nuclear power,\" Shimizu said. \"We have caused problems and anxiety to the public.\" Managing Director Toshio Nishizawa has been tapped to replace the president. \"We are facing the gravest crisis in the history of the company,\" Nishizawa said. \"I feel the enormous gravity of the responsibility to assume the position of the president ... so I accepted the position.\" Vice Presidents Sakae Mutoh and Makio Fujiwara also tendered their resignations, as did Director Tomijirou Morita. A restructuring plan was announced to boost company finances and help create more than a trillion yen in savings by selling off real estate, cutting pay and reducing staff. The Fukushima Daiichi plant has faced a series of setbacks since a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami struck on March 11. The disasters triggered a glitch in the plant's cooling system, and caused radiation to leak. As crews work to bring the problems under control, the government said this week it would compensate more than 78,000 displaced by the nuclear disaster. Tokyo Electric has made a down payment on compensation of 1 million yen (about $12,000) per household to some families. Some analysts say total compensation could amount to more than 10 trillion yen ($124 billion). The government has set no ceiling on the compensation and Tokyo Electric will be required to pay back the money spent out of a government-backed fund. The shadow cast by Fukushima Daiichi has inflicted yet-unknown losses on farmers, fishermen and shopkeepers. And looming compensation costs have darkened the future of Tokyo Electric, a $157 billion company that could still be driven into some form of government receivership by the nuclear disaster.

Boehner quiets rebellion on right \n  \n A dust up among a major House conservative bloc and the prospect of tens of billions of dollars in new spending cuts has Republican leadership feeling as if it quelled an uprising on the right after struggling to line up votes for much of the week. \n  \n Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy of California and Chief Deputy Whip Peter Roskam of Illinois continued their hard sell of a two-step debt-limit package, meeting in Capitol offices to close the deal and avoid a default on the nation\u2019s $14.3 trillion debt. \n  \n Story Continued Below \n  \n In a closed-door Republican Conference meeting on Wednesday, Boehner demanded his wavering members \u201cget your ass in line\u201d to back his proposal, and some members obliged. Michigan Rep. Thad McCotter, who is running for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, switched from voting no to yes during the 90-minute session. Reps. Blake Farenthold of Texas, Billy Long of Missouri and Jeff Denham of California are now backing the speaker\u2019s plan, as are Reps. Darrell Issa of California, Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, Nan Hayworth of New York and Dan Lungren of California. Lungren even got up during the meeting and likened Boehner to Ronald Reagan, the conservative icon who was president during Lungren\u2019s first stint in the House. Other hard \u201cno\u201d voters have flipped to leaning no or even undecided. \n  \n But despite having momentum on their side, Boehner and his top lieutenants don\u2019t have a big margin for error. Few, if any, Democrats are expected to vote for the debt ceiling package, so Republicans must cobble together 217 votes on their own. They can lose just 23 lawmakers and still pass it. As of press time, at least a dozen lawmakers were whipping \u201cno.\u201d \n  \n Indiana Rep. Mike Pence \u2014 former House Republican Conference chairman who is running for governor \u2014 has emerged as a late-game player, of sorts, in the debt debate. Pence and a dozen undecided Republicans met with McCarthy on Wednesday afternoon with a new request designed to win their support for the Boehner plan \u2014 GOP leaders must hold a vote on a \u201cclean\u201d balanced-budget amendment similar to that passed by the chamber in 1995. If that happens, they may throw their support to the Boehner plan, said one of the lawmakers. \n  \n Pence\u2019s position is in contrast to earlier positions of the conservative Republican Study Committee, which he once chaired. The RSC has pushed a balanced-budget amendment that requires a supermajority to raise taxes. Pence\u2019s argument is that GOP leaders should launch a \u201cserious effort\u201d to pass a balanced-budget amendment as part of this debt deal by putting forth a bill that could garner Democratic votes. \n  \n \u201cI cannot vote to raise the debt ceiling if we don\u2019t do everything in our power to send a balanced-budget amendment to the Senate and the states,\u201d Pence said in an interview. \n  \n Wednesday also began some serious internal GOP drama involving the RSC and other Republican lawmakers. The RSC is now chaired by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan. \n  \n Wesley Goodman, an RSC aide, sent an email to a network of conservative activists opposed to the Boehner proposal \u2014 they don\u2019t think it cuts spending enough \u2014 on Tuesday saying now \u201cis the day to kill the Boehner deal.\u201d Goodman said that the RSC needs \u201cstatements coming up to the Hill every hour of the day in mounting opposition to the plan.\u201d |||||","target":"\u2013 The CBO report that forced John Boehner to delay the vote on his debt ceiling plan may end up working in his favor, reports the Hill.

The delay has given Boehner and Eric Cantor more time to twist arms, and the speaker reportedly told GOP lawmakers today to \"get your ass in line\" and support his plan. Boehner made the case that if it passed the House, it will clear the Senate, too, even though Harry Reid says otherwise. \u201cThis is the bill,\u201d Boehner told the closed-door meeting, according to Politico. \"I can\u2019t do this job unless you\u2019re behind me.\u201d In another bit of drama, Rep.

{"question":"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Like other major financial centers such as London, Shanghai or New York, Hong Kong is home to legions of suited workers toiling long hours in vast, glass towers at breakneck speed. But in this crowded, materialistic city, there's a man trying to build a business from de-stressing the workplace. \"The wellness of employees is the wellness of the company; the very strength of a company is its employees,\" said Dario Calvaruso, a yoga instructor who set up Holistic Wellness -- a company that offers a series of in-office programs to reduce stress.

When Calvaruso moved to Hong Kong in October 2011, opportunity knocked on his door. \"Many of my friends were major company managers and approached me for private (yoga) classes,\" Calvaruso said. \"After seeing its benefits they thought 'this should come to my company'.\" Within this territory's constricted work spaces, practicing yoga requires relatively little room and minimal equipment -- a large ball and a mat are enough. As the instructor plays calm music, everyone stretches, breathes deeply and closes their eyes. \"All the team is present at the lessons and it's a great way to start our day,\" said Manuele Bosetti, general manager of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macao. This organization has to deal with the day-to-day problems of its member companies and sometimes taking the time to listen can be a challenge, Bosetti told CNN. But performing yoga as a group has helped. \"We noticed that everyone at the office was more relaxed, and we managed to treat our business partners in a more kind way,\" Bosetti added. Suited and ready . The sight of practitioners in their work clothes surrounded by computers and other electronics may seem incongruous with relaxation and meditation, but Calvaruso believes yoga performed in his studio is similar to that done in corporate environments -- although people in the workplace may face unique problems. For example, students at a studio yoga class may practice over many years, while those in corporate settings may be unfamiliar with the discipline. \"In an office, maybe people don't know anything about yoga,\" Calvaruso told CNN. \"They may feel discomfort, frozen shoulders; we try to release all the tension from the shoulders to give them proper alignment.\" Desk ergonomics are another common focus for yoga classes in offices. And the result? \"Employees perform better, produce more, and of course, the company has bigger profits,\" Calvaruso said. Nevertheless, it can be difficult to inspire managers to interrupt their team's workday for a few minutes of relaxation. \"In Asia, (employee wellness) is still new, it's growing,\" said Calvaruso, who believes the region lags behind Europe and the United States when it comes to measures that actively help employees find a balance between work and leisure. This instructor's uphill battle goes against Asia's economic dynamism.

{"question":"(CNN) -- House Republican leaders announced Thursday they will not take action on a new farm bill until after the November elections -- a sign of sharp internal GOP divisions on a critical political issue for many members of Congress. \"We will deal with the farm bill after the election,\" said Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. \"The current situation that we face is we've got people who believe there's not enough reform in the farm bill that came out of (the House Agriculture) committee, (and) we've got others who believe that there's too much reform in the bill that came out of the committee.\" Boehner indicated GOP leaders do not believe they currently have the votes to pass either a short-term extension or a more comprehensive five-year measure. The current five-year law establishing various levels of federal support for farmers and ranchers -- now struggling with drought in many parts of the country -- expires September 30. A failure to pass a new law won't impact existing federal support in 2012, though it would have a significant impact on agricultural markets in 2013, according to Dale Moore, a public policy deputy at the American Farm Bureau Federation. While the Democratic-run Senate passed a comprehensive $969 billion replacement bill in June through a rare bipartisan 64-35 vote, numerous conservatives in the Republican-controlled House have balked at the overall price tag and rising cost of food stamps included in the measure. Several Farm Belt Republicans in tight political races this year, however, have pushed hard for quick legislative action on a five-year plan. North Dakota Rep. Rick Berg, a freshman House Republican running for retiring Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad's seat, told CNN Thursday he was \"frustrated with the Republican leadership.\" \"We have to get a five-year, long-term bill passed. I'm really disappointed,\" he said. \"Agriculture is one of our bright shining spots in America right now, and we don't need to put this cloud of uncertainty over it.\" Berg argued that GOP leaders should have allowed a full House vote on the Agriculture Committee measure. The committee's bill has a number of similarities to the Senate plan. Asked about the farm bill's legislative prospects in the post-election lame duck session of Congress, Berg said, \"I look back over history and this is more normal than not. ... I'm just doing everything I can do.\" Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson, the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee, told CNN there were \"10 different reasons\" why the House has so far failed to act. \"Some people think the food stamps are too high. Some people don't like the sugar program. Some people don't like the dairy program. Some people don't like the farm bill at all,\" he said. Peterson said he believes farm bill advocates will ultimately \"get a shot\" after the election. \"I think they're taking a (political) risk,\" he said in reference to the House Republicans. \"But they apparently don't think it's a problem.\" Moore told CNN that \"we can whine and complain all we want, but the bottom line is this segment of the game is over.

{"question":"Less than a year ago, Mark Driscoll, an evangelical pastor, was flying high. His hometown Seattle Seahawks were in the Super Bowl, and the brash pastor scored a big, faith-fueled interview with five of the team's top players, including quarterback Russell Wilson. But in a remarkably fast fall from grace, Driscoll resigned Tuesday as pastor of Mars Hill Church, a congregation he founded 18 years ago and turned into a force in the mostly secular Pacific Northwest. In a statement, Mars Hills' board of overseers said Driscoll hadn't committed any acts of \"immorality, illegality or heresy\" -- sins that have felled many a powerful pastor. Instead, the board said, Driscoll is guilty of \"arrogance, responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech, and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner.\" Driscoll was not asked to leave, the board added, saying they were \"surprised\" to receive his resignation letter. In that letter, obtained by Religion News Service, Driscoll says: \"Recent months have proven unhealthy for our family -- even physically unsafe at times -- and we believe the time has now come for the elders to choose new pastoral leadership for Mars Hill.\" The 43-year-old pastor acknowledged that, \"There are many things I have confessed and repented of, privately and publicly, as you are well aware. Specifically, I have confessed to past pride, anger and a domineering spirit.\" Before his resignation, a number of Mars Hills leaders fled the church, saying that Driscoll was not fit for leadership. He has also been accused of plagiarism and using a complex scheme to pad book sales. The pastor has apologized and said \"mistakes were made.\" The broader beef with Driscoll, though, seemed to be his more-macho-than-thou approach to fellow Christians. According to Christianity Today, the pastor had trolled online discussion forums under the pseudonym \"William Wallace II,\" and lambasted the supposed rise of \"male lesbians;\" \"feman,\" (men who act like women, in his definition); and \"men who allow their wives to nag at them.\" \"While the discussion board itself was a bad idea,\" Driscoll said in a letter obtained by Christianity Today, \"my decision to attack critics who were posting there (I did so by posting under the character 'William Wallace II') was an even worse idea.\" Even before that revelation, Driscoll was highly controversial and almost comically outspoken. He once said that mainstream Christians had turned Jesus into a \"Richard Simmons, hippie, queer Christ,\" and a \"neutered and limp-wristed popular Sky Fairy of pop culture that ... would never talk about sin or send anyone to hell.\" In a book he wrote with his wife in 2012, Driscoll delved into serious detail about his sex life, leaving some reviewers, and almost as many Christians, a bit uncomfortable. For all that, though -- or maybe, because of all that --  Driscoll was pretty successful by many measures. He built Mars Hill into a mini-empire, with 15 satellite locations and even a couple of universities. His books and sermons were read and heard by millions. In his resignation letter, Driscoll hints that his pastoral career isn't dead yet. \"My journey, at age 43, is far from over,\" he writes, \"I believe (God) has brought me a long way from some days I am not very proud of, and is making me more like him every day.\"","target":"Evangelical resigns from Mars Hill Church, which he founded 18 years ago .\nMark Driscoll's congregation became force in mostly secular Pacific Northwest .\nChurch board said he was guilty of \"arrogance,\" \"quick temper,\" \"harsh speech\"","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Mark Driscoll, an evangelical pastor, resigned from Mars Hill Church, a congregation he founded 18 years ago.

{"question":"(CNN) -- The pictures of Tokuyoshi Takahashi's fish processing factory in northeastern Japan taken after March 11, 2011 illustrate just how destructive the tsunami was. A ship was swept on to land by the giant wave and left stranded against the front of the factory, while entire sections of wall collapsed, leaving twisted metal and debris protruding from inside. Takahashi estimated the catastrophe caused US$19 million worth of damage to his business, Takatoku , which processes fish for major supermarket chains across Japan. He was forced to lay off all of his 120 employees. \"I set a goal right after the quake,\" he said. \"All the staff would be back by January 1.\" iReport: Share your stories about last year's disaster . Three months after that deadline and he's almost there. Seventy are now back at work and he expects that number to rise to 100 by March. Though he's found many of his old employees, some have left the city all together to find work elsewhere. Takahashi is one of a small group of businessman determined to rebuild Ishinomaki, a city of around 150,000 on the coast of northeastern Japan. The tsunami caused widespread damage here, knocking down homes and wiping out the fishing port and processing factories that account for 30% of the jobs in the city. With no jobs and no homes, many have left for bigger cities like Sendai or Tokyo. The survival of the fishing industry here is deeply intertwined with that of the city itself. A year on and progress has been slow. Kunio Suno, president of the Ishinomaki Fish Market is one of city's most determined champions, spearheading the effort to create a newer and better port. He says fishing volumes are still at just a fifth of what they were before March 11, and fisherman have nowhere to sell their catch without the processing plants. His biggest frustration is with the pace of the recovery. The national government insists on following the normal -- but lengthy -- approval process for the rebuilding plans, rather than fast-tracking proposals as an emergency case. \"There is a huge gap between our feelings and those of Tokyo,\" he said. Only two weeks ago Ishinomaki's local government announced plans to rebuild the fishing industry at a cost US$1.5 billion, including support for small and medium fish processing plants. It will take three year to complete. Suno's vision for the fish market is even more ambitious. He wants to expand beyond the commercial auction and add restaurants to attract tourists, like similar sites in Sydney and Seattle. As for the processing plants, Takahashi believes only two of his competitors are back in full operation. He says others have struggled to raise capital or to rebuild the land under their factories, which sunk a meter in the disaster. His hope is that Ishinomaki can attract investors to the rebuilding process so that people can be convinced to move back. For Suno, convincing people to stay and work in Ishinomaki is about more than saving the city he's lived in for twenty years. It is less about money and more about saving a way of life. \"If this industry is gone, people will have to go to Tokyo and they will be without a true home,\" he said.","target":"Ishinomaki was just one of many Japanese towns hit hard by last year's earthquake and tsunami .\nTokuyoshi Takahashi was forced to lay off the 120 staff at his fish processing factory .\nBut Takahashi is one of a small group of businessman determined to rebuild the city of 150,000 .\nThey are trying to attract investment in rebuilding to lure back residents who left the town .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The 2011 tsunami in Japan caused significant damage to the city of Ishinomaki, particularly impacting the fishing industry which accounts for 30% of the city's jobs.

However, he has since been able to rehire 70 workers and expects to employ 100 by March. The city's recovery has been slow, with fishing volumes still at a fifth of pre-tsunami levels. The national government's lengthy approval process for rebuilding plans has been a source of frustration. Recently, Ishinomaki's local government announced a $1.5 billion plan to rebuild the fishing industry, including support for small and medium fish processing plants. The plan, expected to take three years, also includes expanding the fish market to attract tourists.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Jim Foglesong, a famed Nashville music executive and producer who played a key role in launching the careers of such notables as Garth Brooks, George Strait and Suzy Bogguss, has died. He was 90. His death on Tuesday morning was confirmed by a statement from Vanderbilt University's Blair School of Music, where Foglesong taught for more than 20 years. \"Jim was a grand gentleman with a marvelously generous spirit,\" said Mark Wait, dean of the school. \"He had a great ear for music of every kind, and he gave freely of his expertise to countless students and young professionals.\" Foglesong's career spanned more than a half-century and included stints as a performer, producer, record company president and industry eminence. \"Jim was one of the first people I met when I came to Nashville,\" recalled George Strait in a statement to CNN. \"I would wish that for every newcomer. His kind and gentle demeanor is rare today. He signed me to my first record deal, and his support and friendship was something I treasured. We will all miss you, old friend.\" The onetime vocalist -- who \"worked in a bank and sang in a Baptist church and a Jewish temple to pay for rent, food, and voice lessons,\" according to his biography on the Country Music Hall of Fame's website -- eventually worked under Arturo Toscanini, produced recordings by Julie Andrews, oversaw a variety of labels and helped make hits of songs by Barbara Mandrell, Freddy Fender, the Oak Ridge Boys, Merle Haggard and Reba McEntire. He was one of the people who helped launch Epic Records in the 1950s, then and now one of Columbia's primary labels. After stints at Epic, RCA, Dot and MCA, Foglesong joined Capitol Records' Nashville division. It was there he helped guide Brooks, who released his first album in 1989 and became country music's best-selling artist of all time. \"Today, the music industry lost its greatest diplomat for kindness, tolerance, faith, and sincerity,\" said Brooks in an e-mailed statement. \"But do not weep for Jim, I have never met a man with a stronger faith, anyone who knew Jim knows where he is now. Instead, weep for those of us who are left here without him ... truly, a great, great man.\" After leaving Capitol, Foglesong became an educator. A statement from the Blair School notes that his \"Business of Music\" course, a weekly three-hour seminar, was one of the school's most popular offerings. He also oversaw the music business program at Nashville's Trevecca Nazarene University. Foglesong chaired the boards of directors of the Country Music Association and the Country Music Foundation, and was active in a variety of other local organizations.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Thierry Henry scored twice as Barcelona booked their place in the quarterfinals of the Champions League with a 5-2 second leg victory against Lyon at the Nou Camp. Lionel Messi, left, and Thierry Henry celebrate as Barcelona reach the last eight of the Champions League. Former winners Porto joined them at the next stage after their return leg against Atletico finished goalless in Lisbon -- the 2-2 draw in the first leg in Madrid sending them through on the away goals. Spain's Primera Liga leaders Barcelona strolled into a 4-0 first half lead on their way to a 6-3 aggregate success with Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o building on Henry's double. Jean Makoun pulled one back just before half-time and Juninho struck three minutes after the restart, but the French champions never looked like disturbing Barca's path to the March 20 draw. Lyon's hopes suffered another blow when Juninho was given his marching orders after picking up a second yellow card in time added on and Seydou Keita took full advantage by snatching another in the final seconds. Having conceded an away goal in a 1-1 draw in the first leg at the Stade Gerland, Lyon had to score to stand any chance of progressing. After a fairly even opening, a quickfire double from Henry dictated the outcome of the tie. After 25 minutes he latched onto a ball from Rafael Marquez, beating the offside trap to slide the ball under Hugo Lloris. Two minutes later Henry doubled the lead when he slid the ball in at the near post past the advancing Lloris. Messi showed his class in the 40th minute. The Argentina star collected the ball on the right touchline, before embarking on a mazy run past three Lyon defenders. He then exchanged a one-two with Eto'o, before firing a low shot home. Eto'o was desperate to get on the scoresheet himself as he stormed into the box from the left, only to see his shot saved by Lloris from point-blank range. Within a minute, though, he had made amends as he popped up in the box, side-stepped his marker and smashed the ball home. A minute from the break, Makoun made it 4-1 as he headed home Juninho's corner. And the former Brazil midfielder got on the scoresheet himself three minutes after the break following a cross from Cesar Delgado. Any thoughts of a comeback failed to materialise as Barca continued to create a raft of chances. As the game moved, into stoppage time, Juninho picked up a second booking for dissent and moments later Mali midfielder Keita made it five for Barca.","target":"Barcelona beat Lyon 5-2 in second leg to reach Champions League last eight .\nThierry Henry on target twice as Spain's Barcelona progress 6-3 on aggregate .\nPorto also through on away goals after goalless home leg against Atletico .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Barcelona secured their spot in the Champions League quarterfinals with a 5-2 victory over Lyon, thanks to two goals from Thierry Henry.

{"question":"(CNN) -- China's Shenzhou-9 spacecraft returned to Earth on Friday, completing an ambitious mission that notched up a series of breakthroughs for the country, including putting its first woman in orbit. Shenzhou-9 successfully carried out a manned space docking last week, making China the third country to complete such a feat after the United States and Russia. Hanging from a parachute, the capsule floated back down to Earth on Friday, bumping down on the arid terrain of Inner Mongolia and rolling onto its side. Support teams raced on foot and in vehicles to where the capsule lay to coordinate the three-person crew's exit from the spacecraft. After an hour of preparation work in and around the capsule, the crew members emerged one by one, smiling and waving. They were helped into chairs, as their bodies were still adapting to the earth's gravity after nearly two weeks of weightlessness. Jing Haipeng came out first to applause from the ground staff. He was followed by Liu Wang. There was then a pause before the female crew member, Liu Yang, made her way out. The three sat in a row in front of the capsule as Chinese flags rippled in the wind behind them. Still fully dressed in their spacesuits, they joined hands and were each handed a bouquet of flowers. China has made rapid, steady strides in developing its space program over the past decade, such as sending its first astronaut into space, completing its first spacewalk and launching two lunar orbiters. It has big aspirations for the program and hopes to build a space station and conduct a manned mission to the moon. Shenzhou-9 docked with the orbiting Tiangong-1 space laboratory last week. Tiangong-1, a prototype for a full-fledged space station, was launched into space in September. The crew of Shenzhou-9 followed that feat by executing a manual docking with Tiangong-1 on Sunday. Mastering the technique of joining spacecraft together manually is considered an crucial step toward China's goal of building a space station in 2020. Previously, the docking had been done by remote control from the ground. The endeavors have been a source of pride for China and coincided with the record-setting descent of a Chinese manned submersible vehicle 7,020 meters into the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean. They could help bolster support for the Chinese Communist Party as it undergoes a once-in-a-decade leadership transition later this year and deal with the fallout from the dramatic downfall of Bo Xilai, one of the country's most prominent politicians.

{"question":"(CNN) -- As you can imagine, college life can be very eventful. Balancing classes, internships, and a life away from home is enough to keep anyone busy. As a 20-year-old living with a chronic illness, I have skillfully learned the balancing act of college life. My name is Marquita Gaines, and I have sickle cell disease. I was first diagnosed at birth. The doctors performed a newborn screening test and when I was 10 days old they called to inform my mom. Because she and my father both have the sickle cell trait, she was aware that I may have the disease. At the age of 8 months I began having fevers over 101 consistently for a year. When I was 5 years old, I was riding the new bike I had just gotten for Christmas when I fell off and the handle bars hit me in the ribcage. That night I began having difficulty breathing. I was rushed to the local hospital and within hours I had stopped breathing. I was moved to intensive care, revived, and placed on a respirator. The critical care doctors and the hematologist worked day and night to figure out what was happening to me. My health continued to decline, and my parents were told to go pray because if I continued to not receive enough oxygen I would only have two hours to live. Around the seventh day, my condition stabilized and it was learned that I was suffering from an acute chest syndrome, a condition common among sickle cell patients. Shooting survivor says blood donations saved her life . Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder affecting the red blood cells. It causes the cells to lose oxygen very easily, turning them from round shapes to crescent shapes that cause painful episodes known as pain crises. At first glance, no one would know that I am a patient living with sickle cell disease. On any given day I can feel great, but I never know when the pain will come or how long it will last. A pain crisis can cause severe pain in my joints, my bones and my muscles. Sometimes it lasts for hours or even for days. At my worst it is difficult to walk and I have to use a wheelchair. To help reduce the number and severity of these episodes, I take daily medications and, with the help of the American Red Cross, I receive red blood cell transfusions every six weeks. The first time I received donor blood from the American Red Cross, I was in the 11th grade. I arrived on an outpatient basis, and a trained nurse from the American Red Cross came to administer the procedure. I was nervous, but the possibility of having little to no pain was exciting. First, my blood was typed and cross-matched with donor blood. Then, with my family by my side, the transfusion began. A machine filtered out my sickled red blood cells in exchange for roughly 10 pints of normal red blood cells. The American Red Cross nurse administering the transfusion was very knowledgeable and friendly, which helped me remain calm. Everything was a success, and within a week and a half I felt like a brand new person! My bones no longer ached and I was able to stop taking the heavy pain medication. Once my senior year began, I was able to attend school more often. I also was able to run the mile in eight minutes with the rest of the gym class -- and I wasn't the last person to finish! Cancer survivor's challenge: Give the gift of life this season . Now in my junior year at Howard University, I am still managing school work and my illness. I am involved in campus life as a member of student government and other organizations. I am young and full of life, with many goals and aspirations. The American Red Cross provides the opportunity for me to feel better more often. Transfusions allow me to have an easier, pain-free life. During this holiday season, my hope is that everyone will realize the importance of being a blood donor. For people like me who need regular transfusions, blood is often best matched among people of the same ethnic group, so donations from anyone who is a minority or has a rare blood type such as U- or Fy(a-b-) are especially important. You could help someone like me live a healthier, happier, pain-free life. I am a testament to the importance of blood donation and the services that the American Red Cross provides on a daily basis. Without both I wouldn't be able to be a happy and successful young lady. I realize that sickle cell disease is a part of me, but it will never define who I am. With treatments like this and a strong support system, which I have from my family and the American Red Cross, there is no excuse not to succeed with this disease.

{"question":"(CNN) -- The British tabloid News of the World hacked Kate Middleton's phone while she was dating Prince William, a prosecutor told a London court Thursday in a trial of the defunct newspaper's executives, according to the British Press Association. In one voicemail message that William left Kate -- the transcript of which was read in court by the prosecutor -- the prince calls his future wife \"Babykins\" and says he was almost shot by blank rounds during a military training exercise, the PA reported. The date of the message wasn't immediately clear, though the couple weren't yet married at the time, the PA reported. Middleton became the Duchess of Cambridge when she married William in April 2011. The transcript, dug up during a police investigation into the newspaper's alleged hacking practices, was one of several messages between the couple that were read at London's Old Bailey court, the PA reported. The revelation came at the trial of former News of the World editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson and the paper's former managing editor, Stuart Kuttner. All are accused of conspiring between October 2000 and August 2006 \"to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority.\" They deny the charges. Glenn Mulcaire, a former private investigator for News International -- the then parent company of News of the World -- was convicted of phone hacking in 2006 and has already pleaded guilty to hacking charges in the current case.

{"question":"New York (CNN) -- The first time I held a premature baby was nearly two decades ago during medical school. The baby weighed just 3 pounds, and I remember being so afraid I might drop her. While I stared into her eyes, it gave me goose bumps. The parents hadn't yet given her a name because they worried she wouldn't survive. The neonatal ICU (NICU) nurses were truly remarkable, taking care of these preemies, and making it all seem so effortless. I do remember the most anxiety-provoking times surrounded the transport of these babies. Even if it was just one floor away, there was a plan laid out with clear communication and a defined role for the half a dozen NICU nurses who would accompany the baby. There was a commander of the transport, and several contingencies for worst-case scenarios. I remember asking one of the nurses, \"What is the safest way to transport this baby?\" Her reply: \"In the womb.\" She was right, and if you consider the number of risks to a premature baby, you understand why. The heart rate of tiny babies can suddenly drop, and they can even develop a complete heart block. They require oxygen, but not too much because they are at risk of oxygen toxicity to their lungs. They can barely regulate their temperature, and they have a larger body surface area to mass ratio, which makes the problem even worse. They can lose fluids rapidly, and they don't yet have glycogen stores in their liver. So, not getting a timely meal could prove fatal. Imagine any of these things happening outside of the ICU, and now compound that by 100. That is what took place Monday night at NYU's Langone Medical Center. As you watch the video of these babies being rushed through the streets of New York, you now have a better idea of just how involved all of this really was. At about 10:30 p.m. Monday, with generators failing and widespread internal flooding, hospital staff called the CEO of Mount Sinai, Dr. Kenneth Davis, and asked for help. He immediately approved the transfer of 64 patients, including three mothers in labor and seven newborn babies. One of them was Emma, just 13 days old and weighing only 2 pounds. Emma's parents were in New Jersey, watching in horror as they learned the hospital was being evacuated. Shortly thereafter, they lost power and had no way of driving back into the city of Manhattan. As a parent myself, that part of their story really got to me the most. They were completely in the dark, stranded and helpless. I met Emma just a few hours after she arrived at Mount Sinai. She was in the NICU, and was perfectly stable. There were lots of tears of joy in the hospital, as families were reunited for the first time. Resilient, was how one of the nurses described little Emma. Still gives me goose bumps.","target":"Transporting premature babies can be anxiety-provoking, Gupta says .\nTheir medical needs make them especially fragile .\nEmma was among patients evacuated from NYU Langone Medical Center .\nGupta says meeting Emma, who is stable, gave him goose bumps .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The article recounts the author's experience as a medical student with premature babies in the neonatal ICU (NICU) and the challenges faced during their transport due to their fragile health.

{"question":"(CNN) -- A gang rape allegedly involving the teenage son of a famous Chinese \"singing general\" has caused outrage in China, unleashing a tide of public anger over the behavior of so-called \"princelings,\" the children of elite families. Li Tianyi, 17, stood before Haidian People's Court in a closed hearing in Beijing Wednesday and Thursday, one of five defendants accused of raping a woman in a hotel room in February after drinking with her in a bar. Li, who also goes by the name Li Guanfeng, told the court he was drunk and could remember little of the night in question, but denied beating or having sex with the woman, the state-run Beijing News reported. While Li's four co-accused issued guilty pleas by the trial's end, Li continued to deny the allegations, state media reported. Li is the baby-faced son of 74-year-old Li Shuangjiang, a celebrity singer for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and dean of music at the PLA Academy of Arts, who became a household name for his renditions of patriotic anthems on television. The teen's mother, Meng Ge, is also a well-known PLA singer, and attended court to support her son. Li has previously made headlines for running afoul of the law. In 2011, aged 15, he was arrested after attacking a family in a road rage accident. Li, who was driving a BMW with no license plates, angrily confronted the occupants of a vehicle blocking his way, threatening bystanders and daring them to call police. Explore: China's new leaders . He had previously racked up 36 traffic violations while driving without a license, according to media reports, triggering an outcry when the incident was reported. He was subsequently sent to a juvenile detention center for a year, and his father issued a public apology. Tian Canjun, lawyer for the alleged victim in the rape case, said his client had been hospitalized due to stress and would not be attending the trial, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Lawyers for the accused have argued in pre-trial hearings that the woman was a prostitute, and the matter should be tried as a prostitution matter, rather than a rape case. The trial has caused a sensation in China, focusing public attention once again on the excessive lifestyles of China's rich and powerful and their families, who are widely seen as entitled and corrupt. It comes hot on the heels of the sensational trial of former Communist Party kingpin Bo Xilai, which offered a lurid snapshot of alleged corruption among China's political aristocracy. Chinese social media users have been scathing of Li, who has become one of the most infamous examples of a \"taizidang,\" or \"princeling.\" \"This just demonstrates that the elite class is above the law in China,\" wrote a user called @woshixiaojuanmao_loving on the popular Chinese micro-blogging service Sina Weibo. Read more: Privileged kids anger Chinese public . \"Meng Ge has totally failed in educating and nurturing her son,\" wrote another, using the handle @ingyunyixiuge777. \"This case gives us a glimpse of the corruption in China, and the government should punish the criminal severely to sound a warning to others.\" In July, hackers attacked the website of one of Li's lawyers, leaving a message stating: \"We just want to return justice to the client.\" Public opinion has been mounting against the princelings since an incident in 2010, when the drunk-driving 22-year-old son of a deputy provincial police chief fatally ran over a student and shouted: \"Sue me if you dare! My father is Li Gang!\" The phrase has since become synonymous with nepotism and corruption in China. Recognizing the threat posed by the popular discontent over the issue, President Xi Jinping has made a priority of stamping out abuses by officials, with a high-profile anti-corruption campaign that has toppled senior figures including the former railways minister and a top economic planning official. He has recently focused his attention on the PLA's musicians, many of whom have celebrity status. On Monday, he publicly rebuked PLA musicians following a series of embarrassing reports detailing their privileged lifestyles and exposing incidents of commercial exploitation of their positions. The dressing down was accompanied by new measures, signed off by Xi and detailed in the PLA Daily, the official organ of China's armed forces, designed to curb the excesses of military musical troupes. Xi's wife, the noted soprano Peng Liyuan, herself served in a PLA performance troupe. Prosecutors said the gang rape accused who are juveniles -- four of the five on trial are aged under 18 -- should receive lesser punishments due to their youth, and that the defendant who helped authorities build their case against his co-accused should have his sentence further diminished, Xinhua reported. It said the court would issue its verdict on the case in due course.

{"question":"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The suspected cyberattack that struck South Korean banks and media companies this week didn't originate from a Chinese IP address, South Korean officials said Friday, contradicting their previous claim. The Korea Communications Commission, a South Korean regulator, said that after \"detailed analysis,\" the IP address that was thought to be from China was determined to be an internal IP address from one of the banks that was infected by the malicious code. It said, though, that \"the government has confirmed that the attack was from a foreign land.\" An IP address is the number that identifies a network or device on the Internet. Widespread damage . The attack Wednesday damaged 32,000 computers and servers at media and financial companies, South Korea's Communications Commission said. It infected banks' and broadcasters' computer networks with a malicious program, or malware, that slowed or shut down systems, officials and the semiofficial Yonhap News Agency said. The military stepped up its cyberdefense efforts in response to the widespread outages, which hit nine companies, Yonhap reported, citing the National Police Agency. Government computer networks did not seem to be affected, Yonhap cited the National Computing and Information Agency as saying. A joint team from government, the military and private industry was responding. How the hackers got in and spread the malicious code remains under investigation, and analysts are examining the malware, a South Korean official close to the investigation said. Blaming North Korea in the past . South Korea has accused the North of similar hacking attacks before, including incidents in 2010 and 2012 that also targeted banks and media organizations. The North rejected the allegations. The outages come amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with the North angrily responding to a recent U.N. Security Council vote to impose tougher sanctions on Pyongyang after the country's latest nuclear test last month. Last week, North Korea invalidated its 60-year-old armistice with the South. It has threatened to attack its neighbor with nuclear weapons and has also threatened the United States. The armistice agreement, signed in 1953, ended the three-year war between North and South but left the two nations technically in a state of war. The United States has deployed B-52 bombers to conduct high-profile flyovers of its South Korean ally and announced that it will deploy new ground-based missile interceptors on its West Coast against the remote possibility that North Korea could strike the United States with long-range weapons.","target":"Wednesday's suspected cyberattack hit 32,000 computers .\nNine companies fell victim to the malicious code .\nGovernment computers weren't affected .\nSouth Korea has blamed the North in the past, which has rejected the allegations .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"South Korean officials have retracted their previous claim that a cyberattack on their banks and media companies originated from a Chinese IP address.

{"question":"(CNN) -- \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" has found its new leading man in Jamie Dornan, according to the author of the best-selling trilogy. \"Stow your twitchy palms ladies ... our man is here. Welcome to #TeamFifty @JamieDornan1,\" writer E.L. James said in a Twitter post on Thursday. The author's revelation comes after industry trades like The Hollywood Reporter and Variety cited sources saying the 31-year-old actor has been tapped to replace Charlie Hunnam, the \"Sons of Anarchy\" actor who was originally cast as Christian Grey and dropped out in mid-October. So far, Universal Studios and the actor's representatives haven't commented on the reports. Dornan's name may not be that familiar to American audiences, but his face might be. The star, who was born in Northern Ireland, got his start as a model for brands like Dior, Armani and Calvin Klein and posed alongside top names like Kate Moss. Jamie Dornan: Who is he? Before he landed acting roles on U.S. shows like ABC's \"Once Upon A Time,\" on which he played the Huntsman\/Sheriff Graham, Dornan was known mainly to U.S. celebrity watchers as the guy dating fellow Brit Keira Knightley. In the UK, he stars in the BBC's psychological thriller \"The Fall.\" While Dornan had been considered the front-runner after Hunnam's exit, his wasn't the only name said to be in consideration. The actor reportedly had competition from British actor Christian Cooke, \"The Borgias'\" Francois Arnaud and \"True Blood\" star Alexander Skarsgard. Hunnam, meanwhile, is looking forward to family time. Charlie Hunnam speaks on '50 Shades' exit . \"I am doing good (after dropping 'Fifty Shades'),\" the 33-year-old recently told E! News. \"Just trying to stay focused and stay positive and keep trying to do a good job at work and be with my family.\" Hunnam was faced with an onslaught of attention, both positive and negative, after his casting announcement, sparking speculation that he exited the part because of the overwhelming amount of interest. However, studio Universal said Hunnam's TV schedule didn't give him time to adequately prepare to play Christian Grey. Production was expected to begin on the film, adapted from E.L. James' erotic best-seller and to be directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, in early November. The studio has already announced a scheduled release date of August 1, 2014. Although the project has weathered this casting challenge, its leading lady hasn't gone anywhere. Dakota Johnson, the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson who has starred in the TV series \"Ben and Kate,\" is still on board to play protagonist Anastasia Steele. CNN's Carolyn Sung and Henry Hanks contributed to this report.","target":"NEW: \"Fifty Shades\" author confirms: Jamie Dornan has been cast as Christian Grey .\nThe 31-year-old is known for modeling for Calvin Klein .\nHe has also appeared in ABC's \"Once Upon A Time\"\n\"Fifty Shades\" is expected to arrive on August 1, 2014 .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Jamie Dornan has been announced as the new lead for \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" by the author of the trilogy, E.L.

{"question":"Attorneys and a federal judge are expected to meet in a North Carolina courtroom Friday afternoon for a status hearing regarding the pending criminal trial of John Edwards, the former presidential candidate and U.S. senator. The hearing comes after attorneys on both sides filed several motions, many of them sealed from the public. In December, attorneys for Edwards asked again to delay his criminal trial, saying Edwards had an unspecified medical issue. Last year, the Justice Department charged Edwards with conspiracy, issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws. He has pleaded not guilty. Last September, the trial was delayed until January 30 after Edwards' attorneys said he needed more time, in part due to his position as the sole caretaker of his two youngest children, ages 11 and 13, after his wife, Elizabeth, passed away in December 2010. The motion to continue the trial for 60 days filed on December 22 said Edwards' \"unexpected\" medical issue is explained in a sealed exhibit. The issue will \"prevent a trial of this matter during the January 2012 criminal term,\" according to the motion, and cannot be resolved before the end of the term. Attorneys for Edwards, who was the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2004 alongside John Kerry, also say in the motion a January trial would not give them enough time to prepare, especially given the \"unusual and complex\" prosecution. \"Since this trial date was set, the government has produced as part of the discovery process an additional 103,102 pages of material including more than 91,000 e-mails as well as 26 voicemails received by cooperating witnesses between 2007 and 2010,\" the motion says. In addition, both the government and Edwards are seeking evidence from North Carolina state courts. \"Absent a continuance, Mr. Edwards' counsel will not be able to effectively use the evidence the government was obligated to provide him ... and this, in turn, threatens Mr. Edwards' right to effective counsel and a fair trial,\" according to the motion. \"This is not hyperbole. Mr. Edwards' counsel are experienced trial lawyers and they are and have been working hard -- long hours, late nights and weekends -- and they have not made it their practice to seek unwarranted continuances.\" It is unclear if a decision has been made on whether the trial has been delayed. A chief issue in the upcoming trial is whether money given to support Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter, by the then-candidate's benefactors should have been considered campaign donations, a contention Edwards' team has disputed. They maintain the money was a gift to Hunter. If convicted on all counts, Edwards could face 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1.5 million.","target":"The trial was set to start January 30 after a delay in September .\nEdwards' attorneys are asking for 60 more days .\nThey say they need time to review evidence provided by prosecutors .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"A status hearing regarding the pending criminal trial of former presidential candidate and U.S. senator, John Edwards, is set to take place in a North Carolina courtroom.

{"question":"Doc to summarize:NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- President George W. Bush called India's prime minister Thursday to push a proposed nuclear partnership that sparked an unsuccessful no-confidence vote against the Indian leader this week, a White House spokesman said. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh won a confidence vote despite opposition to the nuclear deal. \"Both leaders expressed their desire to see the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear issue move forward as expeditiously as possible,\" Gordon Johndroe said. The phone call took place two days after Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh narrowly survived the no-confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament. The vote was sparked by concerns from the opposition that India was kowtowing to the U.S. The tentative deal was announced in 2006 and signed by Bush and Singh a year ago. Under the agreement, which will need to be approved by the U.S. Congress, India would have access to U.S. nuclear fuel and technology for its civilian nuclear power plants. That would happen even though New Delhi, which tested nuclear weapons in 1974 and 1998, has declined to join international non-proliferation agreements. In return, India has promised that it would not transfer the fuel and equipment to its weapons program, and it would allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect at least 14 of its 22 nuclear plants. The plan would also expand U.S.-Indian cooperation in energy and satellite technology. The plan was approved by India's Cabinet last year, and does not have to be ratified by the parliament. The leaders of India's two communist parties -- which hold about 60 seats in Parliament -- have accused Singh of surrendering India's sovereignty to the United States with the deal. A no-confidence vote would have forced Singh to resign, and required the government to hold early elections unless a new coalition could have been formed. The Congress Party-led coalition has governed India since 2004. Tuesday's 275-256 vote was so crucial to the survival of Singh's government that five members of parliament serving prison sentences were freed to cast votes -- under the watchful eyes of their jailers. Shortly after Singh survived the vote, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino praised the deal as \"a good one for everybody.\" \"It's good for India because it would help provide them a source for energy that they need, one that is nonpolluting and one that doesn't emit greenhouse gas emissions,\" she said. \"And we think that we can move forward with this. If their legislature lets it move forward, then we can do the same here and then we'll be able to get this wrapped up.\"","target":"President Bush calls India's PM to push a proposed nuclear partnership .\nIndian government won confidence vote in face of anger over U.S. nuclear deal .\nFive members of parliament serving prison sentences were freed to vote .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"President George W.

The path leading from the stop where he catches the school bus to his family's farmhouse traverses a gently sloping hillside. All of a sudden, he made out something gray on the hillside. \"At first, I thought it might have been the neighbor's dogs,\" he later told TV2, Norway's largest commercial broadcaster. What he actually encountered, though, were four wolves. \n  \n \"I was afraid they would attack me,\" Walter told the Norwegian tabloid VG, describing the incident, which took place on Monday. But he didn't let his fear show. Remembering his parents' advice, Walter pulled the earphones out of his mobile phone, turned the volume all the way up and blasted heavy metal music over its miniature speakers. At the same time, he yelled as loud as he could while flailing his arms about wildly to scare off the pack of wild animals. \n  \n \"The worst thing you can do is run away because doing so just invites the wolves to chase you down,\" Walter told TV2. \"But I was so afraid that I couldn't even run away if I'd wanted to.\" \n  \n Overcoming the Wolves \n  \n The plan worked.

{"question":"(CNN) -- First, Brandeis University offered an honorary degree to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an outspoken critic of Islam. Then apparently when officials actually familiarized themselves with her writing after several complaints, they took the offer back this week. One Fox News contributor calls it \"an honor killing, Brandeis-style.\" That's crass, but the university's behavior is certainly disappointing. It smacks of cowardice, and Hirsi Ali can't be blamed for seeing it as an attack on her personal dignity. An act that was meant to honor her has been turned into an opportunity to shame her -- and, as she pointed out, \"The slur on my reputation is not the worst aspect of this episode. More deplorable is that an institution set up on the basis of religious freedom should today so deeply betray its own founding principles.\" Indeed, the fear of creating offense is not compatible with academic freedom. On the contrary, criticizing society in the boldest terms possible is what intellectuals are there to do. So Brandeis ought to have stood by its invitation. But there are some who would ask why it made the invitation in the first place. If the institution was worried about generating controversy, all it had to do was Google her name to discover that Hirsi Ali is a very controversial person. Indeed, her views fall well outside of the mainstream. Hirsi Ali's story is undeniably moving. Born in Somalia, she was the victim of female genital mutilation at the age of 5 and was betrothed into an arranged marriage, which she escaped by seeking political asylum in the Netherlands. Thereafter she emerged as a forceful, politically engaged critic of Islam -- her memoir, \"Infidel,\" is an extraordinary testament to the horrors that fundamentalism can wrought on an individual. Her ethnicity excuses her from the charge of racism; her politics is not reactionary but rather a very muscular variety of liberal universalism. However, the Islam that Hirsi Ali knew and denounces is a narrow cultural experience -- not the reality of the religion as a whole. There is no female genital mutilation in the Koran; tribes do it because it is a custom, not a legitimate religious instruction. Likewise, the extreme Islamism that threatens the West -- and against which the right campaigns -- is a small, geographically limited phenomenon that is almost unrelated to the considerably more liberal forms of Islam practiced in, say, Bangladesh or Europe. It is true that Taliban Afghanistan or Iran have been theocratic, but this doesn't make Islam incompatible with democracy. Far from it: Muslim political protest has been the heart and soul of the Arab Spring. And Hirsi Ali's insistence that \"violence is inherent in Islam\" is absurd. Violence is inherent in all of humanity -- you only have to read the Judeo-Christian Old Testament to find that out. And if violence was a purely Muslim thing, wouldn't we expect Muslims universally to hold fascistic views? On the contrary, evidence suggests that globally they lean toward democracy, pluralism and a qualified gender equality. Moreover, Hirsi Ali's personal experience of life growing up in war-torn Africa is a million miles away from that lived among second- or third-generation Muslim immigrants in Europe. There the picture is one of integration, spoiled only by a handful of radicals who were tolerated by both the state and the Islamic community for far too long. British journalist Fraser Nelson recently wrote a widely read piece pointing out that newspaper headlines about Islamic fundamentalism give a distorted view of religious relations in the United Kingdom. He noted, \"Last year ... the Jews of Bradford were facing the closure of their synagogue. Its roof was leaking, and the few dozen remaining regulars could not afford the repairs ... As things turned out, the synagogue was saved after a fundraising campaign led by a local mosque. Zulfi Karim, the secretary of Bradford's Council of Mosques, now refers to (synagogue chairman Rudi) Leavor -- who fled the Nazis -- as his 'newfound brother.' \" When I wrote a piece in the same newspaper arguing that Islam was very close to Britishness in its obsession with good manners, hospitality and charity, I received dozens of abusive missives from white supremacists. It was a reminder that the flipside of Islamism is anti-Muslim hate. Which, I'm afraid to say, is given propaganda material by the well-dressed, middle-class intellectuals who appear so frequently on our televisions to pronounce that \"violence is inherent in Islam.\" All of which doesn't mean that Hirsi Ali should be driven from the public sphere. On the contrary, her story is a testament to the evil that does exist in the world, and Brandeis should have stood by its decision to honor her. The right to speak freely should never be tampered with. But in the conversation about the limits to this speech that has followed, let this one fact be remembered: Hirsi Ali's views are deemed politically incorrect for good reason.","target":"Timothy Stanley: Brandeis withdrew honorary degree offer to Islam critic Ayaan Hirsi Ali .\nHe says move runs counter to academic freedom, Brandeis shouldn't have withdrawn it .\nHad university vetted her, it would have seen her views on Islam are narrow, he says .\nStanley: Hirsi Ali's views are deemed politically incorrect for good reason .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Brandeis University rescinded its offer of an honorary degree to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a critic of Islam, after familiarizing themselves with her writings.

{"question":"(CNN) -- A 22-year-old college student in Boston, Massachusetts, has been charged with murder in connection with the death of a woman who may have been contacted through a Craigslist ad, police said. Police found Julissa Brisman, 26, unconscious with multiple gunshot wounds on April 14. She later died. Philip Markoff, a pre-med student at Boston University with no criminal record, also was charged with the armed robbery and kidnapping of another victim, Police Commissioner Ed Davis announced Monday evening. Markoff, who was under police surveillance, was arrested earlier in the afternoon after a traffic stop south of the city, police said. Markoff is suspected in the death of New York City resident Julissa Brisman, 26, who was found unconscious with multiple gunshot wounds at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel on April 14. She was transferred to Boston Medical Center, where she died from her injuries shortly afterward. Police said that Brisman, a model, offered massages via Craigslist, a popular online classified ads service. The confrontation between Brisman and her killer seems to have begun as an attempted robbery, police said. \"It appears that there was a struggle between the victim and the suspect in the threshold of the hotel room immediately prior to the shooting,\" the Boston Police Department said in a statement posted on  its Web site. Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blonde man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, said the Boston Police Department, which had asked for the public's help in identifying the man. Police did not release a photo of Markoff on Monday. Four days before Brisman's killing, Markoff allegedly robbed a 29-year-old woman at gunpoint at a Westin Hotel in Boston, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said. A police spokesman would not disclose the details of her Craigslist ad but said she and Brisman were \"involved in similar professions.\" \"This is a compelling case with a myriad of evidence -- with computer evidence being a part of it,\" Conley said, adding that additional search warrants would be executed this week. Markoff's arraignment was set for Tuesday morning at the Boston Municipal Court. It was not immediately clear if he had retained defense counsel. Davis and Conley warned there may be other victims that come forward in the case. \"We would like to make one final pitch to those out there who may have been a victim of robbery at the hands of Philip Markoff, especially those who may have used Craigslist in the manner in which the victim used Craigslist,\" he said. Authorities received more than 150 leads in the case, which Davis credited to the popularity of the Web site. \"The public came forth, they were fascinated by this crime,\" he said, adding, \"I wish we had this level of cooperation in every homicide that occurred.\" Davis said Boston investigators were working with police in Warwick, Rhode Island, in what could be a related case. On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, according to Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, according to McCartney. He said no conclusions could be made, but allowed that the incident \"may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area.\"  Watch police say assailant is perusing Craigslist ads \u00bb . Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster said the company was \"horrified and deeply saddened that our community services have been associated in any way whatsoever with a crime of violence.\" He promised that Craigslist would evaluate the incident to see if additional measures could be introduced to further protect users.

{"question":"Washington (CNN) -- Dennis Ross, one of the president's top advisers dealing with Middle East policy, announced Thursday he's stepping down from his post, leaving prospects for the administration's efforts to restart the peace process even more uncertain. He cited a promise he made to his wife to serve in the Obama administration for only two years. Ross, who has held key diplomatic positions during the administrations of George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton as well as Barack Obama, issued a statement saying, \"It has been an honor to work in the Obama administration and to serve this president, particularly during a period of unprecedented change in the broader Middle East.\" He added, \"Obviously, there is still work to do, but I promised my wife I would return to government for only two years and we both agreed it is time to act on my promise. \"I am grateful to President Obama for having given me the opportunity once again to work on a wide array of Middle Eastern issues and challenges and to support his efforts to promote peace in the region.\" Ross's formal title is special assistant to the president and senior director for the \"central region,\" the key area that includes Israel, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Persian Gulf, and South Asia. His influence is hard to understate, having been handed a portfolio that includes the United States' most pressing national security interests and regions that have undergone significant turmoil over the past two years. Ross' departure comes at a particularly difficult time for the Obama administration, which has at times clashed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Middle East peace process and is dealing with the unpredictable aftermath of the Arab Spring. The departure also follows that of the special envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell, who left the administration in May, only days before Netanyahu visited the White House. During his daily briefing Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney called Ross a \"remarkable contributor to this administration.\" \"He is ... very much a part and an architect of the sanctions regime and efforts to pressure and isolate Iran, and has been at the forefront of our deliberations about handling the Arab Spring, the remarkable events we have seen in the Middle East and North Africa this year,\" Carney said.

{"question":"(CNN) -- A policeman and a former corrections officer say that on Friday they will unveil evidence of what they claim is their biggest find ever: the body of Bigfoot. The thawed body of a creature reputed to be Bigfoot reportedly weighs more than 500 pounds. Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer, a pair of Bigfoot-hunting hobbyists from north Georgia, say they found the creature's body in a wooded area and spotted several similar creatures that were still alive. The carcass of the furry half-man, half-ape is 7 feet, 7 inches tall and weighs more than 500 pounds, they say. However, the two are not disclosing the exact location of their discovery to protect the remaining creatures. Tom Nelson, chairman of the biology department at North Georgia College and State University in Dahlonega, said he's \"pretty skeptical\" the world will feast its eyes on a new species Friday. \"That would certainly rock mammalogy,\" joked Nelson, who specializes in the study of mammals. \"I see a research grant in my future.\" Whitton and Dyer plan to unveil what they say is DNA and photo evidence of the discovery in Palo Alto, California, in conjunction with a group called Searching for Bigfoot Inc. A photograph on that group's Web site shows what appears to be the body of a large, hairy creature with an ape-like face, stuffed into a large freezer. According to a written release, the two announced the discovery on an Internet radio show, \"Squatch Detective,\" several weeks ago. iReport.com: Do you believe in Bigfoot? \"The only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was 'the Real Bigfoot Hunter,' Tom Biscardi,\" Dyer said, referring to Searching for Bigfoot's CEO, who has been looking for the elusive, legendary creature in the United States and Canada since 1971. Whitton is a Georgia police officer who is on administrative leave after being shot in the wrist during a pursuit. Dyer is a former prison guard. DNA tests on the body have begun, said the statement, and \"extensive scientific studies\" will be done on the body by scientists, including a molecular biologist, an anthropologist and a paleontologist. Nelson, the university professor, acknowledged that new species of animals have been discovered in recent decades and that, in science, \"we always acknowledge the possibility of something new.\" But he said that even in north Georgia, home to the Blue Ridge Mountains and the foot of the Appalachian Trail, it stretches the imagination to think a family of 7-foot-tall creatures could have eluded hunters, hikers and creeping development until now. \"To the average person, these places just seem like extreme wilderness where you'll find lions and tigers and bears,\" he said. \"The reality is that you're never more than a mile from a road.\" The group says the animal is male, has reddish hair and \"blackish-gray\" eyes and human-like feet, hands and teeth.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic's hopes of winning a second Wimbledon title were boosted Friday when the world No. 1 was drawn in the opposite half of the field from his three main tennis rivals. The Serbian, who triumphed at the grass-court grand slam in 2011, cannot face defending champion Roger Federer, second-ranked Andy Murray or two-time winner Rafael Nadal before the July 7 men's final. Nadal has been seeded a lowly fifth despite his successful comeback from long-term knee injury, which culminated in a record eighth French Open title this month. He lost in the second round at London's SW19 a year ago, which turned out to be his last match until February. The 27-year-old faces the prospect of renewing his rivalry with Federer in the quarterfinals, and the winner of that match will possibly face Murray. Murray, last year's runner-up, is seeded to play France's world No. 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the last eight. Murray will begin his bid to become Britain's first male champion since Fred Perry in 1936 when he takes on Benjamin Becker. He defeated the 32-year-old German -- as well as Tsonga -- on the way to winning the title at Queen's Club on Sunday, having missed the French Open due to injury. Federer, seeded third, will start against Romania's Victor Hanescu in Monday's opening matches as he seeks to win his 18th grand slam title and a record eighth Wimbledon crown. Nadal, on a 22-match winning streak, will play 113th-ranked Belgian Steve Darcis in the first round while Djokovic takes on Germany's Florian Mayer. Djokovic could play world No. 6 Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals ahead of a possible match against Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer -- who could face eighth-ranked Argentine Juan Martin del Potro in the last eight. Ferrer reached his first grand slam final at Roland Garros this month, but had no answer to an in-form Nadal -- who had beaten Djokovic in an epic semi encounter. In the Wimbledon women's draw, defending champion and top seed Serena Williams cannot face Maria Sharapova or Victoria Azarenka until the final. The American, who beat Sharapova in the French Open final, could face a rematch of last year's title match with fourth-ranked Pole Agnieszka Radwanska in the semis. The 31-year-old will first take on Luxembourg's 77th-ranked Mandy Minella, who lost in the first round last year. Radwanska is drawn to meet China's former French Open champion Li Na in the last eight. Sharapova, seeded third after dropping below Azarenka in the rankings, having failed to defend her title at Roland Garros, will start against 20-year-old Kristina Mladenovic of France. The Russian, who won the tournament as a 17-year-old in 2004, is seeded to face Italian No. 5 Sara Errani in the quarterfinals before a possible clash with Azarenka -- who she beat in the Paris semis. Australian Open champion Azarenka, who starts against 112th-ranked Maria Joao Koehler of Portugal, is drawn to play 2011 Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova in the last eight.","target":"World No. 1 Novak Djokovic in opposite half of draw from rest of men's \"Big Four\"\nRafael Nadal and Roger Federer could meet as early as quarterfinals at Wimbledon .\nThe winner of that match could then face last year's runner-up Andy Murray .\nWomen's champion Serena Williams in opposite half of draw to Maria Sharapova .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Novak Djokovic's chances of winning a second Wimbledon title were improved when he was drawn in the opposite half of the field from his main rivals, Roger Federer, Andy Murray, and Rafael Nadal.

{"question":"(CNN) -- The prominent man had an altercation with his wife at a hotel. He beat her up. There's even a recording of it. And what happened? A plea deal so generous that the abuser's arrest record will be expunged -- totally clean, as if the whole thing had never happened -- if he receives some counseling in the next few months. Ray Rice? Yes. But Rice's case is strikingly similar to that of Mark Fuller, a sitting federal judge in Alabama. On August 9, Fuller's wife called 911 from a hotel room in Atlanta, according to news reports. The woman identified as Kelli Fuller said her drunk husband was assaulting her. \"He's beating on me. Please help me,\" she said. About a minute into the call, as dispatchers summon help, Kelli Fuller is heard saying \"I hate you, I hate you.\" A male voice responds: \"I hate you too,\" followed by dull noises in the background. According to police, Kelli Fuller had cuts to her mouth and forehead and she told them her husband had thrown her to the ground, pulled her hair and kicked her after she confronted him over an alleged affair with a law clerk. Last week, the whole matter was swept discreetly under the rug. Mark Fuller accepted \"pretrial diversion\" offered by Atlanta prosecutors. Under the deal, the judge has to have a drug and alcohol evaluation -- which, according to his lawyer, he doesn't need. \"He doesn't have a drug or alcohol problem and never has,\" Barry Ragsdale, Fuller's attorney, told al.com. Then, Fuller will have to undergo a once-a-week family and domestic violence program for 24 weeks. The judge can undergo that counseling at a location close to home in Alabama. What happens after Fuller completes counseling? He plans to return to the bench, to pass judgment on others. As Fuller put it, \"I also look forward to ... returning to full, active status in the Middle District of Alabama.\" (His cases have been temporarily reassigned. Taxpayers are paying him his full salary in the meantime.) The parallels between the Rice and Fuller cases extend further. In both cases, the couples stayed together. After Ray beat his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer, unconscious in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the couple married. Janay Rice attended the July meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that led to his appallingly lenient two-game suspension from the Baltimore Ravens. NFL toughens domestic violence policy with six-game bans . After TMZ released the video of the elevator assault, Janay Rice released a statement of support for her husband, on Instagram. \"To take something away from the man I love that he has worked for all his life just to gain ratings is horrific,\" she wrote, \"If your intentions were to hurt us, embarrass us, make us feel alone, take our happiness away, you've succeeded on so many levels. Just know we will continue to grow & show the world what love is.\" Fuller is also attempting, apparently successfully, to repair the breach with his wife. \"This incident has been very embarrassing to me, my family, friends and the court,\" he said in his statement, \"I deeply regret this incident and look forward to working to resolve these difficulties with my family, where they should be resolved.\" Consider that last line: \"my family, where they should be resolved.\" This is precisely wrong, and it contributes to a fundamental misunderstanding about domestic violence. When husbands beat up their wives, that is not a matter that should be resolved within the family. It is a crime to be resolved by the legal system. In cases of domestic violence, the question is often raised whether the victim will \"press charges.\" But it's not victims who press charges in this country, it's the state. Ray Rice video prompts stories of #WhyIStayed, #WhyILeft . It's not up to victims to decide whether their husbands should be prosecuted. Abusers damage the community, not just the women they assault. Whether the Rices and Fullers stay married is their business; but whether Ray Rice and Judge Mark Fuller committed crimes should be a question for prosecutors, and ultimately, juries to decide. Unfortunately, it looks like the prosecutors failed in Atlantic City and Atlanta. The sweet deals for these two prominent defendants cannot be undone; the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution forbids it. All the rest of us can do is hope that the next prominent man who beats up his wife doesn't get off as easy.","target":"Jeffrey Toobin: Ray Rice case mirrors Alabama judge's case; both got plea deals .\nHe says audio of Judge Mark Fuller documents beating; cops say wife had injuries .\nFuller said issue should be resolved within family.

{"question":"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Deadly bombings in two London parks on July 20, 1982 represented a dark day in the bloody conflict between Irish republicans and the British government -- now their legacy threatens to derail Northern Ireland's hard-fought peace process. Eleven British soldiers -- some members of Queen Elizabeth II's Household Cavalry regiment, others part of a military band -- died during blasts in Hyde Park and Regent's Park. One of the men accused of being behind the Hyde Park attack -- believed to have been carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) -- walked free this week after it emerged in court that he had a letter from the British government from 2007 -- the 25th anniversary of the bombings -- assuring him he did not face prosecution for IRA crimes. Prosecutors argued the letter was sent \"in error\" to John Anthony Downey, 62, and that authorities at the time had failed to register an outstanding warrant for his arrest in connection with the 1982 attack. Downey, who denies planting the bomb that killed four of the soldiers, was not the only one to be given immunity. Almost 200 other Irish republican terror suspects were too. Covert deal . According to British media, 187 so-called \"comfort letters\" were sent to suspected IRA terrorists such as Downey -- known as \"on the runs\" -- who sought clarification about their status after a peace settlement in 1998, known as the Good Friday Agreement, which brought the decades-long \"troubles\" in Northern Ireland to an end. The letters were part of a covert deal struck between the British government and republicans -- who bitterly opposed British rule -- to ease the reconciliation process. Now the historic power-sharing government in Northern Ireland -- which brought unionists and republicans together -- appears in grave danger of collapsing. The top lawmaker in the administration, First Minister Peter Robinson, said it had been plunged into crisis over the deal allowing suspected terrorists to walk free. Robinson has threatened to resign, saying he had been kept in the dark over the years about the secret \"letters of assurance.\" He said he only found out after the London court judgment. And he's supposed to be in charge here. His partner in government, Martin McGuinness -- himself a former IRA commander -- urged him to pull back from the brink of bringing down the government. The nationalist Sinn Fein leader took to social media to say: \"My unionist colleagues need to calm down. We've all come a long way. No sensible person will thank anyone for threatening the institutions.\" British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, stressed the British government \"does not support amnesties for people wanted by the police in connection with terrorist offenses,\" and that Downey \"was part of an administrative scheme for dealing with 'on-the-runs' set up by the previous government.\" She added that the government would be working with the police to identify whether there are other cases similar to that of Downey. Imperfect peace . The tension is a sign of the times in Northern Ireland. There's peace but an imperfect one. The bombings and sectarian murders have largely stopped, although small groupings of IRA dissidents continue to pose a threat. Pro-British paramilitary groups also remain active. Emotions continue to run high between the pro-British and pro-Irish communities over issues such as parades and the flying of the British Union flag. The parades are particularly controversial -- groups from both sides of the unionist\/nationalist divide would claim they hold marches as a celebration of their culture, while critics would argue they are asserting their rights over communities across Northern Ireland. American diplomat Richard N. Haass was flown into Belfast to chair all-party talks last year in a bid to find a resolution to outstanding issues -- the talks ended without agreement. Marching season . Through it all, the power-sharing administration at Stormont -- Northern Ireland's Parliament Buildings -- in Belfast has held. The present-day political and economic challenges were being worked through. But the past has proved more difficult to deal with. And with elections on the horizon, compromise might not be viewed as a policy to win votes. Another controversial summer marching season looms with the prospect of violent clashes at disputed locations. The trouble tends to be confined to certain neighborhoods, mainly working class districts of Belfast. But the shockwaves can be felt across Northern Ireland. IRA dissidents lurk in the background desperate to launch attacks. Many victims of decades of paramilitary violence believe their voices are being ignored. Of course, there are many economic challenges too, with a sluggish economy and an unemployment rate above the UK average. It promises to be an interesting year in Northern Ireland. And while the politicians fight, the vast majority of people on both sides of the religious divide are united -- praying for peace.","target":"1982 IRA bomb attacks on two London parks killed 11 British soldiers .\nSuspect walks free, one of many terror suspects given immunity as part of peace process .\nNorthern Ireland's top lawmaker has threatened to quit over these covert deals .\nFears this could break up historic power-sharing government and threaten peace .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The legacy of the 1982 bombings in London parks, which killed 11 British soldiers and were believed to be carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), threatens to destabilize Northern Ireland's peace process.

{"question":"(CNN) -- A Ukrainian journalist detained Tuesday by pro-Russian rebels while working as a freelance producer for CNN has been freed. Anton Skiba called CNN on Saturday to confirm his release. CNN also received visual confirmation that Skiba is free from sources on the ground in Donetsk. On Tuesday evening, armed fighters led by a senior official from the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic were waiting outside the Donbass Palace Hotel, in the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk, as CNN television crew returned from a day's work at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Skiba had worked for one day with the CNN crew when he was detained. Skiba's work as a journalist for CNN also encompassed translating and providing local knowledge. An official with the Donetsk People's Republic initially accused Skiba of \"terrorism\" and of posting offers, on his Facebook page, of cash rewards for the killing of rebel fighters. The official later dropped the accusation about the Facebook posts and said Skiba was being questioned for having multiple forms of identification with different surnames. On July 11, Alexandr Kalyussky -- the senior official who detained Skiba -- was added to the growing list of rebel officials to face sanctions from the European Union.

{"question":"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- A medical group in Argentina is asking for more drug-testing regulations in the South American country after a officials fined pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline for alleged irregularities in a pediatric pneumonia vaccine trial. The Argentinian Federation of Health Professionals accuses drug maker GlaxoSmithKline of misleading participants and pressuring poor families into joining a trial for the Synflorix vaccine, which the company says protects against bacterial pneumonia and meningitis. \"They recruited children in an irregular manner. ... They did not do what they were supposed to. They did not inform. There were not independent witnesses. They pressured the mothers of poor children,\" said Jorge Yabkowsky, the federation's director. But GlaxoSmithKline, the world's second largest pharmaceutical company, denies those accusations and says it will appeal a judge's approval of Argentina's National Administration of Medicine, Food and Medical Technology's fining the company and two doctors a total of nearly $240,000 for irregularities in documentation of the trial. In a statement, GlaxoSmithKline said it conducts clinical studies all over the world, respecting laws and meeting the highest standards of ethics and quality. \"The ruling has to do with procedures, with the form of documenting procedures of the studies. ... None of the patients that were included in this study were included without their appropriate consent,\" said Rosana Felice, medical director of Glaxo Argentina. Felice said official investigations by Argentina's drug administration, known as ANMAT, and ethics reviews have not turned up any irregularities in the vaccine's safety. GlaxoSmithKline's statement said there are no cases alleging fraud or corruption in the study. The deaths of 14 children who reportedly died after participating in the trials, have drawn widespread attention in Argentinian media. Their deaths are under investigation, but there has been no evidence linking deaths to the vaccine or irregularities in the studies. Felice said GlaxoSmithKline categorically denies that the vaccine caused the deaths. \"In no case was it related to the administration of the vaccine, and this has been sufficiently demonstrated, proven and evaluated by ANMAT,\" Felice said. But the health professional federation pointed to the children's deaths in its call for increased regulations on drug testing. The trial included 24,000 children, Felice said, including 14,000 children in Argentina and 10,000 others in Colombia and Panama. The Synflorix vaccine has been approved by regulatory agencies in more than 85 countries, based on more than 40 clinical studies, GlaxoSmithKline said.","target":"Argentina's drug administration has fined the company and two doctors nearly $240,000 .\nA medical group accuses GlaxoSmithKline of misleading trial participants .\nThe drug company denies those accusations and says it will appeal the fine .\nGlaxoSmithKline says there were no irregularities regarding consent or the vaccine's safety .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The Argentinian Federation of Health Professionals is calling for stricter drug-testing regulations after GlaxoSmithKline was fined for alleged irregularities in a pediatric pneumonia vaccine trial.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Megaupload users have gotten at least a two-week reprieve during which the file-sharing company says it hopes their files and other stored data can be retrieved, not deleted. The news comes days after a federal prosecutor said user data on the site, which is accused of knowingly hosting illegally pirated material, could be deleted as early as this week. Megaupload's attorney now says the companies that own the servers where the files are stored have agreed to wait while a solution is pursued. \"Carpathia and Cogent agreed to preserve consumer data for additional time of at least two weeks so #Megaupload can work with US on proposal,\" attorney Ira Rothken said late Monday on Twitter. One of those companies, Carpathia Hosting, said Tuesday that it's working with Internet-rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation to help users get their data back. \"Although Carpathia does not have, and has never had, access to the content on Megaupload's servers, the hosting provider wants to assist lawful users of the Megaupload service by promoting EFF and its nonprofit legal services,\" the company said in a statement. The company has created a website, megaretrieval.com, to help those users. Federal prosecutors on Friday had said files, presumably including perfectly legal ones, may be deleted, starting as soon as Thursday. \"It is our understanding that the hosting companies may begin deleting the contents of the servers beginning as early as February 2, 2012,\" U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride said in a letter filed in federal court. The letter, submitted Friday in the Eastern District of Virginia, says that government investigators had finished executing search warrants at centers where Megaupload and MegaVideo files are stored. MacBride wrote that the government copied some data but didn't remove any. Now that the search has been finished, the government no longer has access to the servers, he said. Seven people associated with the popular site were indicted this month on charges that they knowingly operated an \"international organized criminal enterprise\" allowing worldwide sharing of illegally pirated movies, music and other media. Attorneys for Megaupload, which is based in Hong Kong, have denied the charges. The indictment alleges the company has denied copyright holders an estimated $500 million and that those indicted have earned roughly $175 million in the process. Lost in the shuffle, though, may be millions of legitimate files stored on the site by its users. According to the government's indictment, Megaupload has claimed more than 180 million registered users in its five-year existence. While some of those users say they went to the site to look for movies, television shows and other material that may be copyrighted, numerous others have complained that they've lost access to personal and professional materials stored there. In the Carpathia statement, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation said the group is \"troubled\" that lawful users have \"had their property taken from them without warning and that the government has taken no steps to help them.\" \"We think it's important that these users have their voices heard as this process moves forward,\" said Julie Samuels, a staff attorney at the foundation.","target":"Companies have two weeks to save Megaupload files, lawyer says .\nAnnouncement comes after feds said files might be deleted this week .\nThe file-sharing and storage site is accused of allowing piracy .\nServer companies are working to help users get Megaupload files, lawyer says .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Megaupload users have been granted a two-week reprieve to retrieve their files and data, which were at risk of deletion following the site's accusations of hosting illegally pirated material.

Harpham, an unemployed electrician from Colville, Washington, pleaded guilty in September to charges of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to commit a federal hate crime. Shrapnel in the \"improvised explosive device\" contained anticoagulant to prevent blood clotting, authorities said. After he is released from prison, Harpham will serve the rest of his life under court supervision, federal prosecutors said. \"Harpham admitted that he is a white supremacist and white separatist, and that he placed the explosive device at the march with the intent to cause bodily injury to the person or persons in order to further his racist beliefs,\" a Justice Department statement said. Federal prosecutors had recommended that Harpham be sentenced to 32 years in prison, according to court documents. He was sentenced in federal court in Spokane. The January 17 march was attended by about 2,000 people, including racial minorities, authorities said. \"Today, Mr. Harpham faces the consequences of his hate-filled act.

But law enforcement officials said that if Harpham had succeeded, many people could have been harmed. He had packed a 6-inch steel pipe with 100 grams of black powder and more than 100 fishing weights, which were intended to be shrapnel. In addition, Harpham coated the weights with an anticoagulant. According to court documents, he intended to set off his bomb using a transmitter and receiver from a remote car starter device.

{"question":"(CNN) -- If this weekend's box office battle was a big-screen boxing match, it would have been the original \"Rocky\": grinning, glamorous Apollo Creed against little-known and less-regarded Rocky Balboa. No one expected that one to go the full 15 rounds, either. In this weekend's showdown, it was the established \"Gone Girl\" against newcomer fantasy action flick \"Dracula Untold.\" \"Gone Girl\" held the title belt, but not by much: the adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best-seller earned roughly $26.8 million compared with \"Dracula Untold's\" $23.5 million. But \"Gone Girl\" seemed to have everything going for it, including big-name stars (led by Oscar winner Ben Affleck), critical acclaim and tremendous word of mouth. Estimated second-weekend ticket sales fell just 29%, compared with the 40% to 50% decline most box office champs suffer in their second week out. Unlike the champ, \"Untold\" seemed to have everything going against it. With the lead role held by Luke Evans, best known as the bad guy in last year's \"Fast & Furious 6,\" there was a lack of major stars. Then there was the consideration of competition: Horror movie \"Annabelle\" had opened the previous weekend, and unlike last year, most fright flicks are underperforming in 2014. And the reviews? Most critics put a stake through its heart, leaving \"Dracula Untold\" at a putrid 26% on RottenTomatoes.com. Yet when the dust settled, \"Dracula Untold\" was the weekend's top new movie. It's a fresh take on the Dracula legend: Evans plays Vlad as a heroic figure who's willing to do anything, including join the undead, to protect his family and his homeland. When you add in international ticket sales, the action-horror movie has already made back its $70 million budget. Newcomer \"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day\" also had much going for it, making its debut with big stars (Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner) and a story based on a much-loved book (Judith Viorst's 1972 children's classic). While the live-action comedy knocked rival family film \"The Boxtrolls\" well down the chart, it also found itself sitting on the sidelines in third place. The weekend's other new movies, \"The Judge,\" starring Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall, and \"Addicted,\" starring Sharon Leal and Boris Kodjoe, performed about as expected, debuting fifth and seventh, respectively. And after 2\u00c2\u00bd months, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" finally fell out of the top 10. That said, people are still going to see the top-grossing movie of the year: It's up to $326 million domestic. Turns out we are all Groot. Weekend domestic box office estimates from Exhibitor Relations Co., with final numbers available Monday afternoon: . 1. \"Gone Girl\": $26.8 million ($78.3 million total) 2. \"Dracula Untold\": $23.5 million (debut) 3. \"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day\": $19.1 million (debut) 4. \"Annabelle\": $16.4 million ($62.2 million total) 5. \"The Judge\": $13.3 million (debut)","target":"\"Dracula Untold\" was the weekend's top new movie .\nBut returning champ \"Gone Girl\" held the title belt .\nFamily comedy \"Alexander\" opened at No. 3 .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The box office battle between the established \"Gone Girl\" and newcomer \"Dracula Untold\" resulted in a close race, with \"Gone Girl\" earning roughly $26.8 million compared to \"Dracula Untold's\" $23.5 million.

{"question":"Editor's note: Join Roland S. Martin for his weekly sound-off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. ET Wednesday. If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. A nationally syndicated columnist, Martin has said he will vote for Barack Obama in November. He is the author of \"Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith\" and \"Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America.\" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says the McCain campaign has done Sarah Palin a disservice by keeping her hidden. (CNN) -- Is Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin running for vice president of the United States or vice president of the student council? Listening to some political strategists, pundits and radio and TV blowhards, you would think that all she has to do is show up, sign her name on the roll, and she's done enough to satisfy the requirement for president. Do people really and truly understand that she will be sitting a heartbeat away from the presidency, backing up a 72-year-old guy who has a history of cancer? Nothing drives me nuts more than listening to some of these folks who act as if we shouldn't expect Palin -- and Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Joe Biden -- to be well-versed on national issues, foreign policy and the social and cultural issues that have to define America. Conventional wisdom says that the vice president means nothing and that the voters going to the polls between now and November 4 are really voting on Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain. iReport.com: What would you ask Palin, Biden? But looking at the role that the last few vice presidents have played, especially Vice President Dick Cheney, it is clear that the VP can make a world of difference and that we should be demanding the tough answers to tough questions from both candidates. Now, the blowhards have been going on and on, suggesting that too much attention is being paid to her gaffes and not to those of Biden. True. But what we have learned this election season is that there are double standards. Countless folks have said that we all know McCain, and it's necessary to scrutinize every aspect of Obama. Really? I think if you ask the average person, they'll know a lot more about Obama's childhood than McCain, solely by the level of scrutiny. The truth is, the nation doesn't know much about Palin. And when folks don't know a lot about you, there is an expectation to get to know more. As for Palin, I fundamentally believe that millions of Americans want to know what she thinks about the critical issues of the day and not from reading cue cards. The McCain camp has done her a huge disservice by treating her like a Faberge egg, totally untouchable. She needed to do multiple media interviews and not keep an arm's distance from the media and, yes, the general public. Back to that low expectation thing. The reality is that the McCain camp and Republicans want that. Even Biden and the Obama camp are tamping down expectations, hoping that if the bar is set just above someone's ankle, it will be easy to cross. Hogwash. Now is not the time for low bars and low expectations. We need our candidates to think big and be big. They need to speak to our concerns and our fears. And yes, Biden has been around a long time, and many say they know what to expect from the loquacious one. But Palin must strut her stuff. Thursday's debate will not be read from a teleprompter. It won't be on cue cards. With the nation watching, she is going to put up or shut up. What is most at stake is whether she's the subject of further ridicule or can show Americans that she has a strong command of the issues. If she can do the latter, she validates McCain's selection. If not, she calls into question his judgment, and at this stage of the game, that is not a good thing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","target":"Vice presidential candidate can make world of difference, Roland Martin says .\nMcCain campaign has done Palin a disservice, he writes .\nMartin says American people want to know where she stands .\nThursday's debate will be proving ground, Martin writes .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Roland S.

{"question":"(CNN) -- A writer commissioned to help launch a new \"Adventures of Superman\" digital comics series is drawing controversy for the comics' publisher not for his perception of the Man of Steel, but for his perception of marriage -- specifically, his opposition to same-sex marriage. Science fiction writer Orson Scott Card has been commissioned by longtime \"Superman\" publisher DC Comics to write a two-part story launching its new \"Adventures of Superman\" digital series. Card is perhaps best known for the classic 1985 sci-fi novel \"Ender's Game,\" but he also has sparked controversy with his outspoken criticism of homosexuality and same-sex marriage. \"Just because you give legal sanction to a homosexual couple and call their contract a 'marriage' does not make it a marriage,\" Card wrote in a 2004 essay titled \"Homosexual 'Marriage' and Civilization.\" The essay concluded, \" ... either civilized people will succeed in establishing a government that protects the family...or the politically correct barbarians will have complete victory over the family -- and, lacking the strong family structure on which civilization depends, our civilization will collapse or fade away.\" News that Card would be among writers on the new \"Adventures of Superman\" digital comics prompted marriage-equality group AllOut.org to launch a petition drive aimed at DC Comics. \"By hiring Orson Scott Card despite his anti-gay efforts you are giving him a new platform and supporting his hate,\" reads the petition -- now with nearly 12,000 signatures, according to the group. Card is no stranger to comic-book writing. He has written for Marvel Comics, penning series such as \"Ultimate Iron Man\" and comics based on his own \"Ender's Game\" among others. The new \"Adventures of Superman\" is not DC Comics' long-running, flagship \"Superman\" comic books but an ongoing digital anthology series of short stories about the hero that will be written by various authors. DC Comics, a division of Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, issued a statement Wednesday defending its decision to include Card among the writers. \"As content creators we steadfastly support freedom of expression, however the personal views of individuals associated with DC Comics are just that -- personal views -- and not those of the company itself,\" the statement said. Card declined to comment to CNN. Mitch Cutler, whose store, St. Mark's Comics has been open in New York City's East Village neighborhood for nearly 30 years, seemed to agree. \"Someone did tweet to us about boycotting the series, but since the first day (we opened) we have been committed to carrying everything we can in comics,\" Cutler said. \"I'm sure right now on the shelves there is content I might not necessarily agree with. So while I understand Mr. Card may have advocated things that might upset people, it would be very uncharacteristic of us to refuse to carry something for that reason.\" Jermaine Exum who manages Acme Comics in Greensboro, North Carolina -- the city where Card lives -- has a slightly different reason for deciding to carry the comics. \"Our main focus is that other creators are working on this,\" including artists like Jeff Parker who has ties to Acme, Exum said. \"The public is running away with the Orson Scott Card story, but I don't want to short-change these other people working on the series.\" Phil Jimenez, an openly gay writer and comic-book artist who has worked on \"Astonishing X-men,\" \"Captain America Corps,\" \"The Amazing Spiderman\" and more, is not OK with the decision, and believes Card's stance on homosexuality and same-sex marriage takes away certain people's civil rights. \"I'm encouraging people not to buy his work because when they do they actively support a foully bigoted man who uses his power and influence to affect public policy,\" Jimenez tweeted. Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, which has actively campaigned against same-sex marriage efforts and which counts Card as a member of its board of directors, says protesting Card's comics is un-American. \"For a movement that says it's focused on civil rights, it's surprising that supporters of gay marriage want to attack an opposing viewpoint and become violent,\" Brown told CNN. The decision to include Card comes at a time when the world of comics, while sometimes still criticized for over-sexualizing female characters, has moved to make homosexual characters a big part of storylines. In July 2012, in the second issue of \"Earth 2,\" a new series in DC Comics' \"The New 52,\" reimagining of many classic DC characters, Alan Scott, the first Green Lantern is an openly gay man. The series, along with DC's Batwoman, is up for a 2013 Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Media Award. Marvel Comics had its first same-sex wedding in a June 2012 issue of \"Astonishing X-Men\" with superhero Northstar -- the first major comic-book character to come out as gay in 1992 -- marrying his longtime partner, Kyle. CNN's Dominique Debucquoy-Dodley contributed to this report.","target":"Writer Orson Scott Card will pen a new \"Adventures of Superman\" digital comics series .\nCard also has written outspoken criticism of homosexuality and same-sex marriage .\nA marriage-equality group launches a petition aimed at the \"Superman\" publisher .\n\"You are giving him a new platform and supporting his hate,\" says the petition .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Orson Scott Card, a science fiction writer known for his opposition to same-sex marriage, has been commissioned by DC Comics to write a two-part story for the new \"Adventures of Superman\" digital series.

{"question":"(CNN) -- With sympathy, grief and some outrage, Chinese netizens expressed their condolences over the deaths of two Chinese schoolgirls in Saturday's crash landing of an Asiana Airlines flight at San Francisco International Airport. Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, both 16, are the sole casualties of the ill-fated flight carrying 307 passengers and crew. They were part of a group of 35 teachers and students from a middle school in the eastern Chinese city of Jiangshan traveling to California for a summer camp program. The crash remained one of the top trending topics on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo on Monday, garnering over 1.7 million posts with the hashtag \"Boeing 777 crash.\" It was also the leading topic on Tencent Weibo, with over 240,000 posts. \"May you rest in peace in Heaven. God will forever be with you,\" wrote user HaiDianYuAiLiSi, one of thousands of netizens who took to weibo platforms to express sadness over the loss of two promising young lives. Many attached photos of lit candles or appended their posts with candle icons in a symbolic vigil to honor the two girls. \"These kids were so young. Their families are so pitiful,\" wrote user JinShuRenDouFuNao, echoing broad sympathy for the victims' parents. Some netizens also hit out at China's one-child policy for leaving the parents bereft of surviving children. \"Now that the child is gone, her parents' last hope is also gone. It's really heartbreaking. If they had two or three children, it would at least be a bit better for her parents,\" wrote user BianBaXianK. An official apology posted by Asiana on Sina Weibo sparked a debate over the qualifications of the pilot, with rumors rapidly spreading among Sina Weibo users that the plane was flown by an \"intern.\" \"Can an apology be exchanged for two lives? Asking interns to operate long-distance flights shows a complete disregard for human life. Even though tickets are cheap, you cannot treat people's lives like a joke,\" wrote user Kazumi Wawa. Asiana has announced that while the pilot was making his first landing with a Boeing 777 at San Francisco International Airport, it was not his first time flying to San Francisco. He has clocked 43 hours flying a Boeing 777 and piloted a total of about 10,000 hours, the airline said. As is often the case with social media, a handful of netizens displayed cavalier indifference to the victims, branding the girls overprivileged to be able to afford summer camp in the United States. A user named Yellow Submarine, who identified himself as a classmate of the victims, rallied, saying the trip \"was not a situation involving study abroad ambitions of wealthy people.\" 'Oh, Lord have mercy': Witness captures fatal jet crash . \"Jiangshan is a third-tier city with relatively low consumption levels and my classmates' backgrounds were not as privileged as some netizens think,\" he added. Chinese citizens comprised 141 of the 291 passengers onboard the flight.

{"question":"(CNN) -- A Swedish SWAT team backed by local police arrested four people overnight on suspicion of plotting terror attacks, the Swedish Security Service told CNN Sunday. The four were held in the city of Gothenburg for \"probable cause\" of preparing the attacks, the highest level of suspicion in Sweden, said Sara Kvarnstrom, a spokeswoman for the security force. She refused to say whether the suspects had been under surveillance or if the arrests resulted from a tip-off, saying she could not discussed details on an ongoing investigation. \"Through these arrests we have been able to prevent a situation from occurring,\" Malena Rembe, head analyst at the Swedish Security Service, told CNN affiliate TV4. Sweden is not raising its terror threat level -- which is currently at 3, with 5 as the highest -- and there is \"no reason for the public to be alarmed,\" she said. \"These arrests have not changed this threat level,\" Kvarnstrom added. An art gallery in central Gothenburg was evacuated shortly before midnight local time, police said, but declined to say whether it was connected to the arrests. A party was going on at the Roda Sten gallery at the time, with about 500 people attending the inauguration of an arts festival, according an interview with a witness in Goteborgs Posten, a local newspaper. The police cordon was removed at 6 a.m. local time, said Ulf Edberg, a spokesman for Gothenburg police. Police have a \"number of extra police officers\" on the streets of Gothenburg, Edberg said. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Hilding Qvarnstrom, said in a statement on the prosecution authority's website that the investigation is still at an early stage and authorities cannot reveal any details about the arrests. The head of the Swedish Security Service, Anders Danielsson, warned last week that \"Islamic terrorism is still the biggest threat against Sweden.\" \"But it is different today,\" he said, calling it \"more complex and unpredictable, both in terms of who could be a target and how they can strike.\" Al Qaeda is now encouraging Muslim radicals to stay home \"and strike where they are,\" rather than traveling to conflict zones to get experience, said Rembe of the Swedish Security Service. \"When individuals with those kind of ideologies act on their own it becomes harder to make a threat assessment,\" she warned. Stockholm was hit by a suicide bombing in December. The attack on the capital, Sweden's first suicide bombing, wounded two people in a district full of Christmas shoppers. And police arrested two people in Gothenburg, the country's second-largest city, on suspicion of plotting a bombing in October. They were later released without charge, police said. After the Stockholm bombing, Swedish Security Police said the country had almost 200 Islamic extremists who advocate violence, but said there was no indication their number is growing. The police study was commissioned months before the attack in Stockholm. The extremist threat isn't widespread, according to the report, which the government commissioned in February 2010. \"The threat from violence-promoting Islamic extremism in Sweden is currently not a threat to the fundamental structures of society, Sweden's democratic system or central government,\" the summary said. But the radicals are capable of damage, police said. \"While violence-promoting Islamist extremist groups do not pose a threat to Swedish society, they are still a threat to individuals and groups, especially in other countries,\" the report said. The police analysis highlighted the disturbing trend of increasing foreign travel by the radicals. \"The most serious potential threat to Sweden is the long-term effects of people from Sweden choosing to travel abroad to join violence-promoting Islamic extremist groups,\" the police said. \"There are currently no signs of falling interest in joining foreign groups.\" Swedish authorities are investigating involvement in radicalism by Taimour Abdulwahab, the weekend's suicide bomber. His emails before the bombings said that one reason for the attack was Sweden's tolerance of Lars Vilks' newspaper cartoon of the prophet Mohammed as a dog, authorities said. Abdulwahab, 28 -- who had lived in Iraq, Sweden and the English town of Luton -- also cited the presence of Swedish troops in Afghanistan. That cartoon of Mohammed, published in 2007, was also cited in the new report as an example \"of local events that may fuel radicalism globally.\" Sweden's radical networks are typically made up of males between 15 and 30 years of age, with varying backgrounds, most of whom were born or grew up in Sweden, the report said. Several women are also involved, sharing the violence-promoting ideology, but they don't engage directly in security-threatening activities, the police said. At least 80% of the radicals are socially connected, mainly through friendships and the Internet, but the social ties don't make them \"one coherent network capable of fully coordinating its resources and working towards the same goal,\" the report said. Swedish terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp said that before the December bombing, Sweden thought it was \"immune\" to terror attacks. \"Even (Osama) bin Laden said in early 2003, 2004, that if every country was like Sweden, there would be no terrorism,\" Ranstorp said. Police called upon civic leaders as well as the Swedish Muslim community to prevent and counter extremism, and they encouraged the public to develop a deeper knowledge of Islam. Though they shouldn't feel a greater responsibility to do so, practicing Muslims and their clerics could be helpful in countering \"violence-promoting propagandists active in Sweden and abroad,\" the report said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","target":"NEW: \"We have been able to prevent a situation,\" a top security analyst says .\nPolice evacuate an art gallery, but will not say whether it is connected to the arrests .\nA SWAT team holds four people in the city of Gothenburg .\nSweden's first suicide bomber struck in December, wounding two people in Stockholm .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Swedish authorities arrested four individuals in Gothenburg on suspicion of plotting terror attacks.

{"question":"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says relations with China are \"extremely important,\" but Beijing's demand for an apology and compensation over the detention of a Chinese fishing boat captain is \"completely groundless and is utterly unacceptable for Japan.\" The statement Saturday went on to assert Japanese jurisdiction over the islands where the captain was detained and declared that the dispute was handled in accordance with Japanese law. Zhan Qixiong was detained earlier this month after his trawler collided with Japanese vessels near disputed islands in the East China Sea. He was freed on Friday.

{"question":"Rome (CNN) -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi called into a television talk show Monday night during an episode discussing claims that he had paid prostitutes for sex, lashing out at the program's host for running a \"television brothel.\" The heated exchange with host Gad Lerner on the program, called \"L'Infedele\" (\"Unfaithful\"), ended with Berlusconi hanging up after a nearly two-minute tirade. \"I'm watching a disgusting show,\" Berlusconi said after being introduced, going on to call the program despicable, foul and repulsive before being interrupted by Lerner. \"Then, you've already insulted us enough,\" the host retorted. After more cross-talk during which Berlusconi appeared to ask Iva Zanicchi, a member of the European Parliament, to get up and leave the show, Lerner again asked Berlusconi to calm down. \"I beg you to moderate the tone of your voice,\" he said.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Thirty days of signs and signals have revealed to the world in Francis I, a pope who seems eager to earn the title pontiff, or bridge-builder. Beginning with his choice of a name, which evokes the beloved image of St. Francis of Assisi, the former cardinal of Buenos Aires, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, put the world on notice that change was afoot by forgoing the fancy red slippers and ermine stole favored by other popes. Since then he has shown a remarkable common touch in his encounters with the public and greater sensitivity to others than the man who came before him. Try as he did, Francis' immediate predecessor, Benedict XVI, never looked comfortable in his own skin, let alone in pastoral contact with others. Clad in his ornate robes, he seemed to keep the world at arm's length in a way that betrayed his long service as Rome's \"Rottweiler\" (a nickname he received from the press) in charge of disciplining those who deviated from doctrine. While personally warmer, the pope before Benedict, John Paul II, was stern when it came to religious matters and approached the world with an Us vs. Them mindset. As the church was rocked by a seemingly endless number of sex abuse scandals -- thousands of child victims and systematic cover-ups by the hierarchy -- he blamed secular society, especially the media, and capitalistic materialism. Pope Francis tasks cardinals with studying reform of Catholic Church . In contrast with John Paul and Benedict, Francis doesn't seem capable of greeting anyone without a big, sincere smile and whenever given the choice between clerical privilege and everyday human experience, he opts for the human. This was demonstrated most clearly as he visited a jail during Holy Week to symbolically wash the feet of a dozen people who represented the apostles. Among them were two women and two Muslims. Their presence, and Francis's ease with them, dismayed traditionalists who recoiled at the sight of females and non-Catholics being included in the ritual. It thrilled those who hunger for a more accessible and inclusive church. The survivors of clerical abuse, who I have come to know during three years of writing my book \"Mortal Sins,\" hope that Francis will bring real change. However, they have been discouraged by 30 years of church evasions and counterattacks and are understandably wary. Tough-minded evaluators, they criticize Francis' record on abuse in Argentina. There he was among many of the world's Catholic bishops -- fully 25% -- who failed to meet a deadline for establishing policies to deal with complaints and priests who were accused, according to the Wall Street Journal. Victims also wait for Francis to demonstrate that he will discipline offenders and reveal their records. \"We don't think statements make kids any safer,\" SNAP leader Barbara Blaine told me this week. \"Unless he makes kids safer, he's not doing his job.\" Blaine's \"show-me\" attitude is echoed by her SNAP colleague Peter Isely, who was sexually abused when he attended a Catholic boarding school in Wisconsin. Isely said he admires the new man's style and sees, in his personality, reason for hope. Vatican seeks to rebrand its relationship with science . \"St. Francis was the single greatest reformer in the history of the Catholic Church,\"' noted Isely. \"My favorite quote by St. Francis is, `Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible.' Confronting and reforming the church's global system of child sex abuse and cover-up, that is doing what is necessary. If Pope Francis does that, who knows what's possible? Better yet, what's impossible.\" Jeffrey Anderson, the attorney most responsible for the waves of litigation that have revealed the church's secrets on abusive priests, is even more optimistic. Regarded by some as the most dreaded enemy of institutional Catholicism, Anderson told me, \"This pope has already demonstrated in action and words a humility we haven't seen before. I see that as revolutionary and it is in direct contrast with the hubris that was the source of the abuse crisis. It gives me hope that he can, if he chooses to, go against the power structure and fundamentally change things. For today I have hope like I never had.\" Although I am also skeptical of church leaders and well aware of the hierarchy's long-standing failure on the abuse issue, Francis' first 30 days have led me to agree with Anderson when it comes to the new pope's personality. This is a shift for me, and I make it tentatively, because like all Catholics and former Catholics, I know we are susceptible to the influence of church stagecraft. We want to believe, and that desire has been exploited too often in the past. If Francis makes the changes that the church must make to end the sex abuse crisis, it will happen because he grasps and wields the power of his office. As a cardinal, he was bound by his oath of obedience to \"go along.\" As pope, he is the one who makes the rules and requires others to obey. What if one of those requirements included an open, transparent and serious program to make children safe and heal the trauma of the past 30 years? Pope to Vatican: 'Act decisively' on sex abuse cases . Many of history's transformational figures have been men who, when they finally achieved power, used it in surprising ways. Theodore Roosevelt, son of wealth and privilege, became the trust-busting enemy of corporate monopolists. Southerner Lyndon Johnson used his considerable skills to champion civil rights. Richard Nixon, Republican friend of industrialists, created the Environmental Protection Agency. Francis has his chance now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael D'Antonio.","target":"Michael D'Antonio: Pope Francis' first month has shown a remarkable common touch .\nHe says the Pope connects with people on a human level .\nEven those leading cause of church abuse victims like what they see, he says .\nD'Antonio: Pope has great opportunity to end the sex abuse crisis .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Pope Francis I, in his first 30 days as pontiff, has shown signs of being a bridge-builder and an agent of change within the Catholic Church. His choice of name, his rejection of traditional papal attire, and his warm, approachable demeanor have all signaled a departure from his predecessors. Unlike Pope Benedict XVI, who was seen as distant and stern, and Pope John Paul II, who was known for his us-versus-them approach, Francis has shown a remarkable common touch and a greater sensitivity to others. This was most evident when he visited a jail during Holy Week to wash the feet of a dozen people, including two women and two Muslims, a move that thrilled those who desire a more inclusive church.

{"question":"With domestic labor costs rising, many Asian manufacturing producers are now looking to relocate their factories in other regions of the world. Could Africa replace Asia and\/or China as the world's next manufacturing hub? To be sure, Africa has a number of manufacturing advantages that it has yet to realize. Besides low labor costs and abundant resources, these include duty-free and quota-free access to U.S. and EU markets for light manufactures under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act and the Cotonou Agreement. Is this enough to offset Sub-Saharan Africa's generally low labor productivity relative to that of its Asian competitors? Yes, if Africa can implement appropriate supportive policies to leverage its opportunities soon. This is the finding from a recent book by a team of World Bank economists. China dominates the global export market in light manufacturing, and its competitive edge far exceeds that of low income exporters that recently entered the global market. But steeply rising costs of land, regulatory compliance, and especially labor in China's coastal export manufacturing centers have begun to erode the latter's cost advantage, a trend likely to accelerate in the coming years. The ongoing redistribution of cost advantages in labor-intensive manufacturing presents an opportunity for Sub-Saharan Africa to start producing many light manufactures, enhance private investment and create millions of jobs. Read more: Brazil competes with China, India to invest in Africa . According to new evidence, feasible, low-cost, sharply focused policy initiatives aimed at enhancing private investment could launch the region on a path to becoming competitive in light manufacturing. These initiatives would complement progress on broader investment reforms and could foster industrialization and raise the market share of domestically produced goods in rapidly growing local markets for light manufacturers. And as local producers scale up, product will improve, and experience with technology, management and marketing will accumulate, allowing them to seize emerging export opportunities. In Sub-Saharan Africa, as in China and Vietnam, policies that encourage foreign direct investment can speed up industrial development and export expansion. Isolated successes can be multiplied, as with Ethiopia's recent foray into selling cut flowers in EU markets: a single pioneering firm opened the door to an industry that now employs 50,000 workers. Previous studies identified long lists of constraints, including corruption, red tape, inadequate utilities, poor transport and skills, inadequate access to finance, and so on. In contrast, the book proposes smaller, more specific, and sometimes newly identified constraints. Narrowing the analysis can make the reform agenda more manageable within the financial and human resource constraints of most African countries. Take the leather industry in Ethiopia. This sector employs about 8,000 workers and exported about $8 million in 2010, a fraction of similar countries in Asia such as Vietnam. Ethiopia's labor costs are lower than Asia's and the country has Africa's second largest cattle population, next to Sudan. Read more: Why Asian giants scent opportunity in Africa . Furthermore, climatic conditions mean Ethiopian animal skin is among the best in the world. Yet the most binding constraint is the shortage of quality processed leather due to poor disease control, lack of quality processing of raw hides and restrictive trade policies on processed leather. Once the problems are identified, the proposed solutions are straightforward. Treat ectoparasites (the skin disease that causes blemishes) at modest cost; allow imports and exports of raw hides and processed leather to help alleviate this constraint; and provide technical assistance. Some of these measures require changing existing policies. Others require provision of public goods such as industrial parks that could be inexpensive. Ethiopia's comparative advantage in wages, productivity, and natural resources has led the Huajian Group, a Chinese shoe maker, to build a factory in Ethiopia in three months, with two production lines starting in January 2012, exporting 20,000 pairs of shoes a month and creating some 550 jobs. So the opportunities and the preconditions are certainly there, provided African policy makers speedily seize them, as the book notes. But will Africa be the world's next manufacturing hub? Not likely. Manufacturing can be an unprecedented opportunity for Africa to industrialize and provide productive jobs to millions of Africans, especially young people who make up as much as 36% of the total working-age population; three in five of Africa's unemployed are under the age of 25. Read more: Is the West losing out to China in Africa? But the emergence of China as a powerhouse producing a variety of manufacturing goods at very cheap prices thanks to the large scale and skilful exploitation of the supply chain means that not all manufacturing jobs will be transferred from China to Africa. Due to widely varying country conditions, some African economies can take advantage of favorable wages and natural resources and benefit from taking timely measures to develop and export manufacturing goods. But large-scale production requirements also mean that some jobs will be transferred to countries such as India, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam while others will move to China's interior. In short, the invisible hand of globalization will work to ensure a redistribution of cost advantages to the benefit of the ultimate consumers around the world.","target":"Low labor costs and abundant resources are some of Africa's manufacturing advantages .\nRising costs of land and labor in China have begun to erode Beijing's cost advantage .\nAfrican countries can benefit from taking timely measures to develop manufacturing goods .\nManufacturing can help Africa industrialize and create jobs for millions .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Rising domestic labor costs in Asia are causing many manufacturers to consider relocating their factories.

{"question":"For years, China has talked about promoting \"green growth.\" But this probably isn't what they had in mind. For the seventh year in a row, monstrous quantities of green algae known as enteromorpha prolifera have sprouted in the coastal waters near Qingdao, China. But this year's growth, covering 28,900 square kilometers (11,158 square miles), is the biggest outbreak ever recorded, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. The previous record was 13,000 square kilometers (5019 square miles) in 2008. Swimmers and beachgoers were pictured frolicking among the stringy piles of slime, while bulldozers attempted to scoop it away. Chinese officials have blamed past algae outbreaks on unusually warm seas. Dr. Christopher Bolch, an algae expert at the University of Tasmania, says the explanation doesn't hold water. \"You may get faster growth rates with higher temperatures, but you can't get such large amounts of biomass without access to nutrients,\" he explained. According to Bolch, massive algae blooms feed off of high levels of nitrites and phosphates in the water, which typically comes from agricultural waste, industrial pollution, or human sewage from highly populated areas. Enteromorpha is \"fairly benign,\" said Bolch, but can harm marine ecosystems. Algae blocks sunlight from reaching aquatic life, reduces oxygen levels, and emits bacteria when the algae dies and rots. Similar but more dangerous types of aquatic growths, such as phytobacteria or dinoflagellates, can produce harmful toxins and posion people.  \"They should consider themselves quite lucky that it's not one of those,\" said Bolch. Chinese state media reported that the seaweed began proliferating on June 5, and that local governments had \"taken measures\" to minimize the impact to marine ecosystems. Officials reported that they had removed around 7,335 tons of algae. Bolch said enteromorpha typically does not cause health problems in humans, but \"large concentrations of anything can be problematic.\" There could be a risk of skin inflammation, said Bolch. \"If you were stupid enough to go in, I wouldn't go in naked.\" In 2012: Melting Arctic 'blooms' with algae .","target":"Coastal waters near Qingdao covered with 28,900 sq km of green algae .\nLargest outbreak seen by local officials, doubling previous record in 2008 .\nScientist says algae is caused by pollution and sewage in water .\nAlgae 'generally not harmful' to humans, but scientist urges caution .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"For the seventh consecutive year, China has experienced a massive outbreak of green algae, enteromorpha prolifera, in the coastal waters near Qingdao.

The debris of a second stage launch fell into the Philippine Sea after an object had entered orbit. \n  \n Another Seoul government source said intelligence indicated North Korea was producing long-distance rockets in a Pyongyang munitions factory and that South Korea had credible information Kim Jong Un had ordered the launch of a \"satellite\" to mark the 70th anniversary of the Workers' Party of North Korea. \n  \n Activities at Pyongyang Mirim Airport showed preparations for a large-scale military inspection by Kim Jong Un. Scud missiles, 240-mm rocket launchers, artillery, armored vehicles and transportation equipment had been assembled. \n  \n South Korea expects any launch around the Oct. 10 anniversary would be used as a provocation against Seoul. \n  \n \"We are closely watching the construction in Tongchang-ri,\" South Korean Defense Minister Kim Min-seok told Yonhap. \n  \n North Korea insists the site, which has audio, video and data connections to Pyongyang's control centers is for a \"peaceful satellite launch.\" |||||","target":"\u2013 Rumors of a new North Korea rocket launch are circulating again as government sources inform Yonhap news agency that the country has almost finished modifiying the Sohae Satellite Launching Station.

Laborers work on a construction site in a fishing village in Indonesia's Aceh on December 21. Hundreds of thousands were left homeless and jobless after the tsunami, and poor and isolated communities were left even worse off. Today, new schools have been constructed, and armies of workers -- many of them volunteers -- have cleared and rebuilt homes and towns, and helped get people back to work. \"The tsunami, despite being a horrific event, also provided a lot of opportunities for those countries,\" said Jonathan Cauldwell, chief of UNICEF's Tsunami Transition Support. \"It brought a peace dividend within Banda Aceh (Indonesia) where you still see peace in an area which had long term localized conflict in place.

Oxfam International, which said it will close its response to the tsunami at the end of December, said it has provided housing to tsunami survivors in Aceh, helped restore the livelihoods of people in India and Sri Lanka, and funded the reconstruction of eight tsunami-affected secondary schools. \"The money we received allowed us not only to help meet the immediate emergency needs of tsunami-affected populations, but also to try to address the factors that made them vulnerable: not least poverty and a lack of influence over their own lives,\" Barbara Stocking, chair of the Oxfam International Tsunami Fund Board, said in a statement. \"What has been achieved is astounding.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Early next month, Casey Rocheteau will pack up the belongings of her Brooklyn flat, say goodbye to friends and set-off for her new home in Detroit, Michigan. The \"Motor City\" was once regarded as the engine room of the U.S. economy but it has fallen upon hard times in recent decades -- or so the popular narrative goes. Now, a new venture which combines housing and the literary arts is hoping to paint the modern story of the Detroit in a more positive light. Rocheteau is the first person to receive a home completely for free as part of the Detroit Write A House program. The non-profit project is buying up and renovating foreclosed homes using crowd-sourced funds in the city's Banglatown district. It then gives them to promising literary prospects in the fields of fiction, non-fiction, screen writing, poetry and journalism among others. All Rocheteau has to do on her end of the deal is to pay fees for insurance and taxes, take part in local literary readings and promise to live in the house for at least two years. The-29-year-old originally from Cape Cod was selected by judges from a host of other applicants for the house on the strength of her poetry that \"breaks through\" and addresses \"some of the more frightening\" aspects of racism. While delighted, she says she is still pinching herself to make sure she's not dreaming and has actually won a new home. \"I saw this come up and I was a little bit skeptical as it seemed a bit too crazy that they were giving away free houses,\" Rocheteau told CNN. \"(But) I love the house and I'm very excited to actually get there and start living there. Laying the foundations . Write A House is the brainchild of Toby Barlow, a writer and creative director at advertising agency Team Detroit, and Sarah Cox, a writer and journalist originally from New York, who have been collaborating on the idea since 2012. The pair hope not only to improve Detroit's neighborhoods by filling out boarded up properties but to change outside perceptions of life in the city as well. \"As a freelance writer I've found it to be a great place as there is so much space to cover things. You're not living in a city like New York that has so many journalists in every area,\" Cox said. A problem that has arisen due to the comparative lack of storytellers in Detroit, Cox believes, is that negative stereotypes about life in the city have been allowed to flourish. Rocheteau concurs and points out that Detroit has become a metaphor for American industrial decline -- which she describes as wholly unfair. While Detroit has certainly suffered its fair share of hardship, including filing for bankruptcy in 2013, both Rocheteau and Cox say countering the simplistic narrative of a city in ruins is important in providing perspective. \"In Detroit there are so many stories that need to be told. It doesn't matter whether you end up telling them through poetry or fiction ... there's a lot of inspiring people here,\" Cox said. Moving on up . Tackling the many misconceptions surrounding Detroit and focusing on growing as a writer is for the months and years ahead, however. For now, Rocheteau is preparing to move in to her new home on November 1 and is excited to explore her new community. She said she was intrigued by the eclectic cultural mix of the neighborhood's Bangladeshi and Polish immigrant communities when she visited in September as well as the visual art installations that dot the landscape. The house itself is compact, with one bedroom and one bathroom, and was in a state of disrepair when bought at auction for just $1,000 earlier this year. It has since been renovated by local companies employing young apprentices from across Detroit thanks to a $30,000 donation from Team Detroit and $33,000 raised on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo. Write A House's initial success and the positive coverage it has received has also helped attract more donations and sponsors to buy up other houses in the coming months. \"We're planning to do three houses next year,\" Cox said. \"We already own one and are talking about picking up two more.\" She added that since the original crowdfunding campaign \"we have attracted grants ... and we've actually received $100,000 from the Knight Foundation (an organization that seeks to promote journalism and the arts).\" \"Crowdfunding was a great way to make it public and get attention by getting little donations. But the housing renovations are expensive and I believe we'll be getting a mix of different grants and funding in the future.\"","target":"Detroit project purchases and renovates foreclosed homes before giving them away to aspiring literary talents .\nFirst house purchased for $1,000 before being renovated and has been given to poet Casey Rocheteau .\nThe aim of the project is to fill in empty homes and boost Detroit's burgeoning literary scene .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Casey Rocheteau is the first person to receive a home completely for free as part of the Detroit Write A House program.

To help me find the best cure for myself, and in the process to produce substantial social change by redefining the word \"cure.\" But when I went home to publish my medical records, all I could do was send them to specialized professionals, either by duplicating the CDs and mailing them or by copying their closed format and uploading them somewhere. I had no direct access to my own information, since I use Linux and OSX rather than the files' Windows-based viewer. As a software engineer, I found software and programming tools to hack the files and make them open -- but a nontechnical person would have difficulty making use of their own medical data. I needed, first of all, something which I could easily share, maybe allowing people to open it from their browsers, or even from their smartphones. TED.com: New strategy in war on cancer . So I opened up my medical records and converted the data into multiple formats: spreadsheets, databases, metadata files in XML and video, image and sound files. And I published them on The Cure. The responses have been incredible. More than 200,000 people have visited the site and many have provided videos, poems, medical opinions, suggestions of alternative cures or lifestyles, personal stories of success or, sadly, failures -- and simply the statement, \"I am here.\" Among them were more than 90 doctors and researchers who offered information and support. The geneticist and TED fellow Jimmy Lin has offered to sequence the genome of my tumor after surgery -- in an open-source platform, of course. And the Italian parliament has been debating a motion to make all patients' medical records more open and accessible, which would be amazing progress in my country. Within one day I also heard from two different doctors, who recommended similar kinds of surgery. The first version is \"awake surgery,\" which monitors the brain in real time as different parts are touched. The second is a variation in which electrodes are placed on the brain during surgery, and then a brain map is produced (with the patient awake) and used during a second surgery (with the patient fully unconscious). TED.com: Your genes are not your fate . Existing portals and websites that allow patients and ex-patients to exchange stories and opinions already exist. But we're talking about something different. I see a cure as a dynamic process, in which multiple doctors, professionals, artists, scientists and others join as a society -- to converse, support each other, be open to various contributions and shape solutions that merge humanity, technology, technique, philosophy and art. Creativity and \"normal life\" become part of the process and bring \"diseased\" people back to life. To me, a true cure is complete, is human, and has dignity. And it never ends. Such a cure is a dialogue in which \"experts\" maintain their status -- and in fact, an enormous thank you goes out to all the extremely qualified professionals who are constantly responding to my calls -- but the whole process opens up to possibility. TED.com: The potential of regenerative medicine . And this is exactly what is happening: We are creating a cure by uniting the contributions of surgeons, homeopaths, oncologists, Chinese doctors, nutritionists and spiritual healers. The active participation of everyone involved -- both experts and ex-patients -- is naturally filtering out any damaging suggestion which might be proposed. To achieve this kind of cure, we must be open to strategies from different cultures and philosophical orientations. And we must embrace a wider, more profound discourse about the ways in which information circulates digitally. For now, I'm following a complex strategy developed with the help of a series of doctors and experts who responded to my open-source cure site and have suggested a variety of therapies to deal with the disease.

{"question":"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Quentin Tarantino's new movie \"Inglourious Basterds\" comes with a film inside the film, a Nazi propaganda movie promoting the glory of Germany's Third Reich. Eli Roth and Brad Pitt star in \"Inglourious Basterds.\" Roth also directed a short film within the film. Tarantino said he's not worried people might be offended by the short film, which is being promoted by a trailer that is now a viral video on the Internet. \"You would have to have absolutely, positively no sense of humor at all not to get it,\" Tarantino said. \"Stolz der Nation\" -- which translates into English as \"Nation's Pride\" -- was produced true to the style of Joseph Goebbels, Adolf Hitler's propaganda minister, but by Eli Roth, the director-actor who also plays one of Tarantino's \"Basterds\" known as the \"Bear Jew.\" \"There was something that we enjoyed immensely about the idea of a Jew making a Nazi propaganda movie,\" Tarantino said.  Watch Tarantino talk about how \"Nation's Pride\" was made \u00bb . Roth, well known for his R-rated horror flicks such as \"Hostel,\" said while growing up as a Jewish boy in Boston, Massachusetts, he never dreamed he would make a Nazi propaganda film. \"After 'Hostel 2,' I thought 'God, what can I make that's more offensive and upsetting than this film,' but somehow I did it with 'Nation's Pride,'\" Roth said. Roth viewed the black-and-white film as a character in \"Inglourious Basterds,\" a World War II fairy tale about a squad of Jewish-American soldiers who infiltrate behind enemy lines to terrorize the German army. Their plot to assassinate Hitler focuses on a small Paris, France, theater where Germany's leadership is gathered for the premiere of Goebbels' movie. The black-and-white film glorifies a fictional war hero played by Daniel Bruhl \"and the glory of the swastika and the power of Germany,\" Roth said. \"His courage was bound by duty. His legend was baptized in blood. His name will be crowned in glory,\" the trailer's narrator says as Pvt. Fredrick Zoller picks off dozens of American soldiers from a sniper's nest. \"Being Jewish, I wanted to make it a real propaganda film,\" Roth said. \"I was, like, I want to show what these movies are like. I don't want to do a sanitized version.\" Using just 20 extras and five stuntmen, Roth shot the five-and-a-half-minute film in three days in Gorlitz, Germany, the same town where \"The Reader\" was filmed a year earlier, he said. \"The whole time we were shooting, we were, like, not only does this have to impress Quentin, this has got to impress the Fuhrer,\" he said. \"Hitler has to see this and go 'This is your finest work.'\" \"The German crew were going 'God, normally, we can't do this. This is so illegal.' And I was, like, 'this is what they did,'\" he said. \"This is what Joseph Goebbels would have done, and this has got to be honest and accurate.\" While only parts of \"Nation's Pride\" are seen in \"Inglourious Basterds,\" Roth said Tarantino will likely include the complete film as a bonus on the DVD. \"Inglourious Basterds,\" starring Brad Pitt, opens across the United States on August 21.","target":"\"Inglourious Basterds\" features Nazi propaganda film .\nFilm was made by Jewish director Eli Roth, who also stars in \"Basterds\"\n\"Basterds,\" the latest from Quentin Tarantino, opens August 21 .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Quentin Tarantino's film \"Inglourious Basterds\" features a film within the film, a Nazi propaganda movie titled \"Nation's Pride\".

{"question":"Three students at the University of California Santa Barbara were being treated Thursday for meningococcal disease, a bacterial infection that causes bloodstream infections and meningitis, health officials said. The students -- two males and a female -- became ill between November 11 and November 18, according to the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. Two cases are confirmed to be the same strain, said department spokeswoman Susan Klein-Rothschild. The three were in contact \"directly or secondarily,\" she said. All the cases were caused by meningococcal bacteria known as type B, the same strain found in seven cases of meningitis, an infection of the lining of the brain, at Princeton University since March. However, no link has been found between the California cases and those at Princeton, the health department said. \"This is not expected, as cases of meningococcal disease can occur sporadically in college settings since this population has an increased risk,\" the department said in a statement. Generally, college-aged youth, particularly those in their first year who live in residence halls, are at increased risk of meningococcal disease. Kissing, sharing eating utensils or food, and drinks or cigarettes can increase risk. Public health officials and the university are looking into the cases. Some 300 students who have had close contact with the ill students were being given antibiotics, the statement said. Princeton is preparing to provide a vaccine, unlicensed in the United States, which targets meningitis B, pending final approval from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Santa Barbara County, UCSB, California Department of Public Health and Centers for Disease Control have already had preliminary discussions about the vaccine,\" the statement said. \"Santa Barbara County and UCSB will be monitoring the situation closely and continuing to explore the possibility of vaccination.\" There are two forms of meningitis: bacterial and viral. The bacterial form is rare in the United States, and the group B bacterial strains are even more rare. Symptoms can include stiff neck, headache, fever, vomiting, rashes, sensitivity to light and confusion. Untreated, the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment, brain damage, limb amputations and death.","target":"Meningococcal disease causes bloodstream infections and meningitis .\nThe disease is the same bacteria seen at Princeton University .\nNo link has been found between the California cases and those at Princeton .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Three students at the University of California Santa Barbara are being treated for meningococcal disease, a bacterial infection that can cause meningitis.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Eleven years ago this week, the world faced the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, a new epidemic that infected some 8,000 people, took the lives of 775 individuals, and inflicted $30 billion in damage to regional economies. The emergence of SARS was a wake-up call for the World Health Organization and its members, including the United States. The world had to do more to prevent, detect and respond to new biological threats. This is not just a health challenge; it's a security challenge as well. Infectious diseases -- whether naturally occurring, deliberate or accidental -- have the potential to cause enormous damage in terms of lives lost, economic impact and ability to recover, just as with nuclear, chemical, or cybersecurity attacks. During the anthrax attacks of 2001, 22 people were infected and five people lost their lives here in in the United States. The cleanup cost was more than $1 billion. The global H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 killed 284,000 people worldwide in its first year alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the decade since the SARS outbreak, we have made notable progress. China, for instance, has shown leadership in its transparent approach to the ongoing and rapidly escalating H7N9 influenza outbreak. Under revised WHO regulations, many countries have increased capability and made event reporting more transparent. But 80% of the world's nations still are not prepared to deal with new pandemics, and more can and must be done across the health, agriculture and security sectors to elevate this issue and steer resources toward it. The United States has made addressing infectious disease threats a priority. On Thursday in Washington and Geneva, we are convening 26 countries to launch a Global Health Security Agenda that will accelerate progress on addressing a wide range of global health security threats. With our partners and allies, we'll be intensifying our efforts to meet the challenges of an increasingly globalized world, whether that means the emergence and spread of new microbes, the globalization of travel and food supply, the rise of drug-resistant pathogens, or the risk of an inadvertent or intentional release. At the same time, we'll continue to work to prevent terrorists from developing, acquiring or using biological agents for harm. New diseases are inevitable, but in the 21st century we have the tools to greatly reduce the threat posed by global epidemics. We can put in place a safe, secure, globally linked, inter-operable system to prevent disease threats, detect outbreaks in real time, and share information and expertise to respond effectively. To achieve this goal, we must work more effectively across sectors and governments, harmonize our efforts, identify what works and measure our progress. We invite national leaders, international organizations and nongovernmental stakeholders from around the world to join us in this endeavor. Our security and the lives and livelihoods of our citizens depend on it.

{"question":"(CNN) -- There aren't too many times when I'm speechless about what I consider an outrageous example of parenting. This is one of those times. An Instagram photo surfaced over the weekend of a child wearing a Ray Rice costume and dragging a doll ostensibly meant to symbolize the wife of the embattled former NFL star, Janay Rice. (The person who posted the photo with the caption \"Greatest costume ever\" appears to have since taken down their Instagram account.) As most of us sadly know by now from the surveillance video that has been seen around the world, Rice dragged his then-fiancee out of an elevator after knocking her out in February. And so a kids' costume of Rice dragging his wife? Are you kidding me? Thankfully, some parents across the country have the words I can't seem to find. Halloween costumes to avoid this year . \"Utterly disgusting!\" is what Mike Heenan, a father of two young daughters and organizer of the SF Dads Group, called \"the seemingly celebratory suggestion of domestic violence in dragging around a Janay Rice doll.\" \"Not just insensitive. Idiotic! Dangerous! Disgraceful!\" said Heenan, who is also the founder of the blog At-Home Dad Matters. On Facebook, Alison Bucalo, a mom of two boys in Ridgewood, New Jersey, said she would never let her little guys wear something \"so tasteless.\" \"What's the purpose? To be funny? To shock? To show zero class? What is the lesson here?\" she asked. This Ray Rice costume for kids is just the latest example of what seems to be a trend in wildly inappropriate children's Halloween costumes, with selections ranging from meth dealers Walter White and Jesse Pinkman from TV's \"Breaking Bad\" to a baby cigarette to serial killer Hannibal Lecter. 5 scary good healthy Halloween treats . On the video-sharing site for tweens called KidzVuz, a girl who goes by the name \"citykid\" was horrified to see costumes such as a \"terrorist\" and a \"little Hitler.\" \"People actually made these for their kids to wear,\" she said incredulously. \"Just because it's Halloween that doesn't mean you can cross these kinds of lines.\" Well said, citykid. She also pointed out the growing popularity of oversexualized costumes for our girls. \"By making these costumes manufacturers are encouraging tween girls to dress twice their age.\" Melissa Atkins Wardy, a mom of two and author of \"Redefining Girly,\" said it is \"especially concerning\" when hypersexualized costumes \"dominate the girls market.\" Pink, princess-y and sexy too soon . \"It reflects a litmus test of our society and conveys the message to girls they are valued for their looks,\" said Wardy, who is also the founder and chief executive officer of PigtailPals & Ballcap Buddies, which offers empowering T-shirts for girls and boys. \"Instead of dressing like a true fire fighter\/super hero\/doctor\/bug\/witch, they face row after row of the sexy version of those things, size 5T,\" Wardy said. \"While a little girl may not understand what 'sexy' is, the older children and adults around her certainly do, and it impacts the way we talk to and respond to girls.\" Pam Moore, host of the blog Whatevs, said she's seen costumes such as a \"sexy mermaid\" or a \"sexy Starbucks beverage\" for children on Pinterest. \"Basically, anything that could be described as 'sexy' is inappropriate for a young girl,\" said Moore, who blogs about motherhood, fitness, home birth and life in Boulder, Colorado. As for how a parent can draw the line between what's inappropriate and what's OK for children to wear on Halloween, Moore, in my humble opinion, had some great advice. \"I would ask myself if this costume is getting a laugh at anyone's expense.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Marian McPartland, the famed jazz pianist and longtime host of NPR's \"Piano Jazz\" program, died Tuesday, her label confirmed. McPartland was 95 and died of natural causes at her Port Washington, New York, home, Concord Music Group said in a statement. McPartland had a career that spanned more than seven decades in music, first as a piano player in music halls in her native Great Britain during World War II and then in the jazz clubs of the United States. She's pictured in the classic 1958 Art Kane photograph of jazz musicians that became the basis of the documentary \"A Great Day in Harlem.\" \"I've played jazz as long as I could hear any. And I heard plenty in England before I came over here to America,\" she told CNN in 2004. She also frequently lectured at universities and served as a jazz disc jockey for a New York radio station. But she's probably best known for her hosting of \"Piano Jazz,\" the NPR show that began in 1979. The show was as gracious and casual as McPartland's fluid playing. \"It's so easy to make it a conversation, and you don't know where it's going to lead,\" McPartland once told NPR. \"The whole thing is so improvised, you really don't know where it's going to go.\" Her guests included a wide variety of musicians, including Dizzy Gillespie, Sarah Vaughan, Willie Nelson, Bruce Hornsby and Elvis Costello. She earned a number of honors for the show, including a Peabody Award, the Gracie Allen Award from American Women in Radio and Television and a Grammy Trustees Award for lifetime achievement. \"Our culture has lost a national treasure, and jazz music will greatly miss one of its most ardent and beloved supporters,\" the Recording Academy, which awards the Grammys, said in a statement.

{"question":"Kampala, Uganda (CNN) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni says sectarian and chauvinistic cultural leaders are behind weekend attacks by people, armed mainly with machetes and spears, who killed security personnel and civilians in the western part of the country. Police raised the death toll to 90 on Tuesday afternoon. Hundreds have been arrested, police said, including cultural leaders of rival ethnic groups in the Rwenzori Mountains region and in the oil-rich Lake Albert region bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo. Most of the dead \"are attackers killed in a counterattack at a military camp in Bundibugyo district and civilians,\" police spokesman Fred Enanga said. \"We have so far found 86 key suspects out of hundreds, and we continue with a cordon and search in the communities looking for 22 guns we lost. \"Most of guns were stolen at a police station and at a bank\" where there are police guards and private guards, he added. In a statement Tuesday, Museveni said the killings were the result of \"schemes of some confused or a selfish bunch of people,\" adding that 51 attackers and eight security force members are among the dead. \"On account of chauvinistic ideas being bandied around for so long, it seems some groups hatched this criminal scheme that has caused the deaths of so many people,\" he wrote. While the attacks were dealt with by the police and army, Museveni said, \"of course, there was a failure of intelligence.\" He asks: \"How did these people weave such a scheme without being preempted?\" Museveni says altogether, there were 13 daylight attacks across three districts in the Rwenzori Mountains and Lake Albert regions.","target":"Hundreds have been arrested, police say .\n51 attackers are among the dead, President Yoweri Museveni says .\nMany of the dead are civilians, and 8 security force members were killed, officials say .\nIn a statement, Museveni says \"there was a failure of intelligence\"","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has blamed sectarian and cultural leaders for recent attacks in the western part of the country, which resulted in the deaths of security personnel and civilians.

{"question":"Washington (CNN)  -- Look no further than the two warning flares shot up from Virginia and New Hampshire Tuesday evening to understand how concerned Democrats are about the political consequences of losing the late Sen. Edward Kennedy's seat to Republican Scott Brown. Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, called on his Democratic colleagues to suspend votes on their controversial health care legislation, warning it would be wrong to try to muscle a bill through Congress before Brown was sworn into office. \"In many ways, the campaign in Massachusetts became a referendum not only on health care reform but also on the openness and integrity of our government process,\" Webb said in a statement. Some 500 miles to the north, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley sent out an urgent plea for donations to help fund a special election next month for a state senate seat he fears losing. \"Over the past few weeks, radical right-wing activists turned Massachusetts into ground zero for the Tea Party movement, and we saw a taste of what's to come in 2010,\" Buckley wrote. Brown's victory has changed the political narrative in 2010. Weigh in on the election results . Traditionally, the president's party loses seats in the midterm elections. But now there is concern among some politically savvy Democrats who worry that the losses could be greater than originally anticipated in November all because of Brown's win. \"It makes it really hard,\" a senior Democratic operative, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Tuesday evening. \"The frustrating thing for (Democratic) members is that it was preventable, it affects them and it was something that never should have gotten to this point.\" In a matter of two weeks, Democrats witnessed a sleeping Republican base come to life to rally around a little-known GOP candidate, who defied the odds to win the race to succeed the liberal lion from Massachusetts. And after watching two governorships slip from their grasp in November, many Democrats have come to realize that the American public is not particularly happy with their stewardship of the nation. Democrats have 10 months to try to regain the momentum, but the wind is now at the Republicans' backs, and their first legislative victory will likely be slamming the brakes on President Obama's signature domestic issue: health care reform. It is a mighty blow for a president, who just one year ago seemed unbreakable, unstoppable, unbeatable. Brown is an unlikely savior for the Republican Party, which one year ago was disoriented, disorganized and disillusioned. A Massachusetts Republican has successfully brought together -- for the time being -- a party at war over the ideological purity of its membership. There is still discord in the GOP, but Brown's win gives Republicans another case study in how to run a successful campaign after their two gubernatorial wins in New Jersey and Virginia. Martha Coakley's loss provides Democrats with yet another example of how not to run a campaign after their earlier losses in New Jersey and Virginia. One of the biggest challenges for Democrats is wooing back independent voters, who broke Brown's way Tuesday to help him beat Coakley. \"If we don't figure out a way to talk to independent voters, we are done,\" lamented another high-level Democratic staffer, speaking freely on the condition of anonymity. Republicans wake up Wednesday morning with a new vigor, and GOP strategists vow to try to use this win to broaden a playing field that one year ago seemed unrealistic. The GOP's top target is Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who is in danger of losing re-election, according to public polls. But Republicans hope Tuesday's victory also convinces some fence-sitting Democrats to follow the leads of Dennis Moore of Kansas or Rep. John Tanner of Tennessee and choose to retire instead of running for re-election. For Obama, the loss will likely force him to reconsider his legislative priorities, as his support on Capitol Hill wanes in this midterm election year. Conservative Democrats are less likely to back him on controversial issues such as health care and cap and trade, fearing that to do so would be political suicide. After all, Republicans were able to win Kennedy's seat by running against the Obama agenda.","target":"Analysis: Many Democrats now realize public isn't particularly happy with their stewardship .\nWind is now at the Republicans' backs, and they may be able to put brakes on health bill .\nScott Brown's win gives GOP another case study in how to run successful campaign .\nFor President Obama, loss will likely force him to reconsider his legislative priorities .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Democrats are concerned about the political implications of losing the late Sen.

{"question":"(CNN) -- King of Clay Rafael Nadal began his defense of his Monte Carlo Masters title Wednesday with a routine 6-4, 6-3 victory against the Finnish player Jarkko Nieminen. Nadal, whose incredible form on clay has seen him go unbeaten at the tournament since 2003, showed little discomfort in dispatching Nieminen despite suffering persistent injury problems with his left knee. The Spaniard had pulled out of the Sony Ericsson Open semifinal against Andy Murray to receive treatment and also missed several tournaments after the Australian Open. \"I need practice, and today was a good practice,\" Nadal told AFP. \"Tomorrow (is) going to be another tough match against a player who is dangerous.\" That \"tough match\" will be against Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin. If Nadal wins it will be his 39th straight win in the tournament and put him on course for a record eighth title. \"It was the first match on clay after a long time, and the first match after 15 days without touching a racquet,\" said Nadal. \"The important thing was that I won in straight sets.

{"question":"(CNN) -- The man tasked with leading the police department in Sanford, Florida, in the wake of the Trayvon Martin killing said communities should \"take a good, hard look at who is selected,\" for neighborhood watch programs. But, said Sanford's interim Police Chief Richard Myers, he still supports the programs. \"Neighborhood watch is at work in literally thousands of neighborhoods across the country and with no problems whatsoever,\" Myers told CNN's Erin Burnett on Tuesday. \"I think the problems emerge from who the person is and perhaps there's a cause for communities to take a good, hard look at who is selected or who volunteers. \"Let's not kill the concept because of one bad, really bad outcome.\" Myers, a former police chief from Colorado Springs, Colorado, took the post Friday. He said he has plans to help the department that has been under the microscope since the February 26 killing of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Martin was black; Zimmerman is Hispanic. \"I'm here to help the community. There's a lot of healing that has to take place,\" Myers said. \"I'm here to help the department get some stability.\" His predecessor, Bill Lee, stepped aside as chief after a vote of no-confidence by city commissioners in April, clearing the way for Myers. The Martin case drew nationwide protests when Sanford police decided against arresting Zimmerman, who told investigators he killed Martin in self-defense. A special prosecutor assigned to look into Martin's death ultimately brought second-degree murder charges against the 28-year-old Zimmerman, who has pleaded not guilty and is out on a $150,000 bail. Myers, a 35-year law enforcement veteran, acknowledged the Sanford police department needs to rebuild its relationship with African-Americans in the area. \"One of my major goals is to try and strengthen the relationship that Sanford police have with all elements of the community, especially the African-American community,\" he said. \"In America today, there still exists a great deal of unresolved tension about race and policing and I have a particular passion for working on those issues and helping to resolve conflict. So whether or not that was a factor in this case, it certainly is a factor in some tension that exists. We're going to work on that.\" Myers began his career in the suburbs of Detroit and Chicago before becoming chief of the Appleton, Wisconsin, police department.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon will return to Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, for the second time in as many weeks on Wednesday morning, a spokesman for the municipal police department said. \"For security reasons, details are nonexistent,\" police department spokesman Jacinto Seguro said. Calderon will attend a meeting with local, state and federal officials, as well as civic and human rights groups, on Wednesday in Ciudad Juarez, which has been plagued by violence stemming from drug cartels. The January 31 killings in southern Juarez of 15 people, most of whom were students with no ties to organized crime, has sparked outrage across the country. The slayings, which occurred at a house party, are thought to be the result of bad intelligence by a cartel and the gang that carried out the killings. President Calderon, who has faced mounting pressure this month from Juarez residents to resign, will be visiting the city for the third time since assuming power in December 2006. Last week in Juarez, Calderon apologized to the families of the 15 people killed and promised residents that their input would form part of the strategy against drug-related violence. Residents of Juarez attempting to highlight the growing frustration with Calderon's war against organized crime took to the streets by the hundreds on Saturday. Many held signs targeted at Calderon reading, \"Assassin.\" On Tuesday, police said a business owner and his 24-year-old secretary were found slain inside a business near southern Juarez at 11 a.m. \"It's not new that the cartels target business owners, but killing his secretary, that's something that you don't see too often,\" Seguro said. Also Tuesday, 20 students found skipping class and drinking in the street were detained by police as part of an effort to curtail unlawful street activity, Seguro said. Violence in Juarez comes amid a backdrop of vastly increased numbers of homicides nationwide, as drug cartels battle each other and the Mexican government steps up its efforts to combat them. The government has not released official figures, but national media say 7,600 Mexicans lost their lives in the war on drugs in 2009. Calderon said last year that 6,500 Mexicans died in drug violence in 2008. Officials say more than 16,000 Mexicans have died since Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006.","target":"Calderon visited Juarez last week to discuss slayings of 15 people .\nLatest visit will be his third since taking office in 2006 .\nCalderon's resignation has been sought by residents .\nHe is leading a campaign to rid Mexico of drug trafficking .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Mexican President Felipe Calderon is set to visit Ciudad Juarez, a city troubled by drug cartel violence, for the second time in two weeks.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Iraqi police have won back full control of a ministry building stormed by gunmen who took civil servants hostage, the Interior Ministry and security sources said Thursday.

Police killed four militants, while two of the militants detonated suicide vests, the sources said. Two police officers were killed and seven injured in the attack. The hostages were freed unharmed. Police earlier said that the militants had overrun the Ministry of Human Rights building, adjacent to the Ministry of Transport.

{"question":"(CNN)It's safe to say Matthew McConaughey nailed it during his audition for \"Dazed and Confused.\" We already know the actor went on to become a superstar who immortalized the words \"All right, all right, all right,\" but thanks to the wonders of the Internet, we can watch the magic begin during his tryout for the film. A video of McConaughey's audition is making the rounds in honor of the Criterion release of the 1993 Richard Linklater film. There's the young actor looking majorly relaxed (he is playing a stoner, after all) and tossing off lines like \"That's what I love about high school girls, man. I keep getting older, but they stay the same age.\" Here are some other stars who also set out to wow casting directors with their takes on characters. Robert De Niro auditions for 'The Godfather' De Niro didn't snag the role of Sonny Corleone (that went to James Caan) in the epic film, but we suspect that director Francis Ford Coppola saw something he liked in the then-lesser known performer, as De Niro was cast as the young Vito Corleone in  \"The Godfather II.\" Scarlett Johansson's 'Jumanji' audition . Even as a little girl, Johansson had star power and beauty. She makes going out for the role of Judy Shepherd look effortless (though the part eventually went to Kirsten Dunst). Jimmy Fallon's 'SNL' audition . \"Saturday Night Live\" made him a star, and now he's a big-time talk show host. But years ago, Fallon used his celebrity impressions of stars like John Travolta, Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler to get his foot in the door. Chris Colfer's 'Glee' audition . Colfer slayed when he tried out for the role of Kurt Hummel. You can hear the delight in the room when he sings \"Mr. Cellophane.\" Gabourey Sidibe's 'Precious' audition . This one is pretty deep. Sidibe shows off her acting chops as she reveals, in character, that she is HIV-positive. Mark Hamill's 'Star Wars' audition .

{"question":"(CNN) -- Michael Schumacher's family has asked for privacy as the Formula One star remains in a critical condition in a French hospital following a skiing accident. The 45-year-old is stable but remains in a coma at the Grenoble hospital as he fights the effects of a serious head injury. Schumacher is a formidable figure in F1, winning a record seven world titles, and his plight has attracted global interest and an outpouring of support from the sport's fans. However his family wants the media to keep their distance. \"Please support us in our common fight with Michael,\" Corinna Schumacher, wife of the F1 racer, said in a statement. \"It is important to me that you [media] relieve the doctors and the hospital so that they can work in peace. \"I kindly ask you to trust their statements and leave the clinic. Please also let our family in peace.\" Schumacher suffered severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on 29 December. The German hit a rock hidden under deep snow and was catapulted head first onto another rock. He was not moving fast at the time. He is in a medically induced coma and has undergone two operations. His condition has attracted intense media scrutiny and last week a journalist disguised as a priest tried to sneak into the French hospital room where the Formula One superstar is being treated. The doctors at the hospital have also called for the media to provide more respect. \"The privacy of the patient demands that we are not going into details of his treatment, and this is why we do not plan any press conferences, nor give out written press releases, anymore for the time being,\" they said in a statement on Monday . \"We again insistently ask you to respect the medical secrets and to stick to the information given by the medical team in charge of the patient or his management, as this is the only valid information. \"The clinical state of Michael Schumacher is considered as stable and is constantly monitored by the medical treatments that are administered to him. \"However, the medical team responsible underlines that they will not stop to consider Michael's condition as critical.\" Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm added: \"I can confirm Michael's condition can be considered as stable, as written in the official statement. I cannot confirm to have stated that his life is out of danger.\" French prosecutors will reportedly brief journalists on their investigation into Schumacher's accident on Wednesday in the Alpine town of Albertville.

{"question":"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- It was not a quiet weekend for the prime minister of Japan, facing a diplomatic test abroad from China and questions at home about his leadership. Sitting down with CNN -- his first interview with an international television network -- Prime Minister Naoto Kan answered wide-ranging questions from pressing economic issues leading up to the upcoming APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit, to the diplomatic challenges from economic superpower China. Kan is a leader looking for a path out of a maze of domestic and international hurdles. He faces the monetary monster that is the sharply rising yen, that's prompting corporations like Toyota and Nissan to push production and jobs outside of Japan. Diplomatically, he is in the middle of a major test with China, a country wielding growing strength in the world economy, and a superpower that's just surpassed Japan in economic might. Japan is in an ongoing dispute with China over islands in the east China Sea. The islands, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, are claimed as territories by both countries. \"As far as Japan is concerned,\" said Kan, \"there is no territorial issue connected to the Senkaku islands. In fact, the Senkaku islands are the inherent territory of Japan. That is recognized in our history and also by international law.\" On September 7, the Japanese coast guard encountered a Chinese fishing crew in the islands' waters. The Chinese fishing vessel collided with two of the coast guard ships. Japan arrested the Chinese crew, quickly releasing the fishermen, but detaining the captain. His detention drew diplomatic fire from China, resulting in the cancellation of high-level ministerial meetings, most recently the abrupt cancellation of a scheduled meeting between Kan and Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Japan eventually released the captain, but relations continue to be strained. At the time of the September 7 incident, the Japanese coast guard captured both collisions on video. The video, deemed highly sensitive by the prime minister's office as it sought a smooth diplomatic out with China, was not released to the public, but shown to a select group of parliamentary lawmakers. Last Friday, the video appeared on YouTube and quickly went viral, sending Prime Minister Kan's office on the diplomatic defensive. Members of the prime minister's own party publicly began to question his handling of the matter. \"The fact that the video was leaked is a big mistake for the government,\" said legislator Hiroshi Kawauchi, of the prime minister's ruling Democratic Party of Japan. \"It is totally different from presenting it to the public in an official manner, and it leads (to) the people's further erosion of faith in Japan's government.\" In the weekend interview with CNN, the prime minister defended his actions. \"I believe in any country that matters that relate to its territory provoke strong sentiments among people of that country. But I trust five years, 10 years down the road, people then will appreciate my cabinet dealt with the issue in a calm manner.\" While the prime minister must try to contain the diplomatic damage with China, the most pressing matter in the week leading up to the APEC summit will be economic issues. Kan strongly defended his government's right to intervene in the currency market, in attempts to weaken the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. dollar. Japan had little choice, he suggested, since U.S. policy has been to boost the U.S. economy. \"With regard to the strong yen, the basic cause is the U.S. economy was undergoing changes with everything being skewed to a weak dollar,\" said Kan. \"Should there be excessive fluctuations in exchange markets, then we need to take resolute actions. In fact, we've already intervened in the market once. This remains an option we can take again.\" How long Kan remains in his job is a constant question lobbed publicly by many pundits in Japan. The topic is a natural one, as there have been five Japanese prime ministers in four years. Prime Minister Kan asserted he's shown leadership and results, producing a rare-earth minerals partnership with Vietnam and the deepening of an economic pact with India. \"As we move forward by achieving concrete results, one after another, these will become more visible to the Japanese people. I still have three more years in my term in office. If I firmly implement policies, I trust I will be able to have the support of the Japanese people,\" Kan said.","target":"Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan faces a maze of domestic and international issues .\nEconomic issues are at the forefront in the week leading up to the APEC summit in Japan .\nIn a CNN interview, Kan defends his government's intervention in the currency market .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan faces both domestic and international challenges.

Sanders' character, Bernie Sanderswitzky, rails against Larry David's character when he tries to get preferential treatment because he's rich. \"I'm so sick of the 1 percent getting this preferential treatment,\" Sanders says, alluding to one of his central campaign messages. David says that all sounds like socialism. Sanders corrects David, and replies, \"democratic socialism.\" \n  \n In the bit, Sanders' character also makes light of his Jewish heritage, joking that he'd change his last name, Sanderswitzky, when he gets to America, \"so it doesn't sound so Jewish.\" \n  \n SNL YouTube \n  \n Sanders' campaign played up the senator's appearance on Twitter. Near the start of the show, he tweeted out a fundraising appeal, with a Curb Your Enthusiasm reference: \"We need your vacuum pennies. Chip in a few,\" read the tweet, with a link to donate. \n  \n Overall, there wasn't a lot of Sanders' performance to judge. His cameo was definitely shorter than Donald Trump's a few months ago, and seemed to have even fewer lines than Hillary Clinton as Val back in October. After his appearance in the steamship skit, Sanders did return to the stage as David introduced musical guest The 1975. \"It's pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good,\" Sanders said when David asked how his campaign is going. \n  \n And at the end of the show, when the band plays and all the cast hugs and shakes hands, Sanders appeared again, soaking it all in, smiling.

Here are some things any military professional would observe: . \u2022 The uniform: All the attackers are uniform in appearance. All have vests capable of holding multiple magazines of ammunition for their weapons, and perhaps grenades.  Additionally, they are all wearing what appear to be heavy coats. That could indicate either body armor or possibly suicide vests underneath to be detonated if captured.  Some experts are suggesting \"they came to kill, not to die,\" but those of us with experience in these kinds of encounters might suggest they came to kill until they are trapped -- then they will willingly die if they can kill more by detonating a suicide vest as a last resort. \u2022 Use of weapons: The terrorists were wielding AK-47s, according to police spokesman Xavier Castaing, but at least one of them also appeared to have a military 3-point sling attached to the weapon (the white strap going over the shoulder).  These slings are used in close-in attacks.  The driver does not appear to have this strap, which allows for freedom in the car. The attackers appear to be good marksmen, as evidenced by the tight shot of a group of bullets that riddled the windshield of a French police car, shown in several photographs at the scene. Additionally, the attackers have their weapons on semi-automatic (single shot) versus full automatic. Many terrorists use what U.S. soldiers derisively call the \"pray and spray\" method.  That is, they point their weapons on full automatic, scream a religious slogan and let loose with a stream of bullets -- most of which don't hit the targets.  These terrorists appear well-trained, with aimed fire, single shots and controlled targeting. \u2022 Fire and maneuver: These terrorists appear to have been trained in movement techniques: They use cover (parked automobiles, or an open car door) and aim fire while their terrorist \"buddy\" maneuvers to a new firing location.  At that point, the moving terrorist aims and fires, while the previously covering terrorist moves to join him. \u2022 Reconnaissance: The attack occurred at noon in busy Paris, yet there was no traffic on the side streets where the citizens' filming took place. Additionally, initial reports indicate that an editors' meeting was occurring at that time, with all the subjects in one room. That indicates there was intelligence, route planning and then individual requirements for the members of the terrorist team. \u2022 Speed: They moved fast, knew where they are going, did their job, and then they were gone. Again, that's indicative of rehearsals but also single-mindedness of mission. \u2022 Selection of target: This was a follow-on attack. The offices of Charlie Hebdo had been previously firebombed, but that attack was not successful. Much like the initial World Trade Center bombing in 1993 that was followed by the 2001 attack, these terrorists were again going after the same target. Usually, terrorists film their attacks for future information operations and social media use.  They may have had terrorist videographers in specific locations for that purpose during this attack as well. Those videos may appear in the future, but until then French citizens posting YouTube videos contribute to the terrorists' information campaign. In the next few hours and days, other countries of Europe -- especially Germany and Italy -- will be interested in sharing information from this attack, as they face similar threats from Muslim extremists. France, the European Union and Interpol will share information, and given the ability of the terrorists to move freely through Europe, this passing of information will be critical. The passport-free Schengen Area allows for movement through 26 countries in Europe on the motorways and autobahns, so while initially this is an attack on France, these terrorists are a threat to all of Europe.","target":"Videos show speed, preparation by terrorists in Paris attack, Mark Hertling says .\nAttack's timing indicates intelligence and route planning on part of terror team, Hertling says .\nHertling calls it a follow-on attack after earlier firebombing on Charlie Hebdo failed .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo in Paris showed significant training on the part of the terrorists.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Doctors say Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is on her way to a full recovery after a blood clot was found in her head on Sunday night. She was discharged from New York Presbyterian Hospital on Wednesday after spending three days being treated, the State Department announced. Clinton's blood clot was located in the vein between the brain and skull behind her right ear, according to her doctors' statement. It is being treated with blood thinners and did not result in a stroke or any neurological damage. This type of blood clot is called a cerebral vein thrombosis and is relatively rare, said Dr. Mary Cushman, director of the Thrombosis and Hemostasis Program at the University of Vermont and chair of the American Society of Hematology's subcommittee on quality of care. A two-year study conducted in the Netherlands found cerebral vein thrombosis affects approximately 1 in every 100,000 people. In comparison, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 1 in 1,000 people are affected by deep venous thrombosis (DVT) -- a similar clot found most often in the leg. Clinton, now 65, suffered from a DVT in 1998. Anyone who has had a blood clot in the past is at a higher risk of getting one again. About one-third of people with DVT will have a recurrence within 10 years, according to the CDC. \"There are a handful of genetic conditions that predispose someone to these kinds of clots,\" Cushman said. \"That's why you might see two different (types of blood clots) in the same person.\" It's unknown if Clinton has a genetic condition that may increase her risk. Other risk factors for DVT include smoking, use of oral contraceptives, age (the risk increases over age 65) and obesity. Blood clots: 4 things you need to know . A large long-term study published in the journal PLoS One in 2007 found the more frequently a person travels, the higher their risk of blood clots. The blood in veins is fighting gravity to get back to the heart, Cushman said, and needs the leg muscles to help push it along. When a person is sedentary for long periods of time -- especially on a plane or in a car where the legs are in the same position for hours -- the blood can start to clot. Clinton has logged many miles as secretary of state, in addition to the time spent traveling as a former presidential candidate and first lady. Although she plans to step down from the State Department soon, there is a lot of speculation about a run for president in 2016. Blood clots wouldn't deter her from campaigning if that's what she chooses, said Dr. Jack Ansell, an expert in thrombosis at Lenox Hill Hospital who is not involved in Clinton's care. \"Travel is potentially an issue for the secretary, but I would imagine that when she travels she's not sitting in a coach seat, cramped up and sitting still,\" Ansell said. Experts recommend anyone with a history of blood clots stand up and walk every couple hours during long trips. They should also avoid alcoholic drinks prior to traveling -- dehydration can contribute to the formation of blood clots. Doctors often recommend wearing compression stockings, which help move blood along in the legs by narrowing the veins. Clinton may remain on blood thinners for several months or for the foreseeable future, said Dr. Evan Lipsitz, chief of vascular surgery at Montefiore Medical Center, who is not treating the secretary of state. \"The current recommendations are for at least three months of treatment with a blood thinner following a clot. Each case much be individualized depending on the size and location of the clot and the risk of bleeding as a result of the treatment,\" Lipsitz said. Often patients on these medications are monitored closely, having their blood checked once a month or every couple of months to ensure the dosage is right. Lipsitz makes his patients aware of typical blood clot symptoms (sudden pain or swelling in the limbs, or chest pain and shortness of breath caused by a blood clot traveling toward the lungs) so they can spot them and get treated quickly. Patients on blood thinners need to avoid physical trauma, Cushman said, but are otherwise fine. So while an NFL player or a construction worker would probably be out, Clinton's career going forward is still full of possibilities. \"I think her future is as good as her past,\" Ansell said. \"She should recover fully and get back to work.\" CNN's Mary Snow, Danielle Dellorto and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","target":"Hillary Clinton's blood clot is called a cerebral vein thrombosis and is relatively rare .\nAnyone who has had a blood clot in the past is at a higher risk of getting one again .\nIt's unknown if Clinton has a genetic condition that may increase her risk .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is expected to make a full recovery after a blood clot was discovered in her head.

{"question":"(CNN) -- We've been nearing the end of the late-fees era for years -- and, thanks to technology, we're one step closer this week. Amazon just launched a no-fees library loan program for digital books. This shift actually started more than a decade ago with the DVD-rental business. Or, more specifically, when Reed Hastings, now the CEO of Netflix (er, Qwikster?), forgot to return a copy of the movie \"Apollo 13\" for six weeks and racked up a $40 late fee from a video-rental store. That inspired his DVD-by-mail service, according to a 2006 essay in The New York Times, in which customers pay a monthly fee for the privilege to leave \"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion\" under their couches for as long as they'd like without financial penalty. Ba-da-bing. No more late fees. (Customers still gripe about Netflix's prices, though). Now, books are the next frontier. Sure, there have been previous no-tech attempts to waive library fees. Some book-loaners have programs called \"Amnesty Week,\" in which good-willed librarians let anyone return an overdue book -- no questions asked. Last year, someone brought a 35-years-overdue book back to a library during one of these events. The fine otherwise would have been $1,400, according to Time. In other cases, the fees to be charged were so hefty that libraries just decide to give up. In Oakland, Jim Pavon returned a 78-years-overdue copy of a Rudyard Kipling book, according to a 2005 story in The San Francisco Chronicle. \"Stunned library officials agreed to waive the late fees,\" the paper says, \"which under the 1927 rate of 2 cents per day would have amounted to more than $550 by now.\" Digital books allow for a different approach. Instead of charging owners for overdue e-books, the files just lock up on the borrower's e-book reader or smartphone. \"E-books automatically expire,\" said David Burleigh, a spokesman for a company called OverDrive, which is managing this library book-loaning program for Amazon and has apps that work for other e-reading platforms. \"So that definitely is a benefit from borrowing e-books. And you don't have to go back and forth to the library. You can do it remotely.\" That's good for forgetful types, who can stash books away from weeks or decades before remembering they've borrowed them. And it's good for libraries, too, since they can loan these books out again right away -- rather than waiting for them to be returned. \"It's fantastic,\" said Carrie Russell, director of the American Library Association's program on public access to information. The fact that libraries don't charge late fees on overdue e-books isn't a big deal, she said. \"Having been a librarian, the libraries don't really rely on late fees as a big budget boost,\" she said. \"It's negligible. It doesn't matter to us if we don't collect late fees. We'd rather the information gets out to people.\" Most digital book \"rentals\" last for two weeks. Libraries purchases a certain number of licenses for the digital books, and then lend those out to patrons. So it's not like the library can loan out 1,000 copies of \"The Help\" just because that book is popular. That's a good start, but is based on the \"print model,\" Russell said. In the future, she expects new \"Netflix models\" for books to emerge, where libraries pay monthly fees to publishers, perhaps, and can lend out as many copies of a book as their patrons would like. Amazon is in talks to do that for consumers, according to The Wall Street Journal. \"Customers would pay an annual fee to access a library of content\" under the potential plan, that paper says. The Amazon program is the largest so far, with 11,000 libraries participating, all of those in the United States only. That sounds like a lot, but it's only 9% of the libraries in the country, according to data from the American Library Association. The rest of the country may have to keep sweating overdue book fees. But perhaps not for too much longer.","target":"New program lets libraries lend e-books to Kindle users .\n11,000 libraries in the United States participate .\nThere are no late fees for the e-book rentals, but the files lock when they're overdue .\nTech has slowly been whittling away at the idea of late fees .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Amazon has launched a no-fees library loan program for digital books, marking a significant shift in the late-fees era.

The new program allows digital books to automatically lock up on the borrower's device after the loan period, eliminating the need for late fees. The program, managed by OverDrive, is beneficial for both forgetful borrowers and libraries, as it allows for immediate re-loaning of books. The program is currently available in 11,000 libraries in the U.S., which is only 9% of the country's libraries.

{"question":"(CNN) -- A U.S. military strike in southern Somalia Sunday was targeting Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of Al-Shabaab, the Somali-based group with ties to al Qaeda, according to three US officials. A drone operated by the U.S. Defense Department fired a Hellfire missile at a vehicle killing those inside, the officials said. But as of Tuesday, the Pentagon was unable to confirm whether Godane was killed, although he was the intended target. The military was authorized to try to kill Godane because of current intelligence indicating he posed an \"imminent threat\" against U.S. interests in the region, one official said. \"We have to be able to prove he was in the process of planning additional attacks,\" the official said. The official would not elaborate on what the intelligence might be. The officials confirmed this information in response to questioning from CNN, but declined to speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation. Officially, the Pentagon has only described the target of Sunday's strike as a \"senior leader\" affiliated with al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab. Godane has been a driving force behind Al-Shabaab declaring its affiliation to al Qaeda and has pressed for the group to launch attacks beyond Somalia. In recent years, U.S. officials had considered Al-Shabaab to be diminished in strength, but after the attack at the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya last year, officials have worried the group has demonstrated a renewed capability. The U.S. still sees the limited Western presence in Somalia as a potential target for Al-Shabaab, but the concerns also focus on U.S. targets throughout the Horn of Africa, the official said. U.S. officials are waiting for DNA evidence as well as intelligence gathered from local Somalis on the ground before they can confirm Godane was in the vehicle and killed by the drone strike. Somali officials have said the man killed was Sahal Iskudhuq, an Al-Shabaab operative who was close to Godane and involved in planning attacks over the years. The latest strike comes after a failed raid last year by U.S. Navy SEALS aiming to capture a man known as Ikrimah, who U.S. officials said was a senior militant with ties to al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Even as America reels from the horrific massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, the clock continues to count down toward the so-called \"fiscal cliff.\" In the face of a legitimate crisis, it is harder to stomach manufactured ones. And that's exactly what the so-called fiscal cliff is. In fact, every time I hear the term, I want to slam my head on the table. Luckily, I'm not alone. Today, December 19, a collection of artists are coming together to expose the \"fiscal cliff\" as a \"fiscal bluff,\" and remind progressives of the power of culture in helping to win the long-term war of ideas.

Some of the artwork takes the form of arresting and powerful visuals with a fierce message. Other works explain what is happening in Washington, or graphically depict the choice our nation faces. There are songs and videos touching on issues from student debt to long-ignored poverty. Not every piece frames the debate exactly as I would, and I may not share every artist's exact view. But that's not the point of a project like this. I believe this project conveys a message that policymakers need to hear. And it couldn't come at a more urgent moment than now, as reports indicate President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner could be nearing a deal that slashes Social Security, cuts benefits for veterans and raises taxes on the poor and middle class to pay for the Bush wars, tax cuts and bailouts. Our country is in the midst of a massive jobs crisis, the next generation is saddled in debt, the climate crisis is rapidly approaching a point of no return and now unspeakable gun violence shatters the heart of our nation. Instead of tackling these problems, some of our nation's leaders are apparently contemplating putting Social Security, and maybe Medicare, on the chopping block in a panic move -- all to avoid an artificially contrived deadline. We can make a huge dent in the rest of the deficit just by returning to the higher taxes and lower defense spending of the Clinton boom years, asking those who do well in America to do well by America. Washington should also deal with spending by cutting wasteful subsidies to oil companies, defense contractors and agribusinesses that do little but line CEOs' pockets with our tax dollars. The main part of the cliff that worries me is taxes going up on poor and middle-class Americans. The House of Representatives could fix that with one vote to extend the current low rates. We need to spread the word, and I am glad that artists are leading the way. Artists have been at the forefront of all great modern social movements. They inspire people to dream bigger, force us to imagine a different world and confront people with new ideas. We must embrace the power of art to better protect the American Dream for generations to come. We should never allow Washington politicians to stampede the American people into supporting cuts they otherwise would never accept. They're bluffing -- and hoping we fold.

The following morning, Deeds was stabbed multiple times during a fight with his 24-year-old son, who then shot himself with a rifle, according to autopsy results state police disclosed Wednesday. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Tuesday that the younger Deeds had been given a mental health evaluation under an emergency custody order. But Dennis Cropper, executive director of the Rockbridge Area Community Services Board, said that Austin Deeds had been released because no psychiatric bed could be found for him across a wide area of western Virginia, the newspaper reported. But three hospitals in the area told CNN Wednesday that they had beds available, and no one called them. All three are within an hour or two of the Deeds family home in Millboro, about 150 miles west of Richmond. Mental health: Warning signs parents can't ignore .

{"question":"(CNN)When the USS Kauffman steamed out of Norfolk Naval Station earlier this month, it marked the beginning of the end for an entire class of vessels in the U.S. Navy. The Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate will be the last of more than four dozen such ships to put itself in harm's way. \"I am honored and humbled to have this opportunity to lead such a capable and proud group of sailors on this, the final deployment of an FFG-7 class ship, and to be the last in a great line of frigate commanding officers,\" the Kauffman's skipper, Cmdr. Michael Concannon, said in a Navy statement. The final mission for the Kauffman and its crew of 250 will be to combat drug trafficking in the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility, the waters of the Caribbean and off the coasts of Central and South America. \"What a fitting mission for this great ship and crew to leave as its final legacy, keeping drugs off the streets of America by stopping them at the source,\" Concannon said. After it returns from the drug trafficking mission, the Kauffman will have spent more than 28 years in the U.S. Navy. It will be decommissioned in September and possibly put up for sale to an allied navy. The first of the Perry class, the USS Oliver Hazard Perry, was launched in 1976. The Navy once had 51 of the Perry-class ships, which were up to 453 feet long and displaced as much as 4,300 tons. They enjoyed a reputation for toughness, especially after two suffered battle damage in the Persian Gulf in the late 1980s. Perhaps the most famous of the Perry-class ships was the USS Stark, which survived a deadly attack in the Persian Gulf. Thirty-seven U.S. sailors were killed on May 17, 1987, when an Iraqi jet fired two Exocet missiles into the ship while it was on patrol during the Iran-Iraq war. Less than a year later, another Perry-class frigate, the USS Samuel B. Roberts, was struck by an Iranian mine, wounding 10 of its crew, blowing a 15-foot hole in its hull and breaking the frigate's keel, damage that almost always sends a ship to the bottom. The crew of the Roberts, however, was able to save the vessel, in part by using heavy steel cables to tie cracked portions of the ship's superstructure together. The Roberts was then loaded onto another ship, the Mighty Servant 2, in Dubai and transported back to the U.S., ship on ship. Both the Stark and the Roberts were eventually fully repaired and returned to the fleet. The Stark was scrapped in 2006. The Roberts completed what is expected to be its final mission in December, with its decommissioning planned for this year. The Navy defines the primary missions of frigates as protecting shipping and anti-submarine warfare. Those duties will be taken up by the service's new littoral combat ships, 20 of which are either in the fleet, under construction or under contract. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced last week that the LCS will succeed the Perry-class frigates in more than mission. \"Somehow, in the 21st century, we started naming ships with strange acronyms ... instead of from our naval traditions ... so we are going to change the hull designation of the \u202a#\u200eLCS\u202c\u202c class ships to FF (frigate) ... appropriate and traditional name,\" Mabus said in a speech to the Surface Navy Association's annual symposium. Those newly designated frigates will join the world's oldest active warship in the U.S. Navy's frigate fleet, the USS Constitution. Nicknamed \"Old Ironsides,\" the Navy's historic tall-masted showpiece was commissioned in 1797 and sails from Boston Harbor to promote the service.","target":"The USS Kauffman's deployment is the last for Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates .\nPerry-class frigates have been in the U.S. Navy for almost 40 years .\nIn the 1980s, attacks nearly sank two Perry-class frigates in the Persian Gulf .\nNavy secretary says littoral combat ships will be the new frigates .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The USS Kauffman, the last of the Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates, has embarked on its final mission to combat drug trafficking in the Caribbean and off the coasts of Central and South America.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Scotland's Andy Murray will face Roger Federer in the final of the Shanghai Masters on Sunday after both men eased past their semi-final opponents in straight sets on Saturday. World number four Murray powered past Argentina's Juan Monaco 6-4 6-1 in 85 minutes at the Qi Zhong center to reach his second straight final at a Masters 1000 event. Murray broke Monaco's serve early in the first set to open up a two game lead, but the South American refused to lie down, and when Murray double-faulted to squander his service game in the ninth game, it looked as though the Scot might drop his first set of the tournament. But the 23-year-old didn't panic and broke back instantly to secure the opening set 6-4. It was one-way traffic from there on in as Murray broke the South American's serve twice to comfortably secure his passage to the final. \"In each match I felt better. I feel like I move well on these courts and I can still get my serve through the court to get enough free points, Murray said after the match, AFP reported. Murray, who is looking for his second title of the season will face Roger Federer in the final after he beat Novak Djokovic 7-5 6-4 in the second semi-final. The record-breaking Swiss produced some vintage form to overcome Djokovic, who beat Federer in the semi-final at the U.S. Open last month. But it wasn't easy going for the former world number one as he took just over an hour to secure the first set. Federer had to save four break points in the fourth game to square up the set 2-2. And it wasn't until the 11th game that the Swiss was finally able to break the Serb's serve. Federer served out the first set and rammed home his advantage with an early break in the second, which was quickly followed by another. Djokovic claimed one of the breaks back but couldn't stop Federer reaching his fourth final of the season. Sunday's final is a repeat of the previous Masters event in Toronto in August. Murray won that encounter and currently holds a 7-5 career lead over the 16-time grand slam champion. Federer's semi-final win means he switches places in the world rankings with Djokovic, rising to second, behind current number one Spain's Rafael Nadal.","target":"Andy Murray will face Roger Federer in Sunday's Shanghai Masters final .\nScot beat Juan Monaco 6-4 6-1; Federer defeated Novak Djokovic 7-5 6-4 in semi-finals .\nFinal is a rematch of previous Masters tournament in Toronto which Murray won .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Andy Murray and Roger Federer will compete in the final of the Shanghai Masters after both won their semi-final matches in straight sets.

{"question":"Washington (CNN) -- As many as 2,000 additional troops -- including a number of U.S. forces -- may be headed to Afghanistan in the coming weeks under a plan backed by Gen. David Petraeus, CNN has learned. Petraeus has not commented publicly on the need for more troops, but a U.S. defense official and a senior NATO official directly familiar with his thinking and the entire matter have confirmed details to CNN. The proposal for more troops has been briefed to NATO officials behind closed doors. According to the NATO source, it calls for an additional 2,000 troops including at least 750 personnel to serve as trainers for Afghan forces. The trainers specifically would work to teach Afghan units how to support their operations in the field. The balance of the forces would work largely to counter the still significant threat posed by improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Another NATO official tells CNN \"it's highly likely\" many of the additional forces will be U.S. troops. Some NATO member countries are politically ambivalent about the war, he noted. And practically, it is only U.S. forces that have the most advanced equipment to counter roadside bombs . In May, Defense Secretary Robert Gates sent 850 U.S. military trainers on a temporary deployment when European countries could not pledge enough of their own forces. This latest need for 2,000 forces goes beyond that to include counter-IED forces, although some small number of the at least 750 additional trainers could replace those already there. No final decisions have been made on any additional U.S. troops. NATO military authorities are scheduled to meet in the coming days to try to get specific troop commitments from member nations. The goal is to get the matter resolved before a November NATO summit in which U.S. and NATO military commanders are expected to discuss progress in the war. It is not clear whether the new effort will bring the troop levels above the 30,000 additional U.S. forces authorized by President Barack Obama earlier this year, as it will depend on how many troops the NATO countries contribute and the potential re-assignment of existing forces. The president also authorized the Pentagon at the time to deploy 3,000 forces, but more than half of those 3,000 have already been earmarked. NATO sources emphasize they believe the bulk of the additional 2,000 will likely have to come from the US. The potential for yet another troop increase, even a relatively small one, is already being defended by NATO. The senior official told CNN \"this relatively small uplift -- less than 2 percent of the 150,000 in theatre from the coalition -- reflects the direction of the campaign: training the Afghan security forces to prepare for transition, as well as protecting our forces.\" A U.S. military official also confirms that in recent weeks the discussion of the \"withdrawal\" of forces from certain areas of Afghanistan beginning in July 2011 has taken a bit of a twist. The official said the withdrawal in some areas will signify that those areas may be turned over to Afghan control, but that may not mean troops will come home. The latest options call for taking those troops not needed and sending them to other areas where security is still poor.","target":"Sources say new troops would include more trainers for Afghan forces .\nNATO official: \"It's highly likely\" many of the additional forces would be U.S. troops .\nNATO authorities will meet soon to get specific commitments from member nations .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"A plan backed by Gen.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Kieren Keke remembers growing up on the Pacific island of Nauru, the world's smallest independent republic. \"The weather patterns were predictable,\" he says. \"There was a wet season and a dry season, an annual cycle. When there was drought, it was limited.\" \"Now it's different,\" he tells CNN. \"There's no predictability -- periods of drought can last seven or eight years, and when we get storms they are more intense. The coastline is being eroded. Now the sea is right up to people's doorsteps.\" Keke is now foreign minister of Nauru, and leads the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) at the current U.N. Climate Change conference in Doha, Qatar. The Alliance is fighting a David-and-Goliath battle with the world's biggest polluters -- trying to shame them into tougher action to limit emissions and curb the warming of the planet. Read more: Project to turn desert green trials in Qatar . The 43 members of the Alliance include countries that are literally disappearing amid rising sea levels. And they accuse the likes of India, China and the United States of not addressing climate change with enough urgency. The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2007 that sea levels would rise between seven and 23 inches (18 and 59 centimeters) this century, but a rate of ice-melt in the Arctic that is much faster than anticipated has prompted many scientists to raise the projection to about one meter, more than three feet. Among those most threatened are the Marshall Islands, halfway between Hawaii and Papua New Guinea. The highest point on the 29 atolls and five islands is 33 feet (10 meters) above sea level. The capital, Majuro, is just three feet above sea level and was inundated by high tides four years ago. Read more: Arab youth offers hope for Doha climate talks . \"Low-lying atolls across the Pacific are slowly vanishing,\" Keke says. In Nauru, too, people don't have many places to go. The island -- which on satellite imagery looks like a white pebble in the deep blue expanse of the Pacific -- is eight square miles (21 square kilometers) and has a population of some 10,000, almost all of whom live on the coastline. The highest point is 200 feet above sea level, but much of the interior has been ravaged by the effects of phosphate mining. And the nearest neighbors are some 180 miles (almost 300 kilometers) away. Keke says the Alliance wants the 190-odd delegations in Doha to \"ramp up their ambitions\" because current scientific projections about the warming planet will otherwise wipe out a number of low-lying states. But time is pressing. The Kyoto Protocol, the only binding international agreement on emissions, expires in less than four weeks. And the Doha conference is due to end later this week. Read more: Greenhouse gases reached record highs in 2011 . \"Some countries are ready to sign up for a second commitment period to Kyoto,\" which would last from 2013 to 2020, Keke says. Among them the European Union and Australia. But Canada, Russia and Japan are among governments that have already said they won't sign onto an extension of Kyoto, a stance that Keke says is \"very disappointing.\" They are demanding that countries like China and India -- now the first and third emitters of greenhouse gases -- to be bound by new targets, along with the industrialized world. China and India, as developing nations, were excused from the commitment adopted at Kyoto by some 40 developed nations to cut their carbon emissions by 5% by this year, compared with the level in 1990. Measuring sea levels among the Pacific islands -- and trying to establish trends -- is complicated by the effects of the weather systems known as El Nino and La Nina, according to climatologists. But beyond the threat of higher sea levels, the warming climate produces more extreme storms, and more acidic water bleaches coral reefs. Then there are the fish. Many of these island states rely on fishing to survive and as a source of revenue, but as ocean temperatures warm, fish move. Tuna don't like it hot and swim toward cooler, nutrient-rich waters. A paper prepared this year by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community forecasts that currents and changes in water temperature will mean that \"tuna are likely to move progressively toward the east\" -- away from the islands of Oceania. \"Traditional food sources and ways of living will be at risk,\" Keke says. AOSIS is asking U.N. officials at Doha not to allow this conference -- the 17th since the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 -- to degenerate into a last-minute take-it-or-leave-it declaration, as have previous sessions of the U.N. Framework on Climate Change. But these conferences have a habit of coming to life only when the main players turn up in the final days, and past meetings have led to shallow agreements that revised the process of negotiation rather than established real commitments. Whether Doha will be much different, and whether Keke and his colleagues from the Alliance of Small Island States will see a glimpse of hope on the horizon, may become clearer by the end of this week. At present they don't sound very optimistic, releasing a statement Monday that reads: \"We begin the final week of negotiations in Doha with the sober recognition that time is running out to prevent the loss of entire nations and other calamities in our membership and around the world.\"","target":"Lands in the Alliance of Small Island States are disappearing amid rising sea levels .\nThe Alliance is pressing for action at the current Climate Change conference .\nThe warming climate also produces more extreme storms and affects fishing .\nAlliance members do not sound optimistic about the conference .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Kieren Keke, the foreign minister of Nauru, has expressed concerns over unpredictable weather patterns and rising sea levels affecting the Pacific island.

{"question":"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- More than a dozen trucks loaded with fruits, spices and other goods Tuesday crossed the line dividing Kashmir as India and Pakistan opened a symbolic trade route in the disputed region for the first time in more than 60 years. Kashmiris watch as Indian trucks cross into the border town of Chakothi in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. To cheers and band music, the first trucks rumbled from the Pakistani side across a white bridge to a brightly decorated trade center festooned . Apple-laden Indian trucks heading the other way were also warmly welcomed. It is hoped the move will ease tensions in the troubled Himalayan region, which has been a conflict flashpoint between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan who both lay claims to the territory. \"Today, we have regained our lost market,\" said Ghulam Rasool Bhat, president of the Kashmir fruit growers' association.  Watch more about the historic day \u00bb . \"We are sending the sweet Kashmir apple as the first consignment. This is sure to sweeten the relation between the two neighbors. The beginning of the trade between the two Kashmirs will further improve the relations and lead to a peaceful resolution of the bitter problem,\" he said. The trucks were subjected to thorough security checks before they crossed the bridge, one of the few crossing points in the heavily militarized 742-kilometer (460-mile) Line of Control, the de facto frontier that divides the region. Kashmir has been a major source of dispute between India, and Pakistan since the two countries were partitioned at the end of British rule in 1947. Muslim Kashmiris sided with Pakistan to the north, while the Hindu south joined India. For the past 18 years, Kashmir has been wracked by a bloody separatist campaign. Authorities say up to 43,000 people have died, but rights groups and non-governmental organizations put the death toll at twice that. Violence had dropped off since the countries began a peace process in 2004, but it surged after the state government in Indian-controlled Kashmir announced plans in June to donate land for a Hindu shrine. Muslim protests following the decision prompted a government U-turn that triggered Hindu demonstrations calling for it to be restored. Subsequent violence left 40 dead and hundreds wounded. It is hoped Tuesday's route opening will bolster the peace agreement and combat lingering mistrust between India and Pakistan. A bilateral cease-fire has been holding in the region for more than four years. A bus service connecting the divided Kashmir began amid much fanfare in 2005 but struggled under the weight of elaborate security checks and stifling bureaucracy. \"This is a great emotional moment, as it brings to mind my grandfather, who used to drive lorries on this road,\" said Muzhar Hussain Naqvi, who drove the leading Pakistani truck.

{"question":"(CNN) -- It is the strange \"tail\" of Graeme Swann, his cat and a brush with the law that has made the England cricket team \"paws\" for thought before trash talking each other on Twitter. Swann, the world's top ranked spin bowler, appeared in court earlier this week charged with a drink-driving offence and it is the details that emerged during the hearing that provoked such mirth in England's dressing room. Nottingham magistrates court heard how the 31-year-old told police officers he had been to buy a screwdriver so he could release his cat who was trapped under the floorboards of his home. The trial was adjourned until October, but after the England team arrived in London to begin training ahead of the third Test with Pakistan, two of Swann's teammates joked about the affair on their Twitter accounts. Kevin Pietersen, England's flamboyant batsman, who was born and raised in South Africa, posted: \"2 hours with @Swannyg66 [Swann] this am and I'm still not having this 'cat' story!! Haha.\" A short time after, Swann updated his account by tweeting: \"Such a shame my teammates are so remedial in their 'banter'. Must be because they're all south African...\" Fast bowler Jimmy Anderson, who has nearly 55,000 followers on Twitter, got in on the act too. He tweeted: \"Swanny has turned up this morning with a tag round his ankle. Not sure what that's for.\" The players may have enjoyed their online banter but on the pitch England toiled on the opening day of the third Test against Pakistan at the Oval.

{"question":"Hong Kong (CNN) -- As Western companies hear the siren call of the Chinese consumer, they better heed the cautionary tale of Barbie. Mattel Inc. spent millions opening a six-story flagship store in Shanghai to great fanfare to bring the doll franchise to China in 2009. Two years later, it closed its doors. \"Barbie spent a lot of money setting up a boutique in the most fashionable part of Shanghai, where you could go and have all of your Barbie needs met. You could have a fashion consultation, you could of course buy lots of Barbie dolls,\" said Karl Gerth, author of \"As China Goes, So Goes the World: How Chinese Consumers Are Transforming Everything.\" However, \"they didn't think long and hard enough about whether Chinese girls wanted to look sexy or they wanted to look something closer to what you'd associate with Japan -- cute,\" Gerth added. \"So Hello Kitty is doing well, but Barbie is an example of crash and burn.\" It's a lesson in localization rather than grafting tried-and-true Western business plans to the Chinese market, \"On China\" experts told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. As China's ranks of consumers swell -- the number of middle class earners is estimated to grow 70% to 600 million by 2020 -- so too rises the stakes for companies looking to cash into China's growing consumer market. \"It's very important for the Western brands to not simply take an existing strategy or operations and try to take it into Chinese market,\" said Janet Wang, director of international business development for Tmall.com. \"You always have to be very flexible, be reactive to consumers' requirements and demands.\" One company that's done it right, Wang said, is Starbucks. \"They really localize their products to fit Chinese consumers' taste -- and not only the coffee itself ... they have pastry dedicated to Chinese flavors, (such as) dedicated products for the Moon Festival,\" said Wang, referring to traditional cuisine during China's Mid-Autumn Festival. \"They are trying to adapt their coffee into a traditional Chinese tea house. And it really blends the West meets East culture.\" One area where Western brands have some headway against their domestic Chinese competitors is product safety, in the wake of scandals over tainted baby formula, fake eggs and exploding watermelons. Shaun Rein said his company, China Market Research Group, interviewed 5,000 Chinese consumers in 15 cities last year. \"Their biggest concern in life, ahead of being able to pay education for their kids, or for medical care cost for their families, was food and product safety,\" Rein said. \"They're absolutely petrified of biting something and dying, or getting toxic shock syndrome from a toy. So what we've found is in these 5,000 consumers they trust foreign brands far more than they trust local domestic Chinese brands,\" Rein said. A dichotomy is growing in Chinese consumer trends between shopping for status and shopping for value. \"What that means is, people don't buy mid-level brands, which is why you see (brands?) like Marks & Spencer, or Li-Ning, or Gap kind of struggle, because these are branded for middle-class consumers,\" Rein said. \"What we see is people either shop for the most expensive things they can get, like a Louis Vuitton or Hermes bag, or they go for the cheapest.\" Still, there is a growing individualism in consumer tastes -- and a widening gap for new players to enter the market, the experts said. \"So for brand managers, now is the best time to come to China,\" Rein advised. \"Because people are no longer being monopolized by the same five brands. You know, you don't have to have a Omega (watch) any more -- now maybe you can buy something from Richemont.\" CNN's Kristie Lu Stout contributed to this report .","target":"As China's ranks of consumers swell so too rises the stakes for companies looking to cash in .\nAnalysts: Toymaker Mattel failed to cater to Chinese tastes for cute over sexy .\nCompanies often try to graft successful overseas strategies onto the Chinese market .\nStarbucks has succeeded in catering to Chinese tastes to grow its business .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Mattel's failed attempt to introduce Barbie to China in 2009 serves as a cautionary tale for Western companies looking to tap into the Chinese market. The company's six-story flagship store in Shanghai closed just two years after its grand opening due to a lack of understanding of Chinese consumer preferences. Experts suggest that successful localization, rather than simply transplanting Western business models, is key to success in China. Starbucks is cited as a successful example, having adapted its products to suit Chinese tastes. Western brands also have an advantage in terms of product safety, as Chinese consumers tend to trust foreign brands more following a series of domestic product scandals. However, a growing trend among Chinese consumers is to shop for either status or value, often overlooking mid-level brands. Despite these challenges, experts suggest that the growing individualism in consumer tastes presents opportunities for new players to enter the market.\n"}
{"question":"(CNN) -- While President-elect Barack Obama will certainly be making history when he takes the oath of office on January 20, he'll also be repeating it -- by placing his hand on the same Bible that Abraham Lincoln used during the inauguration of 1861. The 1861 Lincoln Inaugural Bible against the backdrop of the Main Reading Room of the Library of Congress. The Constitution does not require presidents to be sworn in on a Bible, though almost every chief executive since George Washington has chosen to do so. Presidents have differed greatly, however, on the question of which passage the Bible should be opened to during the swearing-in ceremony. It brings up the question of what -- if any -- biblical passage Obama will emphasize. If what is past is prologue, as Shakespeare famously wrote (a quote now engraved in front of the National Archives), he might opt for the popular presidential theme of repentance. According to Gleaves Whitney, a presidential historian at Michigan's Grand Valley State University, II Chronicles 7:14 was used for three swearing-in ceremonies: \"If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.\" In this season of economic distress, however, the president-elect may prefer to follow the lead of Franklin Roosevelt. When FDR first took the oath of office in 1933, the country was reeling under the crushing weight of the Great Depression. \"Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment,\" Roosevelt said in his inaugural address. Urging his fellow Americans to lend a helping hand, Roosevelt had the Bible opened to I Corinthians 13: \"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.\" Obama campaigned as someone who would strive to bridge the nation's bitter partisan divide. \"We have never been a collection of red states and blue states,\" Obama said in his Election Night victory speech. \"We are, and always will be, the United States of America.\" If Obama wants to stress that theme again on January 20, he may prefer to follow Bill Clinton's lead from the 1997 inaugural and open the Bible to Isaiah 58:12: \"Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations, and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach.\" Questions of war and peace are always in the back of any president's mind. Obama campaigned in part on a promise to end America's war in Iraq. Shortly after winning the White House on a similar pledge to end another divisive conflict -- this one in Vietnam -- Richard Nixon took the oath with a family Bible opened to Isaiah 2:4: \"And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\" With the polls showing an overwhelming majority of Americans convinced the country is on the wrong track, Obama might hint at a back-to-basics message by doing what Woodrow Wilson did in 1913. During his first inaugural, Wilson opened the Bible to Psalm 119, which concludes \"I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.\" Speaking of a return to basics, what about America's first president? What did George Washington do? Almost 220 years ago, in 1789, Washington opened the King James version of a Masonic Bible to Genesis 49:13 -- \"Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.\" Was America's first president trying to send a deep, profound message? Not exactly. It turns out that, for the nation's first inaugural, the Bible was hastily opened to a completely random page. The same thing was done 72 years later when Lincoln was sworn in. CNN's Brendan Polmer contributed to this report.","target":"Barack Obama will be sworn in using same Bible as Abraham Lincoln .\nLincoln's Bible was turned to a random page at his 1861 inauguration .\nMany presidents choose to open Bible to a specific verse .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"President-elect Barack Obama will be sworn in using the same Bible that Abraham Lincoln used for his 1861 inauguration. While the Constitution doesn't require presidents to be sworn in on a Bible, it has been a tradition since George Washington. The choice of biblical passage for the ceremony varies, and it is unclear which one Obama will choose. Historically, passages have reflected the current state of the nation and the president's intentions. For example, during the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt chose a passage emphasizing charity. Obama, who campaigned on a promise to bridge partisan divides, might choose a passage emphasizing unity. Alternatively, he could follow Richard Nixon's example and choose a passage about peace, reflecting his promise to end the war in Iraq."}
{"question":"(CNN) -- An Indiana lawmaker who opposes celebrating the centennial anniversary of the Girl Scouts of America says the group \"sexualizes\" young girls, promotes homosexuality and is a tactical arm of Planned Parenthood. In a letter sent to members of the Republican Caucus, Indiana state Rep. Bob Morris said many parents were \"abandoning the Girl Scouts because they promote homosexual lifestyles.\" \"As members of the Indiana House of Representatives, we must be wise before we use the credibility and respect of the 'Peoples' House' to extend legitimacy to a radicalized organization,\" Morris said, warning lawmakers not \"to endorse a group that has been subverted in the name of liberal progressive politics and the destruction of traditional American family values.\" In the Saturday letter, obtained by CNN affiliate WRTV-TV in Indianapolis, Morris lobbied lawmakers to oppose a nonbinding resolution celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Girl Scouts. Morris was the only member not to sign the measure. After doing what he called a \"small amount\" of research on the Internet, Morris said, he and his wife concluded the Girl Scouts have become a tactical arm of Planned Parenthood and are part of an agenda that includes \"sexualizing\" young girls. Morris' two daughters have been pulled from the Girl Scouts, he said, and instead will become active in American Heritage Girls Little Flowers organization -- a group that \"will not confuse their conservative Hoosier upbringing.\" Morris said he takes the stand despite the knowledge that \"99.9% of Girl Scout troops in this country\" are run by good leaders, he told WRTV. The concern, he said, is where the money goes on the national level. In a statement, the Girl Scouts said, \"Regarding Representative Morris, if the freshman representative wishes to discredit the contributions that hundreds of thousands of Indiana women and girls have made through the Girl Scouts program over the last 100 years, then he's entitled to his opinion. \"Not only is Rep. Morris off the mark on his claims, it's also unfortunate in his limited research that he failed to discover that since 1917, every first lady has served as the honorary leader of Girl Scouts, including Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush.\" Betty Cockrum, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Indiana, said she was disappointed in Morris' words, calling them \"inflammatory, misleading, woefully inaccurate and harmful.\" The controversy is the latest involving Planned Parenthood and its affiliates. The Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation briefly cut funding for some Planned Parenthood projects, saying it decided it would no longer fund groups under federal investigation. Congress in September began investigating whether Planned Parenthood illegally used federal funds to provide abortions. After Komen's initial decision, Planned Parenthood said money from the foundation has largely paid for breast exams at local centers. In the past five years, it said, grants from Komen have directly supported 170,000 screenings, making up about 4% of the exams performed at Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide. Karen Handel, a vice president with the Komen Foundation, resigned her position this month following uproar over Komen's actions. In stark contrast to his colleague, Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma, also a Republican, handed out Girl Scout cookies on the floor of the General Assembly on Tuesday. \"There are a lot of sideshows at the General Assembly ... and all walks of life, and you just have to determine which ones you're going to go into,\" Bosma told CNN affiliate WISH-TV in Indianapolis.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Many people thought that the massacre of 20 young school children and six educators by a gunman wielding an assault weapon would change the terms of the debate over firearms regulation. It appears that they were wrong. Not only does it now seem that Congress will not reinstate the assault weapons ban, but it also appears unlikely to place restrictions on the size of magazines so as to reduce the number of bullets that can be fired before reloading is required. For opponents of these measures, such a result would be vindication of what they argue is the absolute right to bear arms set forth in the Second Amendment. Such arguments ignore the fact that in its 2008 decision recognizing that the Second Amendment created a personal right to bear arms unrelated to serving in a militia, the Supreme Court also recognized the permissibility of \"reasonable\" restrictions on that right, including potentially prohibiting carrying \"dangerous and unusual weapons.\" For others, however, a legislative outcome that includes neither an assault weapons ban nor restrictions on magazines is just more of the same -- a powerful lobby using aggressive tactics to persuade Congress to ignore majority support for these measures. I must say, however, that if this turns out to be the result, I will be sad but hardly shocked. Gun bill filibuster? In 1978, while serving as the Treasury official overseeing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, we proposed regulations that would have created a centralized database of firearms transactions (which would not have included the names of individual retail purchasers). The purpose of such a database was to allow speedier tracing of firearms used in crimes and to allow the ATF to analyze the flow of firearms to particular dealers, which would suggest which dealers were diverting firearms to the illegal market. Even though these proposals would have had no effect on anyone's right to own any firearm, the NRA mounted a campaign against them, and Congress voted to prohibit any such database from ever being established, a prohibition that remains in effect today. During the debate over these regulations, I heard from some members of Congress that while the proposals made sense, politics precluded them from expressing support. Thirty years later, it seems little has changed. So given this state of play, what should be the focus of those who believe that added regulations of firearms would help save lives? Despite emotions, little happens legislatively after mass shootings . Obviously, a first step is to continue to make the case for an assault weapons ban and limitations on the size of magazines. The issue, after all, should be not whether such steps avoid all mass shootings, but whether they could save some lives. Would it not have been worth it even if some of those murdered in Newtown could have survived because the shooter did not have an assault weapon? But there are other things that can and should be done: . 1. We need to work to ensure that Congress at least finally creates a system of universal background checks for all firearms purchasers. Many people believe such a system exists today; it does not. Along with such a system, we need to improve the databases used in connection with such checks. 2. Focus should be placed on what is happening in particular states. For example, states such as New York and Colorado have made meaningful changes in gun laws in response to the spate of recent mass shootings, and other states have meaningful restrictions on firearms possession. It is true, however, that attitudes toward guns are different in different regions of the country. If certain states choose to have fewer firearms regulations, those choices should not be allowed to interfere with the policy decisions of those states that decide that a safer society requires more firearms regulations and fewer guns on the streets. Yet this is precisely what happens now where guns sold in low- or no-regulation states end up on the streets of those cities and states with far stricter regulation. Thus, we need -- as is being proposed -- to toughen the laws on \"straw man\" purchases and firearms trafficking and to make it a federal crime to transport a gun into a state where possession of that gun would be illegal. 3. Congressionally imposed restrictions placed on ATF's ability to enforce existing laws should be removed. This includes ending the ban on the creation of a centralized firearms transaction database, but also ending restrictions like the ban on ATF's ability to require gun dealers to conduct annual inventories to determine whether firearms have been lost or stolen. (Unfortunately we are instead seeing moves to make these kinds of restrictions permanent.) Opponents of new firearms regulations often argue that existing laws should be enforced before we pass new ones. Unfortunately, Congress is too often pressed to impose rules that make such enforcement less effective. Opinion: More gun mayhem, and yet we wait for action . In the end, a sensible approach to gun violence would, among other non-law enforcement steps, include prohibitions directed at assault-type weapons, more regulation of handguns, less regulation of traditional long guns and working to make sure that federal, state and local law enforcement have the tools to enforce the laws relating to firearms. Unfortunately, logic does not always operate when the topic is guns. What are your views on gun control? Share your thoughts . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Richard Davis.","target":"Richard Davis: Many thought massacre of 20 children, six adults would change gun debate .\nHe says we're seeing a predictable pattern in which gun lobby blocks popular legislation .\nSupreme Court decision on Second Amendment allows reasonable gun regulation, he says .\nDavis: Congress must create system of universal background checks for gun purchasers .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Despite the massacre of 20 children and six educators by a gunman, it seems unlikely that Congress will reinstate the assault weapons ban or place restrictions on the size of magazines.

{"question":"Doc to summarize:\n(CNN) -- Despite the obvious claims of younger rivals Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, few can really argue with the 96 football journalists who voted Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite as the 2007 World Footballer of the Year. Brazilian genius Kaka fully deserves winning the 2007 World Footballer of the Year award. The prestigious Ballon d'Or award is widely regarded as the most prestigious individual prize in football and Kaka's inclusion on its coveted roll of honor is a testament to the 25-year-old Brazilian's current standing in world football. When AC Milan defeated Liverpool in the Champions League final in Athens, avenging their heartbreaking loss to the same team in Istanbul two years previously, it enabled Kaka to fulfill his dream of holding aloft Europe's premier trophy -- a winner's medal he fully deserved after a sublime 90-minute performance. Kaka's stock for both club and country has risen steadily since his move to the San Siro from Sao Paulo for a fee of just $8.5 million in the summer of 2003. Unlike many a Brazilian sporting genius, Kaka did not hone his skills on the beach or the streets of a favela shanty town. He was born into a comfortable middle class Brasilia family, where football was not the only hope of a bright future. However, it soon became clear that this particular boy had a very special skill and he was signed by Sao Paulo, after his family had moved there, at just eight years of age -- making his first team debut as an 18-year-old. Kaka's progress was soon picked up by his national team coach and Felipe Scolari named the graceful midfielder in his 23-man squad for the 2002 World Cup finals, earning him a winners' medal despite playing only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against Costa Rica. A year later, and Kaka was on his way to Milan. Within a month he had made the starting line-up and his 10 goals helped the Rossoneri lift the Scudetto and the European Super Cup. Throughout his career, Kaka has always possessed the innate ability to score goals -- his record for both club and country sees him average roughly a goal every three games. Yet to describe Kaka merely as a goalscoring midfielder would be doing him a massive injustice. Tall, elegant and blessed with astonishing skill, Milan and Brazil utilize Kaka's ability superbly. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti soon recognized Kaka's genius, changing his team's system to a 4-4-1-1, playing the Brazilian behind a main target man. With Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso holding the central midfield area, Kaka has a license to roam in behind the lone striker, be it Filippo Inzaghi, Ronaldo or Alberto Gilardino. And Kaka does this with devastating effect, running at the opposition with pace and power, finding defense-splitting passes or shooting from range with deadly accuracy be it from a dead-ball situation or open play. The fly in the ointment for Milan comes in the shape of their poor form this season. Although they have already reached the last 16 of the Champions League, the club are floundering in Serie A and face the unthinkable prospect of not qualifying for next season's competition unless they win the trophy. Real Madrid have coveted Kaka for the last two years -- expect the world transfer record to be smashed if Milan don't secure a place among Europe's elite.

Kaka's career began at Sao Paulo and his talent was recognized early, leading to his move to AC Milan in 2003. His ability to score goals and his skill as a midfielder have been key to his success. Despite AC Milan's poor form this season, Kaka's performance remains strong. If Milan fails to secure a place in the Champions League, it is expected that Real Madrid may break the world transfer record to acquire Kaka.\n"}
{"question":"(CNN) -- \"Grey's Anatomy\" star Patrick Dempsey thinks he's just what the doctor ordered for a struggling Seattle-based coffee chain. Dempsey said he won the bid to buy Tully's Coffee, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October. The company, citing \"rising commodity prices and challenging lease economics,\" said it planned to close a number of underperforming coffee shop locations as part of its reorganization. Dempsey's company, which said it beat out six other bidders, including Starbucks, will pay $9.15 million for Tully's. \"It was a brand that needed to be preserved. There were 500 jobs at stake and it just felt right,\" Dempsey told CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront\" on Friday. \"I'm really excited about this.\" Starbucks, however, cautioned that the final determination certifying the winning bid for Tully's will not occur until a bankruptcy hearing next week. The coffee giant made an offer for some of Tully's assets, while another bidder made an offer for all other assets. The combined total of the Starbucks bid and the other \"back-up bid\" was $10.56 million, Starbucks said in a statement.

{"question":"(CNN) -- Voldemort did not die in vain. Ralph Fiennes may have dedicated a good part of the last decade to torturing Harry Potter, but he's also found the time, the energy and the clout to pull off his first film as director. By any standards, \"Coriolanus\" is an ambitious undertaking, a modern-day interpretation of one of Shakespeare's meatiest but less frequently performed plays. Although not everything comes off, Fiennes' bold, dynamic movie will make you glad he took up the challenge. Set in \"Some place calling itself Rome,\" but filmed, very tellingly, in battle-scarred Serbia and Montenegro, \"Coriolanus\" imagines a modern state rocked by food shortages and border disputes. Gen. Caius Martius (Fiennes) returns triumphant from vanquishing archenemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler) and the Volsces from their stronghold, Corioles, and takes on the name of this, his most famous victory. But an attempt to make him consul, or head of state, alarms some senators who know his contempt for ordinary civilians. While he easily carries the Senate, tradition demands that Caius, now known as \"Coriolanus,\" must also seek the assent of the citizenry in the public market. Too proud to court public opinion, he goes through the motions, but when his enemies turn the crowd against him, his fury only makes matters worse and the general is banished from Rome. Alone and angry, he swears vengeance and offers his services to Aufidius. As in other modern-dress Shakespearean adaptations, there are anomalies and eccentricities in this production, which brandishes guns and tanks but talks of swords and ultimately falls back on knife fights. The notion of the warrior-hero who can carry battles single-handedly doesn't really jibe with modern warfare, and it's been a while since we had a military man as president. Shakespeare's play leaves no doubt that however we value heroism on the battlefield, it's no qualification for success in politics. Coriolanus is undone by his own peculiar integrity, a refusal to exploit his war record for votes; but only because he finds the democratic process demeaning -- he's a pure elitist, the kind of person who believes that birthright is destiny. In power, he'd be a disaster. Not that the scheming, cynical professional politicians come out much better in this telling, or the fickle and easily manipulated populace for that matter. Politics is a dirty business, but Coriolanus betrays everyone he's ever known to uphold his own warped sense of honor. Head shaved, scarred, and often caked in blood, Fiennes is utterly compelling, a kind of Roman Rambo. We know he can play villains, but even if he's essentially a fascist, there is something noble about Coriolanus, and tragic, too, in his inability to bend or compromise. He is his own man, though we see very well that he's entirely the creation of his ferocious mother, Volumnia (a magnificent Vanessa Redgrave), and ultimately powerless before her. Substantially streamlined by screenwriter and playwright John Logan (whose scripts for \"Rango\" and \"Hugo\" also made it to the screen last year), Shakespeare's verse sounds a bit strange in the voice of cable TV newscasters, but the device works very well to convey background information and keep the action flowing. Logan has cut the play in half, but what it loses in detail the movie more than picks up in clarity and punch. Budget constraints probably account for Rome's surprisingly meager population and a Volsci army that seems to number about two dozen, but you can't argue with the talent in the foreground: Brian Cox, Jessica Chastain and Gerard Butler don't misplace a single syllable between them. This is Shakespearean acting of the highest caliber, and a powerful, bloody vision of \"honor\" gone mad.","target":"By any standards, \"Coriolanus\" is an ambitious undertaking .\nRalph Fiennes' bold, dynamic movie will make you glad he took up the challenge .\nFiennes is utterly compelling, a kind of Roman Rambo .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Ralph Fiennes, best known for his role as Voldemort in the Harry Potter series, has directed his first film, \"Coriolanus,\" a modern interpretation of one of Shakespeare's lesser-known plays.

{"question":"Doc to summarize:(CNN) -- Australian scientists have dated a star thought to be the oldest yet discovered, and it's right in our neighborhood -- astronomically speaking. The star, which has been given the name SMSS J031300.36-670839.3, is thought by a team of astronomers at the Australia National University to be 13.6 billion years old. The star itself is not a new discovery -- it is faintly visible on existing photographic maps of the southern sky. But the recent dating places it as older than any other celestial body previously found. The star is part of our Milky Way galaxy and only around 6,000 light years from Earth, relatively close in astronomical terms. Stefan Keller, a research fellow at ANU's Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, published the findings in the scientific journal Nature. \"Stars act as time capsules,\" Keller told CNN. \"This one took a little sample of the universe at the time that is was formed ... and means we can study [what the early universe was like] in great detail.\" The discovery of the star's age -- which dates it at only a hundred million years younger than scientific estimates of the age of the universe itself -- is significantly older than any previously dated stars. The oldest celestial bodies discovered thus far have been 13.2 billion years old. Keller and his team used the SkyMapper telescope to find ancient stars as part of an ongoing project to produce the first digital map of the southern sky. The team used a technique for imaging stars to ascertain how much iron was present -- the younger a star, the greater the amounts of iron it had. The SkyMapper telescope is unique in its ability to find stars with low iron, which uses sophisticated filters to measure the color of the stars, a key indicator of iron levels. \"The stars we are finding number one in a million,\" said team member Mike Bessell on the University's website. The team looked at 60 million stars and narrowed down potential candidates to a shortlist of 200, which were examined using the Magellan telescope in Chile. It is an important cosmological discovery, as it tells researchers a great deal about the origin of the elements that make up the universe. Keller said that most stars created in the early stages of the universe died in \"extremely violent explosions,\" and that it is unlikely that more stars of a similar age will be found.","target":"A 13.6 billion-year-old star has been dated by Australian astronomers .\nThe discovery of star's age makes it the oldest celestial body ever found .\nThe team used a unique technique for dating stars, based on the amount of iron present .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"Australian scientists have identified what they believe to be the oldest star yet discovered, named SMSS J031300.36-670839.3, which is estimated to be 13.6 billion years old.

{"question":"(CNN) -- It's been described as one of the greatest Victorian gothic horror stories of all time. Two ships with 129 men on board and fitted with the latest technology, vanish with barely a trace left behind. One hundred and sixty years of searching -- one attempt as recent as last month -- have failed to find \"HMS Erebus\" and her sister ship, the somewhat appropriately named \"HMS Terror\" -- the two vessels lost in the Arctic. In 1845 British Royal Navy captain Sir John Franklin set out with some of the finest sailors of the time on a mission to map the Northwest Passage. Franklin's expedition wasn't the first to the region, but it is the most infamous. \"Why did this fail when all the others didn't,\" asks author William Battersby. \"There was something jinxed about the expedition.\" Battersby is one of many to be transfixed by the mystery of Franklin's last voyage. \"We love adventure stories, of derring-do, win against all odds, but in this story they don't and we still don't know why.\" The environment of the Northwest Passage is unforgiving. The landscape is vast and deserted, comparable only to Jupiter's moons. The winters are unrelenting and bleak. Franklin's men were faced with particularly brutally harsh temperatures and blizzards when they reached the region. Despite the ships being reinforced with steel and holding three years worth or provisions, it appears the environment got the better of the crew. \"Man proposes, God disposes,\" says Bob Headland from the Scott Polar Research Institute, who regularly visits the region. '\"And the ice gods are a fickle lot.\" The disappearance of the Erebus and the Terror has prompted the longest search mission in history: Although there have been numerous attempts to find the ships, there has been no sign of them. Ryan Harris from Parks Canada led the most recent mission to try to locate the shipwrecks. Last month, his crews spent hours scouring the ocean floor, searching waters up to 50 meters deep. \"It's an incredible story. It's got shipwrecks, the remoteness of the Arctic, putting the might of English industrialism against Mother Nature,\" says Harris. Since 1997 Parks Canada has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars attempting to locate the \"Erebus\" and \"Terror.\" The tale of the Franklin expedition has enthralled Canadians -- the wreckage has the dubious honor of being the only national historic site in Canada that hasn't been found yet. \"Once Franklin received his orders that sealed his fate,\" Harris explains. \"In directing them south-west into ultimately the Victoria Strait it took them to the ice choke point. Once they fell into the clutch of that area, their fate was sealed. There's not much wildlife there and it is isolated.\" The last known account of the \"Erebus\" and \"Terror\" came in 1848. A rock cairn with a message on it indicated that the harsh conditions had already claimed their first lives, with only 105 men left alive. Franklin was one of the first casualties of his own expedition. That same year the men abandoned their ships, archaeologists believing they began making their way south in a desperate bid to find food. However the harsh environment supported little, and with few animals to hunt and over 100 men to feed, the chance of survival was low. It's been suggested that the men may have resorted to cannibalism in their last-ditch efforts to survive. \"There were far too many men to live off the environment. What man plans and what nature allows are two different things,\" says Headland. Archaeologists have relied heavily upon oral Inuit history to try to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Based on their accounts it is thought some of the men lived for another three or four years after abandoning ship. But questions remain over exactly what happened to them. In 160 years only two skeletons and three perfectly preserved bodies have been uncovered. It is likely diseases such as scurvy claimed many lives but Battersby believes it may have been the ships themselves that killed the sailors. His theory is that the men succumbed to lead poisoning derived from the internal pipe system used to melt ice into drinking water. It's hoped the discovery of the ships will provide answers. '\"There's a charm to the story,\" acknowledges Harris. \"By solving a mystery it takes the allure away.\" But having said that, Harris is determined the search will go on until the \"Erebus\" and the \"Terror\" are found. Parks Canada insists that their searches have not been futile and they'll continue to gather information to help with future efforts. \"I hope we're the last,\" says Harris. But after 160 years it's possible that this tale may be frozen in time forever. \"These are the last of the ghost ships,\" says Battersby. \"It is the world's biggest ghost story.\"","target":"In 1845 Sir John Franklin and 129 men set out on a mission to map the Northwest Passage .\n160 years of searching have failed to find the lost ships \"HMS Erebus\" and \"HMS Terror\"\nThe last known account of the expedition was in 1848 .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The HMS Erebus and her sister ship, the HMS Terror, two British Royal Navy vessels, disappeared in the Arctic in 1845 during an expedition to map the Northwest Passage.

{"question":"San Diego, California (CNN) -- And then they came for the children. Just when you thought Arizona lawmakers couldn't stoop any lower, these cowardly and shameful politicians grab a shovel and put in a basement. This fall, the Arizona legislature is expected to debate a bill that would deny birth certificates to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants -- the \"anchor babies\" that some Republicans have been trying to marginalize for years. The lawmakers are cowards because, first, they go after illegal immigrants who don't vote, lobby or contribute to political campaigns. And now they're going after children who don't vote, lobby or contribute to political campaigns. Whom are they not going after? Employers of illegal immigrants. You know why? Because they vote, lobby and contribute to political campaigns. By the way, the term \"anchor babies,\" which refers to the tots that supposedly increase the chances that mommy and daddy can stay in the United States even if mommy and daddy are in the country illegally, isn't just offensive and crude. It's also misleading. The fact that Elvira Arellano, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was famously holed up in a Chicago, Illinois, church, had a U.S.-born son didn't stop federal officials from deporting her in 2007. Some anchor. The real anchor is a job, the kind eagerly provided by U.S. employers who thumb their noses at federal law prohibiting the hiring of illegal immigrants. In fact, right-wingers acknowledge as much when they argue that if we dry up the jobs, illegal immigrants will self-deport. What about their kids, some of which were born in the United States? Why not stay for them? Simple: Employment takes precedence. Thus, according to conservatives' own arguments, there aren't anchor babies -- only anchor jobs. Also, you can bet that some of the same people who oppose citizenship for the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants also oppose the idea of granting a pathway to earned legalization -- what they call \"amnesty\" -- to illegal immigrants. Why? Because, they say, you can't willy-nilly convert those who are illegal to legal. Then how can those folks be so cavalier about making that conversion in the opposite direction by changing legal to illegal? Lastly, one of the things you hear from amnesty opponents is that illegal immigrants should certainly not be given U.S. citizenship. It's just too valuable, they say. Agreed. But if it's so valuable, then why are some on the right so quick to strip it away from the children of illegal immigrants? Don't U.S. citizens deserve more respect than that? Apparently not. In the late 1990s, the member of Congress leading the crusade against \"birthright citizenship\" was Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-California. The San Diego-area congressman proposed a bill to limit the privilege to the children of U.S. citizens. The legislation didn't go anywhere. It couldn't even get a hearing from some of Bilbray's fellow Republicans, who cringed at the idea of visiting the sins of the parents onto the children. The same was true for another failed attempt by Rep. Nathan Deal, R-Georgia, who, in 2005, proposed a bill that explicitly denied citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. The bill didn't go anywhere either, in part because not enough Republicans would even agree to give it a hearing. That same year, I discussed the idea with Rep. James Sensenbrenner, who was then chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and the author of a sweeping piece of legislation called \"The Border Protection, Anti-Terrorism, and Immigration Control Act of 2005.\" Among other things, the bill would have made unauthorized presence in the United States a felony. Yet even Sensenbrenner, not exactly a softhearted liberal, wouldn't touch the idea of denying citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. When fellow Republicans tried to insert such language into his bill, he was careful to keep it out. There was a time when Republicans knew better than to handle radioactive material. My, how times have changed. And now all the opponents of birthright citizenship have to do is change the Constitution. The 14th Amendment makes clear that anyone born in the United States, with the possible exception of the children of foreign diplomats, is a U.S. citizen. \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Grasping at straws, restrictionists and nativists claim that illegal immigrants aren't \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. So what? My concern isn't that critics don't know how to read the law. It's that they don't know how to read -- period. Jurisdiction applies not to the parents, but to the children. As U.S. citizens, they're subject to U.S. laws, but they also enjoy the protection of the U.S. Constitution. The closed border \/ closed mind crowd may not like it, but that's the way it is. I'm not surprised that this escapes the state of Arizona. iReporter supports the bill . Given all that's happened in recent weeks in its jihad against not illegal immigrants but Hispanics in general, the Grand Canyon State seems to have more than its share of people who slept through high school civics, and they're being advised by lawyers who were obviously absent the day they taught \"law\" in law school. That's not a good look. The U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants are legally entitled to U.S. citizenship. What part of \"legal\" don't the critics understand? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","target":"Arizona bill would deny citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants .\nRuben Navarrette Jr. says bill is shameful attempt to punish children for their parents' deeds .\nHe says Constitution explicitly grants citizenship to people born in the U.S.\nHe says many Republicans wouldn't back this kind of a bill in the past .","origin":"cnndm.csv","gpt4_summary":"The Arizona legislature is expected to debate a bill that would deny birth certificates to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants, a move criticized by some as targeting those who don't vote, lobby, or contribute to political campaigns.

They suggest the real \"anchor\" is employment, provided by U.S. employers who hire illegal immigrants. The article also highlights that some who oppose citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants also oppose granting a pathway to legalization for illegal immigrants. Past attempts to limit birthright citizenship have failed, and critics argue that denying citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants would require changing the 14th Amendment of the Constitution."}

conservative management resulted in complete healing without removal of device . \n skin fistula occurring after cied implantation can be managed in some cases without device explantation ; in fact , not every fistula implies an underlying infection , it can simply be related to a tension hematoma . \n the occurrence of tension hematoma predisposes to fistula formation and the fistula also predisposes to secondary infection ; accordingly , a case - by - case decision should be taken before explantation of device especially in dependent patient .","target":"skin fistula occurring after cardiac electronic device implantation is frequently related to pocket infection and this condition typically requires removal of device and lead(s ) . \n we report on a case of skin fistula occurring 3 weeks after internal cardioverter defibrillator replacement . \n conservative management consisted of local care along with oral antibiotics without removal of device ;

{"question":"(CNN) -- Investigators have heard a signal from the flight data recorders of the Yemenia Airways plane that crashed last week, they announced Sunday. Search parties continue their operation to locate the Yemenia Airbus A310 off the Comoros Islands Saturday. \"A signal was picked up from two acoustic transmitters from the plane's flight data recorders during a sea search to locate the data recorders this morning,\" the French air accident investigation agency, known as the BEA, said in a statement. Commonly known as \"black boxes,\" the data recorders should contain information to help determine what caused the crash. The Yemenia Airways Airbus 310 crashed into the Indian Ocean early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members. It originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, and went down just miles from Moroni, the capital of the Comoros Islands. One person, a 13-year-old French girl, survived. Bahia Basari, who lives in Marseille, escaped with cuts to her face and a fractured collarbone.  Watch teen survivor from crash \u00bb . The teen's father, Kassim Bakari, told a French radio network that his wife and daughter were flying to Comoros to visit relatives. \"When I had her on the phone, I asked her what happened and she said, 'Daddy, I don't know what happened, but the plane fell into the water and I found myself in the water... surrounded by darkness. I could not see anyone,'\" Bakari told France Info. The head of the rescue team in the Comoros told French radio RTL that the teenager beat astonishing odds to survive. \"It is truly, truly, miraculous,\" Ibrahim Abdoulazeb said. \"The young girl can barely swim.\" Another rescuer told France's Europe 1 radio that the girl was spotted in the rough sea, among bodies and plane debris in darkness, about two hours after the crash. The Airbus 310 plane tried to land at the airport in Moroni, then made a U-turn before it crashed, Comoros Vice President Idi Nadhoim said soon after the accident. A French official said the nation had banned the plane after it failed an aviation inspection in 2007. \"Since this check-up, we have not seen the plane reappearing in France,\" said Dominique Bussereau, the transport minister. But Yemenia Airlines was not on the European Union's list of banned airlines, he added. Passengers on the flight included 66 French citizens, 54 Comorians, one Palestinian and one Canadian, according to Yemeni and French officials.

{"question":"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama has accomplished some extraordinary things but can he really shoot down a fighter jet? The F-22 Raptor is the most expensive jet fighter ever built. The plane is the F-22 Raptor, a supersonic stealth marvel that looks like it's flown straight out of a Hollywood action film. It is being built for the U.S. Air Force, boasting the most advanced technology in the sky. \"You talk to any aviator in the world, ask what they would like to fly, and if they don't say the F-22 then they are lying,\" U.S. Major Derek Routt told The Atlantic magazine. \"I would kill to fly it.\" The U.S. government has ordered nearly 200 of them, even as the price has rocketed to more than $350 million each, making the Lockheed Martin\/Boeing F-22 the most expensive fighter ever built. But it's never been used in combat and it's not clear when it will be. The U.S. simply doesn't face any enemies with planes advanced enough to bother sending out an F-22. \"The reality is we are fighting two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, \"and the F-22 has not performed a single mission in either theater.\" Gates doesn't want any more of them. Obama, who campaigned for the presidency criticizing what he considers wasteful military spending, doesn't either. Is the F-22 essential military spending or a waste of money? Sound Off below . But it's the U.S. Congress that actually funds the military. A lot of its members want to see more F-22s taking off, to keep the U.S. air force ahead of potential rivals and protect thousands of factory jobs across the country. \"We need to maintain that air superiority,\" said Congressman Phil Gingrey, whose district is home to the main F-22 assembly line. \"This is not just about 2,200 jobs, although with the economy as it is, and all these job losses, it's kind of preposterous to think that this administration would close (them) down.\" The Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives has voted to order a dozen more planes.
