{"source": "### Instruction:How would you briefly describe the text?\n### Input:CNN's Don Lemon speaks exclusively with friends and family members about Michael Jackson's last days in \"Michael Jackson: His Final Days,\" 8 p.m. ET Friday on CNN. (InStyle.com)  -- One year after his untimely death, it's clear that Michael Jackson's legacy lives on. His influence over the worlds of music and fashion is still strong enough that Lady Gaga -- currently the reigning queen of the charts and an undisputed master in the Jackson-pioneered art of manufacturing buzz -- recently hoisted her own star even higher by announcing that she'd been asked to open for (and duet with) the King of Pop on his ill-fated \"This Is It\" tour. It's not surprising that she'd boast: Like virtually every other singer of her generation, Gaga owes an enormous creative debt to Jackson. And it goes way beyond the innovative role he played as a trailblazer of the music video (although Gaga's latest mega-efforts in that field certainly do credit to the form.) InStyle: Lady Gaga's most gaga outfits . Jackson was dressing in over-the-top metallic ensembles back when Gaga was still in diapers, and though the elaborate masked outfits she's worn everywhere from the MTV VMAs to her little sister's high school graduation may have a high-fashion precedent, they also call to mind the period when a paparazzi-weary Jackson began parading around Bahrain in a burka. Rihanna, too, has lately taken a few pages out of Jackson's book. Last week, an exec at her label announced that \"our bar for [her next] album is Michael Jackson's 'Thriller,'\" meaning they're hoping that every song on it is a hit. InStyle: Rihanna's best looks ever . She sampled his \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" for her song \"Don't Stop the Music,\" and she's been seen in a number of Jackson-esque garments, most recently a pair of shining ankle socks that strongly evoked his signature sequined pair. InStyle: Stars channel Michael Jackson's iconic style . But one would be hard-pressed to find a pop star who hasn't been influenced by Jackson's inimitable style: Usher dances in natty black and white and a very MJ hat in the video for his current smash, \"OMG.\" Justin Timberlake, too, has borrowed Jackson's sense of showmanship -- and, at times, his fedora. InStyle: Stars pay tribute to Michael Jackson . The rhinestone-laden jean shorts that Katy Perry donned for her new \"California Gurls\" clip call Jackson to mind -- he loved to add improbable amounts of glitz to quotidian items, like jackets, shirts, and (again) socks. And the shining metallic ornament Beyonce wore on her left hand throughout the \"Single Ladies\" era seemed inspired, in part, by Jackson's single glove. Even eleven-year-old actor Jaden Smith -- who was born well after the King of Pop's heyday (and is himself the spawn of another musician, former Fresh Prince Will Smith) -- recently pledged allegiance to Jackson's style: At the June 10th premiere of his film \"The Karate Kid,\" he walked the red carpet in black pants, a crisp white shirt and a carbon copy of Jackson's red-and-black leather \"Thriller\" jacket.

{"source": "### Instruction: Can you walk me through the main ideas?(CNN) -- It's been described as one of the greatest Victorian gothic horror stories of all time. Two ships with 129 men on board and fitted with the latest technology, vanish with barely a trace left behind. One hundred and sixty years of searching -- one attempt as recent as last month -- have failed to find \"HMS Erebus\" and her sister ship, the somewhat appropriately named \"HMS Terror\" -- the two vessels lost in the Arctic. In 1845 British Royal Navy captain Sir John Franklin set out with some of the finest sailors of the time on a mission to map the Northwest Passage. Franklin's expedition wasn't the first to the region, but it is the most infamous. \"Why did this fail when all the others didn't,\" asks author William Battersby. \"There was something jinxed about the expedition.\" Battersby is one of many to be transfixed by the mystery of Franklin's last voyage. \"We love adventure stories, of derring-do, win against all odds, but in this story they don't and we still don't know why.\" The environment of the Northwest Passage is unforgiving. The landscape is vast and deserted, comparable only to Jupiter's moons. The winters are unrelenting and bleak. Franklin's men were faced with particularly brutally harsh temperatures and blizzards when they reached the region. Despite the ships being reinforced with steel and holding three years worth or provisions, it appears the environment got the better of the crew. \"Man proposes, God disposes,\" says Bob Headland from the Scott Polar Research Institute, who regularly visits the region. '\"And the ice gods are a fickle lot.\" The disappearance of the Erebus and the Terror has prompted the longest search mission in history: Although there have been numerous attempts to find the ships, there has been no sign of them. Ryan Harris from Parks Canada led the most recent mission to try to locate the shipwrecks. Last month, his crews spent hours scouring the ocean floor, searching waters up to 50 meters deep. \"It's an incredible story. It's got shipwrecks, the remoteness of the Arctic, putting the might of English industrialism against Mother Nature,\" says Harris. Since 1997 Parks Canada has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars attempting to locate the \"Erebus\" and \"Terror.\" The tale of the Franklin expedition has enthralled Canadians -- the wreckage has the dubious honor of being the only national historic site in Canada that hasn't been found yet. \"Once Franklin received his orders that sealed his fate,\" Harris explains. \"In directing them south-west into ultimately the Victoria Strait it took them to the ice choke point. Once they fell into the clutch of that area, their fate was sealed. There's not much wildlife there and it is isolated.\" The last known account of the \"Erebus\" and \"Terror\" came in 1848. A rock cairn with a message on it indicated that the harsh conditions had already claimed their first lives, with only 105 men left alive. Franklin was one of the first casualties of his own expedition. That same year the men abandoned their ships, archaeologists believing they began making their way south in a desperate bid to find food. However the harsh environment supported little, and with few animals to hunt and over 100 men to feed, the chance of survival was low. It's been suggested that the men may have resorted to cannibalism in their last-ditch efforts to survive. \"There were far too many men to live off the environment. What man plans and what nature allows are two different things,\" says Headland. Archaeologists have relied heavily upon oral Inuit history to try to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Based on their accounts it is thought some of the men lived for another three or four years after abandoning ship. But questions remain over exactly what happened to them. In 160 years only two skeletons and three perfectly preserved bodies have been uncovered. It is likely diseases such as scurvy claimed many lives but Battersby believes it may have been the ships themselves that killed the sailors. His theory is that the men succumbed to lead poisoning derived from the internal pipe system used to melt ice into drinking water. It's hoped the discovery of the ships will provide answers. '\"There's a charm to the story,\" acknowledges Harris. \"By solving a mystery it takes the allure away.\" But having said that, Harris is determined the search will go on until the \"Erebus\" and the \"Terror\" are found. Parks Canada insists that their searches have not been futile and they'll continue to gather information to help with future efforts. \"I hope we're the last,\" says Harris. But after 160 years it's possible that this tale may be frozen in time forever. \"These are the last of the ghost ships,\" says Battersby. \"It is the world's biggest ghost story.\"\n### Response :", "target": "In 1845 Sir John Franklin and 129 men set out on a mission to map the Northwest Passage .\n160 years of searching have failed to find the lost ships \"HMS Erebus\" and \"HMS Terror\"\nThe last known account of the expedition was in 1848 .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.(CNN) -- All eyes this week are on North Korea, which looks set to move forward with a provocative long-range missile launch. Last month, Pyongyang announced it would launch a rocket carrying a satellite sometime between Thursday and April 16 to mark the 100th anniversary of its founder, Kim Il Sung. Japan, the United States and South Korea see the launch -- which would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions -- as a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test. And a South Korean intelligence report says it's likely to precede a nuclear test, as it did in 2006 and 2009. Pyongyang insists its intentions are good and have invited foreign journalists, including CNN correspondent Stan Grant, to view the secret launch site. CNN on Monday interviewed Jim Walsh, an international security analyst from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on \"Starting Point\" to help explain the tense situation: . CNN: This whole parading the journalists through -- letting people see -- is this Kim Jong Un bragging internally? Is it sending a message to the international community? Both? Jim Walsh: It's a good question. Often when North Korea acts out, its purpose is to communicate with the broader world, communicate to the United States or to Japan or South Korea. This is really about internal messaging, being able to go to its own public and say, \"Look, all these Western journalists are here, we're really important, we're really a big deal.\" And why do I say it's internally driven? Because they are going through a political transition. This young guy, this 20-something-year-old, has taken over for his father (Kim Jong Il), and he's in the middle of trying to consolidate his position. And it's the 100th anniversary of Kim Il Sung's birth. ... They've been planning big events for years now for this. So this is all about regime legitimacy and talking to the North Korean people and the military, the elites in the military. CNN: CNN saw what appears to be a satellite. I think most of the media there agree that there definitely is a satellite for this rocket, to launch this satellite into space. ... We also know that this is a country that has nuclear ambitions, no matter how nascent it is or successful it might be. Walsh: Yes, well, you know, this missile is not the greatest missile in the world. There are two characteristics if you have a modern missile program: One is solid fuel, and the other is a modern-guidance system. This missile has neither of those. And four tests, four long-range missile tests over like 15 years, is not a very active missile program. It's more like a tube filled with gasoline than it is anything else. The big worry is they're going to fire it up there, and it will get wobbly on them and start to veer off course like the last two did. That's the real concern I have: not the missile itself but that the missile might stray into foreign airspace and that Japan or South Korea might feel inclined to shoot it down and then suddenly we're off to the races with an international incident. CNN: Are we looking at a scenario where we're going to see a couple of missiles get launched or troops marching down to the (demilitarized zone)? Should people be legitimately scared about this? ... Walsh: Well, I think it is about trying to impress the family and the military. I don't think they're going to march a lot of people toward the DMZ. I think that would be provocative. Certainly, you could see other missile tests. That's a good question. They've done that in the past, short-range missiles. But I'm afraid what we're really looking at here, further down the road, is there's going to be the missile test, then there's going to be international reaction, and then (North Korea) is going to have to push back. So I would not rule out a nuclear test sometime later this year if this continues to ratchet up. CNN: This is obviously very provocative behavior by the North Koreans, even after there was just this highly publicized deal for food for this starving country. So what's the point? What are they trying to do? Walsh: That's the $100,000 question, and we really don't have an answer here. Now I know lot of people who have been following this over the years. They sort of think this is the same old, same old -- that we cut a deal and they've broken the deal; they got something, but they didn't live up to their promises. Well, that's not what's happening here. There was a deal, and we really hadn't given them anything yet. We haven't given them the food aid. So that tells me one (of) two things happened. Either there was some misunderstanding about the contents of that deal -- the Americans thought one thing, the North Koreans the other -- or maybe that deal got back to Pyongyang and then ran into trouble there. Maybe the military pushed back, or there was something else going on. But at this point, we don't know the reason. If we had an answer to that question, that would tell us what's going on inside North Korea. It's the most opaque society in the world -- more than Iran, more than any other place on Earth -- so we really don't know what's going on.\n### Response: ", "target": "North Korea appears moving ahead with plans to launch a long-range missile .\nAnalyst Jim Walsh discusses Pyongyang's possible motivations .\nWalsh sees some posturing going on, legitimacy building for North Korea's new leader .\nHe says he thinks situation could escalate into a nuclear test like it did in 2006 and 2009 .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?\n### Input:Smolensk, Russia (CNN) -- When I found the first piece of fuselage, I was shocked. It was flimsy, the thin metal easily twisted back on itself. Gray on one side, some yellow on the other, it sat in a small puddle of mud a few feet from the road. I was half a mile from the runway, the tall silver birch trees nearby broken like so many matchsticks. Somehow I thought planes were supposed to be stronger than this, but what I was confronted with was an object lesson on the precarious nature of flying. The evidence of what had happened was clear. The plane struck the trees, at first just grazing their uppermost branches and then their slender boughs and trunks. It was enough to rip the plane apart. What feels almost invincible as it powers through takeoff and thrusts upward through the skies at hundreds of miles an hour had been reduced to shreds of metal, little more than a discarded tin can. These are the thoughts that flashed through my mind in those first moments of discovery. And that's when the horror of it sinks in. The last tragic moments for all aboard; it's impossible to imagine the awfulness of those final seconds. I am swept by another emotion, sadness for the families, and I feel captured by an undefined grief. I knew no one aboard, but to see how their lives ended is to know a tiny fraction of the pain their loved ones must bear. But I have come to work, to tell the story of what happened, to piece together the small bits of information we'll get, to make some sense of our corner of this huge tragedy. So that is what my team and I do. Tommy Evans, my producer, and Luis Grahame-Yool, our cameraman, get to work and set up the first live shot. It's cold in Smolensk -- there are still piles of snow here and there. None of us have had much sleep. Luis arrived 12 hours ahead of us, Tommy and I flew in from Macedonia. All of us took the 400-kilometer drive from Moscow to get here. Each of us intent on our job, each of us grappling with the enormity of the day. No day is ever normal at CNN, but this defies even that logic. A president, his wife, many of the country's top military, political and religious leaders killed in a country that's not their own. The implications could be huge. As the day wore on and more details emerged, it seemed clear Russia wanted to make it known it was not at fault. Evidence pointed toward the pilots rather than a mechanical error. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who is leading Russia's investigation, was on course to lay blame at Poland's door. He has a reputation as a tough autocrat, and it seemed to me that's what we are seeing here. But we got to see another face of Putin, too: The stony-faced solemn friend of Poland. There seemed little doubting his grief and seriousness as he stood at the foot of the Polish president's casket during the long sombre repatriation ceremony we witnessed that afternoon. Having stood among the wreckage and broken trees as he has, it is not hard to imagine that this iron man of Russian politics was moved by what he saw. For who among us, however familiar with tragedy, could fail to be touched by the scale and nature of Poland's loss.\n### Response:", "target": "CNN's Nic Robertson writes from scene of air crash in Russia .\nDifficult to think of the horror of passengers' last moments .\nBroken trees suggest airplane hit them and disintegrated .\nRussia's Vladimir Putin is solemn at fallen leader's casket .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Winners: Arsenal beat Roma 7-6 on penalties after one of their fans was injured before the game. A spokesman from the British Embassy in Rome told CNN the fan was understood to have suffered wounds to the leg -- but it was unsure if he had been stabbed or injured by broken glass. The spokesman said the mini bus, which was not an official tour bus, became lost near the stadium and \"ended up at the wrong part of the ground\". Roma fans nearby set about attacking the bus, the spokesman said. \"They smashed the windows and then one of them managed to get on the bus. This appears to be where the injury occurred,\" he said. Police were quick to arrive and the bus managed to move on to safety, where the fan was treated for the wound, he said. The visiting side went on to win the tie 7-6 on penalties after Roma won the game 1-0, leaving the two-match tie level 1-1 on aggregate. Arsenal had distributed a booklet to its estimated 3,500 traveling fans warning that they were \"at risk\" if they traveled alone to the Stadio Olimpico. The booklet warned supporters to stay clear of areas that were known gathering points of Roma's \"Ultra\" fans -- a group known for creating conflict with rival supporters. Last month ten football fans were shot dead in the south of Nigeria on the way to support their team. The victims were traveling supporters of the Ocean Boys Football Club in Nigeria. Also in February, one fan was killed and at least 40 more injured when violence broke out at football matches across Brazil. In 2007, Manchester United fans were injured after violence in two separate incidents with Roma fans when the teams met in Rome.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?\n### Input:(CNN) -- If this weekend's box office battle was a big-screen boxing match, it would have been the original \"Rocky\": grinning, glamorous Apollo Creed against little-known and less-regarded Rocky Balboa. No one expected that one to go the full 15 rounds, either. In this weekend's showdown, it was the established \"Gone Girl\" against newcomer fantasy action flick \"Dracula Untold.\" \"Gone Girl\" held the title belt, but not by much: the adaptation of Gillian Flynn's best-seller earned roughly $26.8 million compared with \"Dracula Untold's\" $23.5 million. But \"Gone Girl\" seemed to have everything going for it, including big-name stars (led by Oscar winner Ben Affleck), critical acclaim and tremendous word of mouth. Estimated second-weekend ticket sales fell just 29%, compared with the 40% to 50% decline most box office champs suffer in their second week out. Unlike the champ, \"Untold\" seemed to have everything going against it. With the lead role held by Luke Evans, best known as the bad guy in last year's \"Fast & Furious 6,\" there was a lack of major stars. Then there was the consideration of competition: Horror movie \"Annabelle\" had opened the previous weekend, and unlike last year, most fright flicks are underperforming in 2014. And the reviews? Most critics put a stake through its heart, leaving \"Dracula Untold\" at a putrid 26% on RottenTomatoes.com. Yet when the dust settled, \"Dracula Untold\" was the weekend's top new movie. It's a fresh take on the Dracula legend: Evans plays Vlad as a heroic figure who's willing to do anything, including join the undead, to protect his family and his homeland. When you add in international ticket sales, the action-horror movie has already made back its $70 million budget. Newcomer \"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day\" also had much going for it, making its debut with big stars (Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner) and a story based on a much-loved book (Judith Viorst's 1972 children's classic). While the live-action comedy knocked rival family film \"The Boxtrolls\" well down the chart, it also found itself sitting on the sidelines in third place. The weekend's other new movies, \"The Judge,\" starring Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall, and \"Addicted,\" starring Sharon Leal and Boris Kodjoe, performed about as expected, debuting fifth and seventh, respectively. And after 2\u00c2\u00bd months, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" finally fell out of the top 10. That said, people are still going to see the top-grossing movie of the year: It's up to $326 million domestic. Turns out we are all Groot. Weekend domestic box office estimates from Exhibitor Relations Co., with final numbers available Monday afternoon: . 1. \"Gone Girl\": $26.8 million ($78.3 million total) 2. \"Dracula Untold\": $23.5 million (debut) 3. \"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day\": $19.1 million (debut) 4. \"Annabelle\": $16.4 million ($62.2 million total) 5. \"The Judge\": $13.3 million (debut)\n### Response: ", "target": "\"Dracula Untold\" was the weekend's top new movie .\nBut returning champ \"Gone Girl\" held the title belt .\nFamily comedy \"Alexander\" opened at No. 3 .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given text.\n### Input :(CNN) -- CNN created the Global Wage Calculator with data supplied by the International Labor Organization, which takes on the gargantuan task of compiling the average wage of the world, as well as individual countries. The ILO collects this data by sending out annual questionnaires to countries' national statistical authorities and also trying to collect it directly from national statistical authorities' publicly available information. They can't cover the entire world -- some countries don't supply or have the information -- but this interactive uses data which counts for 93% of the globe's employees. However, there are some important caveats. The total employed population is broken into two groups. Employees who earn a wage, and the self-employed who earn what the ILO calls \"employment-related income.\" The ILO does not include the latter because what is earned as a \"wage\" and what is earned as \"profit\" and reinvested in the company is hard to untangle and could therefore confuse the concepts. The share of employees in total employment varies across the world. In most developed economies, employees represent about 85% of total employment. However, in developing countries this is much less. In Africa, for example, employees are on average about 30% of total employment. This means the average wage as calculated by the ILO will not always capture what an average family lives on, particularly as self-employed workers in developing countries can earn much less than wage earners. China is also a special case. There is information on public wages and private wages, but nothing which combines the two. Because the percentage split is unclear, the ILO keeps the data points separate. The concept of an \"average wage\" is also imperfect because inequality has increased across the globe, and the percentage of low paid workers has increased in a substantial number of countries. However, global distribution figures still show how the majority of people in the world are still earning far less than the wealthy minority. The data also comes from different years, as some countries don't send their data to the ILO as regularly as others. However, with wages stagnant in recent years, at least in developed economies, the differences are likely to be small. You can see what year your data comes from in the blurb comparing your wage to the average in your country. In order to be able to compare wages globally, they are converted into what's called a \"purchasing power parity\" U.S. dollar.

The actor popped up at a birthday party in Charleston, South Carolina, over the weekend, getting down with the crowd to DJ Snake and Lil Jon's hit \"Turn Down for What.\" Murray is making as much of a name for dropping in on events as he has for some of his more more famous films like \"Lost in Translation\" and \"Caddyshack.\" His appearance this time doesn't quite count as crashing, as it seems the birthday boy invited him through the party's chef, who is a friend of Murray's. The mercurial Murray didn't have to travel far -- he owns a home in Charleston -- for the latest stop on his ongoing comical mystery tour. For those keeping score, the funnyman has turned up at a Charleston bachelor party where he offered the groom some relationship advice, a Manhattan karaoke bar, a student house party in Scotland, a kickball game on New York's Roosevelt Island and an event at SXSW where he bartended, just to name a few. There's even a website dedicated to collecting Bill Murray stories, both the real and the fictitious (which, it turns out, sound a great deal alike). The Toronto Film Festival declared September 5 to be Bill Murray Day in part to ensure that he'd show up to promote his latest movie, \"St. Vincent.\" Despite being an acclaimed actor, Murray has no agent or official representation and is not on social media. So good luck getting him as the cool factor at your next kegger unless you can do what execs have to when casting him in a Hollywood film: pick up the phone and give him a call.

The ship, the MV Rim, changed course and is heading for the Somali Basin, the EU Naval Force said. Two U.S. Navy ships working with NATO confirmed the hijacking, the USS Porter and a helicopter from the USS Farragut, the task force added. The 4,800-ton ship is owned by Libya's White Sea Shipping. It is not clear how many crew members are on board or where they come from. The attack comes two days after pirates released a Greek-owned vessel and its crew months after hijacking it off Somalia. The MV Filitsa was released Monday after its owner paid a ransom, said Michael Battzoglou, a security officer and spokesman for the owner, Order Shipping Co. He did not say how much had been paid. \"All are well and safe,\" Battzoglou added. The Greek coast guard also said no one had been killed or injured on the vessel. The EU Naval Force confirmed the ransom had been paid and the ship freed. It did not say how much money changed hands. The bulk carrier was hijacked November 11 off Somalia near the Seychelles, and was held at the pirate stronghold of Hobyo on the Somali coast, the EU said. The coast off lawless Somalia has become a hub for piracy. At least three ships have been attacked in the region this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau, a nonprofit group that tracks and fights maritime crime and malpractice. Pirates in the area hold nine ships with a total of 216 crew members, not including the MV Rim, said the bureau's Capt. Cyrus Mody. The pirates normally seek payment to release ships. The EU mission's main tasks include escorting merchant vessels carrying humanitarian aid for the World Food Program, protecting vulnerable ships in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean, and deterring and disrupting piracy.\n### Response : ", "target": "North Korean-flagged cargo ship seized in Gulf of Aden .\nAttack comes two days after pirates released a Greek-owned vessel .\nCoast off Somalia has become a hub for piracy .\nGreek ship's owner said it paid ransom for crew's release .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The company said it was the first theft in the company's 20-year history. Police in Nice, France, confirmed the heist but said the necklace was only worth 1 million euros ($1.3 million U.S.). Police in Cap d'Antibes, the posh resort town where the party was held, gave a third figure -- $1 million (773,000 euros). The de Grisogono statement said it had hired more than 80 security guards for the event at the Cap Eden Roc hotel in Cap d'Antibes, just east of Cannes. On Friday, police in Nice said that more than $1 million in jewels belonging to the Swiss firm Chopard had been stolen from a hotel room in Cannes. Chopard later said in a statement that the value of the stolen pieces was \"far lower than those in the figures circulating in the media.\" The theft of the jewels occurred May 16, on the second day of the festival, which runs through May 26. Commandant Bernard Mascarelli of the Nice police said the jewelry was stolen from a room in the Suite Novotel hotel on Boulevard Carnot in Cannes. A Chopard employee who was staying in the room left it for several hours to go to dinner, he said. She returned to discover the whole safe containing the jewels had been unscrewed and taken away. No detailed description of the stolen jewels has been given, but a Chopard spokeswoman said they were not part of the firm's \"Red Carpet Collection 2013\" and were not due to be worn by any actresses in Cannes.

The France international was handed a three-match ban by European football's governing body UEFA for his sending-off in the first leg of the semifinal against Lyon last month. He was initially given an automatic one-game suspension for the straight red card, which came for a challenge on the French club's Argentine forward Lisandro Lopez in Munich on April 21. That was extended by another two games by UEFA's control and disciplinary panel on April 28, meaning the 27-year-old had to miss the final as well as the second leg, plus the first Champions League match of next season. Ribery's German employers announced after Wednesday's announcement in Nyon, Switzerland, that they would take the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the UK Press Association reported. PA said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge had told reporters outside UEFA headquarters that the club would go to CAS in order to have Ribery available for the final in Madrid on May 22. \"Franck Ribery, as well as our in-house counsel Dr Gerlinger, have in my view put an impressive case to the court that we are not dealing with violent conduct but merely a foul,\" Rummenigge said in a statement. \"The committee rated this case as a borderline case.

{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.(CNN) -- With sympathy, grief and some outrage, Chinese netizens expressed their condolences over the deaths of two Chinese schoolgirls in Saturday's crash landing of an Asiana Airlines flight at San Francisco International Airport. Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, both 16, are the sole casualties of the ill-fated flight carrying 307 passengers and crew. They were part of a group of 35 teachers and students from a middle school in the eastern Chinese city of Jiangshan traveling to California for a summer camp program. The crash remained one of the top trending topics on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo on Monday, garnering over 1.7 million posts with the hashtag \"Boeing 777 crash.\" It was also the leading topic on Tencent Weibo, with over 240,000 posts. \"May you rest in peace in Heaven. God will forever be with you,\" wrote user HaiDianYuAiLiSi, one of thousands of netizens who took to weibo platforms to express sadness over the loss of two promising young lives. Many attached photos of lit candles or appended their posts with candle icons in a symbolic vigil to honor the two girls. \"These kids were so young. Their families are so pitiful,\" wrote user JinShuRenDouFuNao, echoing broad sympathy for the victims' parents. Some netizens also hit out at China's one-child policy for leaving the parents bereft of surviving children. \"Now that the child is gone, her parents' last hope is also gone. It's really heartbreaking. If they had two or three children, it would at least be a bit better for her parents,\" wrote user BianBaXianK. An official apology posted by Asiana on Sina Weibo sparked a debate over the qualifications of the pilot, with rumors rapidly spreading among Sina Weibo users that the plane was flown by an \"intern.\" \"Can an apology be exchanged for two lives? Asking interns to operate long-distance flights shows a complete disregard for human life. Even though tickets are cheap, you cannot treat people's lives like a joke,\" wrote user Kazumi Wawa. Asiana has announced that while the pilot was making his first landing with a Boeing 777 at San Francisco International Airport, it was not his first time flying to San Francisco. He has clocked 43 hours flying a Boeing 777 and piloted a total of about 10,000 hours, the airline said. As is often the case with social media, a handful of netizens displayed cavalier indifference to the victims, branding the girls overprivileged to be able to afford summer camp in the United States.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you briefly describe the text?\n### Input:(CNN) -- As the terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) continues to capture and control more territory in Iraq and Syria, it is important to realize what is at stake in the region and for the American people. The challenge that ISIS poses is not just to Iraq's stability but also to U.S. security. ISIS is a terrorist group with their own army and bank account that has a clear and growing ability to conduct terrorist attacks against the Iraqi government, Americans and U.S. interests, and even the U.S. homeland. ISIS, although loosely affiliated with al Qaeda, is in many respects even more extreme in its methods and its brutality than the terrorists who plotted and carried out 9/11. Although until now ISIS has focused its military goals on Syria and Iraq, its ranks include thousands of jihadists who have streamed into Syria and now into Iraq from around the globe as well as known terrorists who have been released or freed from Iraqi prisons. ISIS's goal is to secure its hold over large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, to establish an Islamic state or \"caliphate\" that stretches across the heart of the Middle East. As we have learned in the past, terrorists seek safe havens from which to operate, often in failed or failing states. They use this territory to train and equip themselves, raise funds and plot attacks. In addition to the threat to the U.S. homeland, we also need to be concerned that if Iraq begins to fragment, the resulting chaos and instability will ripple throughout the region. ISIS has sown incredible instability in Syria and is now seeking to do the same in Iraq. If we allow ISIS to spread further, their next targets will be U.S. allies and partners already under sufficient strain from the ongoing conflict in Syria, such as Jordan and even Saudi Arabia. We have an imperfect partner in Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who has shown himself unable to govern inclusively. We need to make clear to Baghdad that significant U.S. assistance will not be possible unless a national unity government is formed that does not include al-Maliki. Iran has already entered the fight on behalf of the al-Maliki government in Baghdad. But if we delegate this problem to Iran, we are likely to see the creation of a Shiite rump state that would effectively become an Iranian proxy and extend Iran's reach and influence from the Gulf of Oman to the Mediterranean Sea. So, what should we do? First and foremost, we need to move now to degrade ISIS's capabilities. The President's decision to send 300 advisers to Iraq is a good first step, but their ability to deter ISIS will be limited unless we eventually engage in airstrikes to target their leaders as well as the supply lines that they use to transfer weapons and fighters between Syria and Iraq. We know where these supply lines are, we should not hesitate to halt the ISIS resupply to their strongholds in Anbar, Ninawa and Salah ad-Din. Second, we also need to understand that our lack of an effective Syria strategy has allowed ISIS to take hold and flourish in the region. ISIS has been able to develop its capabilities, increase its ranks, and obtain combat experience for its fighters over the last 18 months in northern Syria. We need to begin to tackle the root causes of the problem in Syria by overtly arming the moderate Syrian rebels that are fighting ISIS in that country even as we simultaneously tackle the challenge they currently pose to Iraq. The U.S. and allies should consider additional counter terrorism measures in Syria, perhaps working with regional partners. This is all a response to the same problem, and must be part of a unified strategy. The President's long overdue announcement on Thursday of an overt plan to train and equip moderates in the opposition is a welcome development, but we need to do much more to finally deal with the threat that the Syrian conflict poses to regional stability and ultimately, to U.S. security. Third, as ISIS has gained ground in Iraq, its wealth and ability to make money have increased. We need to stop their ability to sell the Syrian and Iraqi oil they attempt to market to the outside world. We also need a new diplomatic strategy to counter ISIS funding and support. Unfortunately, some of our partners in the Gulf have contributed to this problem. Others in the region have turned a blind eye to foreign fighters flocking to the fight. This needs to end. Finally, our partners in the region need our support. Jordan deserves special attention and assistance. Jordan is already dealing with an influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees from the conflict in Syria. Jordan is a close partner of the United States and a likely target of ISIS's attention. In recent days, the group captured the border crossing between Iraq and Jordan. The United States should find ways to make clear that the United States will defend Jordan's security, including militarily if necessary. Some will argue that the challenges faced by Iraq or countries such as Jordan are none of our business. That we have spent too many years, lives, and dollars trying to make Iraq and the broader Middle East a better place. None of the options before us are ideal, but the question is whether we take action against ISIS now or deal with the consequences later here on U.S. soil. The stakes are too high for us to continue to ignore this problem. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.\n### Response : ", "target": "Sen.

Former U.S. soldier Steven Green got life in prison after being convicted of murdering four Iraqis. Steven Green, who escaped the death penalty this month, told relatives of the victims that he is \"truly sorry for what I did in Iraq.\" \"I helped to destroy a family and end the lives of four of my fellow human beings, and I wish that I could take it back, but I cannot,\" Green said, reading a statement at a victim impact hearing. \"And, as inadequate as this apology is, it is all I can give you.\" The family refused to accept the apology. Green was found guilty in U.S. District Court in Kentucky of raping a 14-year-old girl and murdering her, her parents and her 6-year-old sister in the town of Yusufiya, about 20 miles south of Baghdad, in 2006. A jury could not reach a unanimous decision on the death penalty, which means the judge is required under law to impose a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Green will be sentenced September 4, but the victim impact hearing was held Thursday so surviving members of the al-Janabi family could testify before they return to Iraq. They decried Green's sentence and testified about how the heinous crime had shattered their lives and how it will haunt them always. Green said that he knows \"you wish I was dead, and I do not hold that against you. If I was in your place, I am convinced beyond any doubt that I would feel the same way.\" He added, \"I know that I have done evil, and I fear that the wrath of the Lord will come upon me on that day. But, I hope that you and your family at least can find some comfort in God's justice.\" The wailing family matriarch, Hajia al-Janabi, lunged at Green as she left the witness stand, denouncing him as a coward, a criminal and a stigma on the United States, according to Louisville's Courier-Journal newspaper. Security officers restrained the distressed woman, the newspaper said. Another family member, Mahdi al-Janabi, said Green had lost the ability to distinguish between terrorists and Iraqi civilians. Green was tried in a civilian court in Paducah, Kentucky, because he had been discharged from the Army by the time his crimes surfaced. He was the last of five soldiers who served in the 101st Airborne Division, based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to be convicted for the crimes and their subsequent cover-up. The others -- Spec. James Barker, Sgt. Paul Cortez, Pfc. Jesse Spielman and Pfc. Bryan Howard -- received sentences ranging from 27 months to 110 years, with the possibility of parole in 10 years in the most severe cases. Green said he now sees the Iraq war as \"intrinsically evil, because killing is intrinsically evil.\" He was sorry, he said, that he ever had anything to do with either.\n### Response :", "target": "\"I wish that I could take it back,\" says man convicted in 2006 attack .\nSteven Green must serve life in prison without parole .\nSurviving family members testify against Green at hearing .\nMatriarch lunges at Green while leaving witness stand .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The fires have been raging in five regions as Russia endures dry weather and one of the hottest months on record. Thursday saw Moscow reach 102 Fahrenheit (39 Celsius), the highest temperature since records began in 1879. The fires are the worst ever to hit the European part of Russia, the region west of the Ural Mountains, the RIA-Novosti news agency said. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said there have been 21,690 fires so far this summer, 10 percent more than last year, the news agency reported. President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the Defense Ministry on Friday to use the military to help tackle the fires, the president's spokeswoman, Natalya Timakova, told the Interfax news agency. The government has already dispatched additional firefighting units, along with 16 aircraft and helicopters, to fight the fires, RIA-Novosti said. Putin and Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu flew Friday to one of the affected regions, Nizhny Novgorod, where Putin called on local officials to step down. \"I recommend the resignation of the heads of regions (devastated by fire) who have, to a significant degree, lost the trust of citizens,\" Putin said, according to RIA-Novosti. Many residents who lost their homes in Nizhny Novgorod had complained to Putin that local authorities' actions were \"chaotic and uncoordinated,\" RIA-Novosti reported. The fires have so far killed 25 people, including two firefighters, according to an official at the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry. Across the 14 fire-striken regions of central Russia, 1,257 homes have burned, and some 2,000 people have been left without housing. Sixty homes were burned in the region of Moscow. \"I don't know what to do,\" one Voronezh woman told state TV. \"Haven't got any bed linen, cups, spoons, forks left. We're left with nothing. Everything was burned down. We couldn't salvage anything.\" Putin said the families of those who died will receive 1 million rubles ($33,000) each in compensation, and the government will pay around 3 million rubles ($100,000) for the reconstruction of each destroyed house, RIA-Novosti said. Putin also said the government will compensate people for the loss of property, the news agency said. Temperatures across much of western and central Russia have topped 95 Fahrenheit (35 Celsius) during the past five weeks, RIA-Novosti said. Thursday's temperature in Moscow broke the previous record high of 99.5 Fahrenheit (37.5 Celsius), set just three days earlier. The month of July is expected to break the record for the hottest month ever recorded in Moscow. High temperatures in Moscow dropped to between 82 and 86 Fahrenheit (28 to 30 Celsius) Friday because of a breeze, but weekend temperatures were forecast to rise again. The threat of more fires breaking out will remain high in the Central and Volga Federal Districts next week, given the abnormal heart wave and the lack of rain, the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia has reported on its web site. The hot, dry weather is believed to have dried out large parts of land, making it easier for flames to spread. Central Russia also has large areas of peat bogs that often catch on fire in dry and hot weather. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.\n### Response :", "target": "NEW: Two firefighters are among the dead .\nNEW: 1,257 houses have burned, while some 2,000 people are left without a home .\nPutin calls on local officials to resign because of their fire response .\nThe fires are reportedly the worst ever to hit western Russia .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?(CNN) -- It's not your imagination: Our politics are more polarized than at any point in recent history. That's the conclusion of a new survey from the indispensable Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. And if you needed more evidence of the passionate and sometimes poisonous polarization afflicting our nation, you didn't have to look further than the crowds in Wisconsin on Tuesday night after the recall attempt. Here's the real wake-up call: Americans are more divided about partisan politics right now than they are about race, class, gender and age. That's right: Forget the original sin of slavery and the longstanding fights over civil rights -- those old divisions now seem small compared with perceptions of whether a person is a Republican or Democrat. Welcome to the new bigotry, where a person's partisan identification is a source of prejudice, seen as a reflection of fundamentally different values, representative of an alien America. Like any form of prejudice, this is learned behavior, exacerbated by the daily drumbeat of partisan media. Conservatives are led to believe that liberals are essentially less patriotic and secretly socialist, while some liberals believe that conservatives are bigoted Bible thumpers. The mutual distrust leads members of different parties to feel unfairly judged by the other side, further fueling polarization -- and so fellow Americans divide into warring camps, us against them. Partisan difference didn't always seem like an unbridgeable divide. But over the past 25 years, the split on basic values between Republicans and Democrats has skyrocketed. For example, on the issue of the environment, at the end of the Reagan era, 86% of Republicans and 93% of Democrats believed that \"there needs to be stricter laws and regulations to protect the environment.\" That broad consensus has fallen apart -- now, 47% of Republicans support that statement, while Democrats' sentiment remains the same. Likewise, take a look at attitudes regarding the social safety net -- a quarter century ago 62% of Republicans and 79% of Democrats believed that government should \"take care of people that could not take care of themselves.\" Today, 40% of Republicans believe in that aspect of the social contract, while 75% of Democrats still do. What happened to compassionate conservatism? These policy divides reflect increased ideological and demographic differences between the two parties. Over two-thirds of Republicans self-identify as conservative and 87% are non-Hispanic white, with an average age of 50. Democrats are evenly split between liberals and centrists, more racially diverse than ever before and less likely to be religious or have \"old-fashioned values about family and marriage.\" There is however a hopeful sign beneath the hyper-partisanship -- a healthy rebellion against this division and consequent dysfunction in Washington. According to the Pew survey, a record number of Americans are declaring their independence and proactively rejecting both the Republican and Democratic parties. In fact, there are more independents than Democrats or Republicans. It is a direct reaction against the unprecedented polarization of the two parties. And this ain't no mushy middle. As in surveys past, we can see that independent voters tend to be closer on economic issues to Republicans and closer to Democrats on social issues. Most importantly, while the two parties are deeply polarized, independent voters' attitudes on issues most closely parallel the American people as a whole. At heart, most Americans are nonideological problem-solvers, and that's a quality we see less and less of in our politicians. Why does this growing polarization matter? First, because it is resulting in an inability of the two parties to reason together on pressing issues such as improving the economy or dealing with the deficit and the debt. But more broadly, it risks undermining a core bit of American wisdom expressed in our national motto -- e pluribus unum: out of many, one. Democracy requires competing political parties, but they are not supposed to take the place of tribal affiliations. That they are is evidence of group-think that pushes the idea that people who think differently about politics or policy are not merely mistaken but a clear and present danger to the Constitution. That's the way political opponents become enemies -- even (and especially) if we don't know them personally. Changing the culture of hyper-partisanship will take time. It requires pushing back at the constant drumbeat of partisan media that polarizes in the pursuit of profit. It requires showing that there is a strong alternative, a better way to conduct civic debates. But this effort is essential to restoring common sense and collegiality to our politics. We can take comfort from the wise words of the original founding father, George Washington, who devoted a considerable portion of his farewell address to warning against the dangers and distortions of hyper-partisanship: \"One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts,\" he wrote. \"You cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.\n### Response:", "target": "John Avlon: Pew study confirms politics divides Americans more than race, class, age, gender .\nHe says it's bigotry, a learned behavior profoundly alienating Americans from each other .\nHe says GOP support of social safety net, environment way down, Democrats about same .\nAvlon: Split undermines core belief of e pluribus unum .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you briefly describe the text?Bacliff, Texas (CNN) -- Sitting on their front porch in this Houston suburb, Edmond Demiraj and his family seem the picture of a contented family. But the Department of Justice now wants to upend the family: threatening to deport his wife and 19-year-old son back to their native Albania, even though he says federal prosecutors a decade ago promised him help and a Green Card in exchange for Edmond's promised testimony in a human smuggling case against a fellow Albanian immigrant. For the Demiraj family, they believe it will mean great harm, even death, for those deported. A decade ago, Edmond Demiraj (pronounced: dem-EAR-eye) was himself an illegal immigrant. He told CNN he had walked across the U.S. border from Mexico to Brownsville, Texas without any paperwork. He found work as a painter, he says, with a fellow Albanian named Bill Bedini. Not long afterwards, the Justice Department indicted Bedini, accusing him and others of running a human smuggling ring, bringing illegal aliens from Mexico into the United States. Demiraj was named in the original indictment but charges against him were later dropped. Attorneys for the Justice Department based in Houston wanted Demiraj to testify against Bedini. In exchange, Demiraj told CNN that prosecutors promised him and his family protection and promised him a Green Card, which would lead to citizenship. The offer, he says, was verbal and not on paper. \"I'm ready to work for the U.S. government, whatever they need from me,\" Demiraj told CNN. But Bedini entered a plea of not guilty, was granted bail and soon fled to Albania, according to the U.S. Marshal's office in Houston. Federal prosecutors didn't need Demiraj's testimony and handed him over to immigration officials, who quickly deported him as well. Within a few weeks back in his native Albania, Demiraj says, Bedini attacked him and tried to kill him. \"I was on my knees and he pointed the gun straight at me,\" Demiraj told CNN. \"He shot me.\" Demiraj says it was only luck that saved him. Neighbors, he said, heard the gunshot and came to his assistance. Bedini fled, leaving Demiraj with a bullet wound in his side and stomach. Demiraj also says Bedini forced three nieces into prostitution in Italy but they were eventually rescued. Demiraj returned once again to the United States, again he says entering illegally at Brownsville. This time, immigration agents apprehended him and he says he spent seven months in an immigration jail before being allowed to remain in the United States on temporary status. That was six years ago. Almost ever since his return to the United States, he says, federal prosecutors have tried to deport his wife, Rodina and son, Rediol, back to Albania. His two other smaller children were born in Texas and are legal residents. \"What do you think will happen to your wife and son if they back to Albania,?\" Demiraj was asked. \"Oh, they're going to be killed. They are going to be killed,\" he replied. One federal prosecutor agreed, saying in an appellate court argument that \"there is a possibility that Mrs. Demiraj will be persecuted\" if she returns to Albania. Still, she added, \"She (Mrs. Demiraj) hasn't met her legal burden when it comes to asylum.\" Even despite the dangers for Rodina Demiraj, the Justice Department is pursuing deportation. The original assistant U.S. attorney who offered Edmond Demiraj a Green Card and, according to him, protection will not comment to CNN. She is Marina Garcia Marmojelo, now nominated by President Barack Obama to be a federal judge. The only official comment to CNN from Justice is this: \"The department is not aware of any promises of physical protection ever made to Mr. Demiraj or his family. Notwithstanding this fact, we have been (in) active discussions with counsel for the Demiraj family for some time.\" Demiraj's lawyers are outraged. \"This is just a shameful display of how the U.S. government will use people who they need to keep us safe and then cavalierly discard them when they are no longer of use to them,\" said Josh Rosenkranz, a New York City attorney whose firm is now representing the family. Edmond Demiraj says he will never let his wife and son return to Albania. \"I don't know what I am going to do,\" he told CNN. \"But I am not going to let them go.\" Watch Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 weeknights 10pm ET.

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary that explains everything about this article for meCan you provide a brief rundown of the text?\n### Input:HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's opposition leader called the cholera outbreak in his country a \"man-made crisis,\" as new figures released Thursday showed the death toll had soared to more than 2,700. Morgan Tsvangirai tours a cholera ward at Budiriro Polyclinic in Harare Thursday. Some 2,755 have died and 48,623 people are suspected to have been infected with cholera since last year, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. Opposition party leader Morgan Tsvangirai, speaking to reporters, pointed a finger at the Mugabe government. \"Cholera in Zimbabwe is a man-made crisis. The problem we have here is coupled with (the) fact of negligence on the part of government to provide the necessary facilities. It shows the collapse of the health delivery system,\" said Tsvangirai. The Movement for Democratic Change leader's comments came after he toured some of the worst affected areas in the country's capital, Harare. Zimbabwe's cholera epidemic, which started in August, has been aggravated by erratic water supplies, shortages of water purification chemicals, broken water and sewer pipes and uncollected garbage. Cholera is an intestinal disease cause by bacteria in contaminated water. The epidemic was followed a month later by a strike by doctors and nurses demanding a review of their salaries. They are demanding that archaic hospital equipment be replaced and that medicines be available in hospitals. The health emergency comes at a time when Zimbabwe is mired in the worst economic crisis it has faced since it gained independence from Great Britain in 1980. Last week, the United Nations' Children's Fund (UNICEF) gave $5 million to Zimbabwe's ailing health sector to help end the industrial action by health personnel. As Tsvangirai was visiting the cholera affected areas, some residents could be seen getting water from the wells and rivers. Most suburbs in Harare have had no water for close to two weeks, forcing residents to depend on shallow pits and rivers for drinking water. The Zimbabwe National Water Authority was quoted by the state-owned media Saturday attributing the dryness to a water pump which had broken-down. The areas particularly affected include the townships of Glen Norah, Glen View and Budiriro. \"I am here with my kids for the last two days,\" said Ennie Musararei, a mother of three at Budiriro clinic. \"It (cholera) just started after we drank water from a well. We thought it was safe to drink since it was covered by a metal sheet.\" President Robert Mugabe's government have now declared cholera a national emergency, so that international organizations such as UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders and Red Cross can gain access. But death toll has continued to increase daily. \"This week alone has witnessed a sudden increase of patients,\" said a nurse at Budiriro clinic. \"I think it is mainly because of the rains and dryness of the suburbs over the past week or so.\" Earlier this month, Zimbabwe's health minister, David Parirenyatwa, said the death toll was likely to increase as the country is in its rainy season. The meteorological office in Zimbabwe has predicted floods in some parts of the country.\n### Response :", "target": "World Health Organization: 2,755 cholera deaths in Zimbabwe since last year .\nTsvangirai: Govt. negligence resulted in failure to provide necessary facilities .\nEpidemic aggravated by erratic water supplies, broken water and sewer pipes .\nMugabe's government have now declared cholera a national emergency .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you briefly describe the text?\n### Input: Three students at the University of California Santa Barbara were being treated Thursday for meningococcal disease, a bacterial infection that causes bloodstream infections and meningitis, health officials said. The students -- two males and a female -- became ill between November 11 and November 18, according to the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department. Two cases are confirmed to be the same strain, said department spokeswoman Susan Klein-Rothschild. The three were in contact \"directly or secondarily,\" she said. All the cases were caused by meningococcal bacteria known as type B, the same strain found in seven cases of meningitis, an infection of the lining of the brain, at Princeton University since March. However, no link has been found between the California cases and those at Princeton, the health department said. \"This is not expected, as cases of meningococcal disease can occur sporadically in college settings since this population has an increased risk,\" the department said in a statement. Generally, college-aged youth, particularly those in their first year who live in residence halls, are at increased risk of meningococcal disease. Kissing, sharing eating utensils or food, and drinks or cigarettes can increase risk. Public health officials and the university are looking into the cases. Some 300 students who have had close contact with the ill students were being given antibiotics, the statement said. Princeton is preparing to provide a vaccine, unlicensed in the United States, which targets meningitis B, pending final approval from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Santa Barbara County, UCSB, California Department of Public Health and Centers for Disease Control have already had preliminary discussions about the vaccine,\" the statement said. \"Santa Barbara County and UCSB will be monitoring the situation closely and continuing to explore the possibility of vaccination.\" There are two forms of meningitis: bacterial and viral.

{"source": "### Instruction: What are the highlights?\n### Input:(CNN) -- Deadly fighting between Yemeni government forces and al Qaeda erupted in a restive southern province on Saturday. Demonstrators took to the streets and demanded the creation of an interim body that would guide and shape the country's political transition. Twenty-one al Qaeda members and 10 Yemeni soldiers have been killed in Yemen's Abyan province, where fighting has raged Saturday, Yemen's state-run news agency reported. Clashes between security forces and suspected militants have erupted in Lawdar and Zinjibar, towns in Abyan -- a militant stronghold with a presence of Yemen's al Qaeda wing, SABA reported, citing a military official. Eighteen al Qaeda members and nine soldiers were killed in Zinjibar and three militants and one soldier were killed in Lowdar, the report said. Dozens of people were injured. \"The heroes of the armed and security forces in Abyan province caused the terrorist elements of al Qaeda heavy losses in lives and material after fierce confrontations with those elements that began in the early hours of the morning and lasted several hours and ended with the killing of a number of them and injuring many others,\" SABA reported. A Yemeni security official, who has asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN that Yemen's government conducted air raids on positions in Lawdar believed to be held by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Government forces have been fighting Islamic militants who seized the town of Zinjibar. Heavy gunfire and explosions were heard through the city, and planes were seen flying overhead and conducting airstrikes, witnesses and residents said. The military official cited by SABA said Yemeni military forces targeted a warehouse used by militants to store weapons and cars used by the fighters. The official said troops are working to track down al Qaeda fighters and \"cleanse the pockets and hiding places where terrorists are present.\" Yemen has been consumed with unrest for months as protesters demand an end to the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. In recent weeks, government troops have battled both anti-government tribal forces and Islamic militants, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. A six-nation Gulf Arab alliance, the Gulf Cooperation Council, has tried to broker a government-opposition agreement that would lead to Saleh's departure, but that effort has so far been unsuccessful. The demonstrations continued on Saturday as thousands of anti-government protesters took to the streets in Sanaa, Taiz, Ibb and Hodeidah, eyewitnesses said. Witnesses said the demonstrators on Saturday called for the vice president to create an interim transitional council to help fashion a political transition. They accused the United States and the GCC of supporting the Saleh regime, and demanded support of the youth revolution. Anti-government forces also criticized opposition political parties and politicians for supporting the GCC deal, which would lead to Saleh's departure but give him immunity. Khaled Al-Anesi, a prominent rights activist in Sanaa, said the United States and the international community should support the Yemen revolution \"as it did in Tunisia and Egypt if it wants Yemen to continue to be its ally in the future.\" The chaos there intensified when Saleh and other senior officials were injured in a June 3 attack on the mosque at the presidential palace. Saleh and other senior officials injured in the attack went to Saudi Arabia for treatment. A government spokesman said Thursday Saleh was in good health and would be returning to Yemen \"within days.\" CNN's Saad Abedine contributed to this report.\n### Response: ", "target": "NEW: Protesters are calling for the creation of an interim transitional council .\n21 al Qaeda members and 10 soldiers have been killed, state TV says .\nFighting raged in two in Abyan province towns .\nA source says Yemen's government is conducting air raids .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The agency said Short \"committed a criminal act by secretly spreading his Bible tracts around a Buddhist temple in Pyongyang,\" after entering the country as a tourist. Short's wife, Karen, said she had been told by an Australian Embassy official that her husband had arrived in Beijing. The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it had received confirmation that Short had been released and was being deported. \"Clearly, this is welcome news for Mr. Short, his family and his supporters,\" the department said. KCNA published a written apology that it attributed to Short. \"I now realize the seriousness of my insult to the Korean people on February 16th because I made the Korean people angry and for this I truly apologize. \"I realize that my actions are an indelible hostile act against the independent right and law of the DPRK. \"I request the forgiveness of the DPRK for my actions,\" Short reportedly wrote. KCNA also accused him of \"spreading his Bible tracts in the Pyongyang Metro on a crowded train, causing a chaos in the sound public order of the DPRK,\" in August 2012. North Korea is known to push high-profile detainees to make false confessions. Merrill Newman, an American veteran of the Korean War detained by North Korea last year, said that he was made to deliver an \"apology\" on state media that was not his own words. Short's wife said last month that he had Gospel tracts in Korean with him in Pyongyang and that that issue seemed \"to be at the core of the detention.\" Short, a citizen of Australia, lives in Hong Kong. North and South Korea hold first family reunion in three years . His wife said Monday she didn't yet know when he would arrive back in the city, a special administrative region of China. \"Australian consular officials stand ready to provide assistance to Mr. Short to ensure he can return to his home in Hong Kong as soon as possible,\" the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. Short has been arrested multiple times while doing evangelical work in China \"for speaking out about brutality against Chinese Christians,\" according to a biography on a religious website named Gospel Attract. In the 1990s, he became \"persona non grata\" with Chinese authorities for almost two years and was unable to visit mainland China, the biography said. Last year, North Korea sentenced Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American, to 15 years of hard labor on charges he planned to topple the government through religious activities. Washington has repeatedly called on Pyongyang to release Bae, expressing concerns about his health. But Kim Jong Un's regime has so far refused to budge. Bae, 45, was widely reported to have been conducting missionary work in North Korea. His family says he ran a company specializing in tours of the secretive country. North Korea has a number of state-controlled churches, but the authoritarian Communist regime doesn't tolerate independent religious activities. The regime \"considers the spread of Christianity a particularly serious threat, since it challenges ideologically the official personality cult and provides a platform for social and political organization and interaction outside the realm of the state,\" a United Nations panel said in a report released last month. \"People caught practicing Christianity are subject to severe punishments in violation of the right to freedom of religion and the prohibition of religious discrimination,\" the report by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea said.

The meeting, scheduled for 10:30 a.m. (4:30 a.m. ET), is at Henry's request, Sarkozy's office said. France was eliminated from the World Cup on Tuesday after a 2-1 loss to tournament host South Africa. French media slams 'shameful' exit . It followed an apparent collapse in relations between coach Raymond Domenech and his players that saw captain Patrice Evra left out of the match and the team refusing to practice on Sunday. Henry, once France's main striker and a World Cup winner in 1998, was reduced to a minor role in this year's tournament as he started all three matches on the substitutes' bench. Pedro Pinto: Heads should roll for French farce . France, traditionally among the strongest national sides in world football and the losing finalist in Germany four years ago, become one of the first to be eliminated this time around. Striker Nicolas Anelka was sent home after confronting Domenech at halftime during France's 2-0 defeat by Mexico last week. Evra was then involved in a public training ground dispute with the squad's fitness coach on Sunday and is reported to have led dissent over Anelka's expulsion from the squad, with the entire squad boycotting the training session. Adding to the confusion, French team director Jean-Louis Valentin then publicly announced his resignation to the media, while French sports minister Roselyne Bachelot has been in France attempting to mediate between Domenech and his players. France's World Cup nightmare ends in defeat . But on Monday night Bachelot told journalists the French players had \"tarnished the image of France,\" according to French sports newspaper L'Equipe. In an indication of the extent to which relations had broken down between Domenech and his squad, the coach on Monday described this players' decision to strike as \"unspeakably stupid,\" and called their actions \"an aberration and an imbecility.\" \"Nobody can behave in such a way in the dressing room or elsewhere and high-level sportsmen and women have to lead by example through football,\" Domenech told reporters. \"We tried to convince the players that what was happening was irregular, that their actions were unspeakably stupid. I told myself this masquerade had to be stopped. No way would I back this action.\" France's problems at the World Cup had exacerbated long-standing dissatisfaction with the controversial Domenech, who is due to step down as national coach after the tournament to make way for former World Cup-winning defender Laurent Blanc. The French only qualified for South Africa by virtue of a tight playoff win over Ireland, sealed with the help of Henry's controversial handballed assist for William Gallas' goal.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?\n### Input:LONDON, England (CNN) -- You're sitting in an airport lounge and seize the chance to check your e-mails before your flight departs. You log on and are tempted by a wireless Internet provider offering free Internet access. So, do you take it? Wi-Fi users have been warned to protect their computers against potential hackers at Wi-Fi hotspots. Security experts warn that hackers may be masquerading as free public Wi-Fi providers to gain access to the laptops of unsuspecting travelers. All it takes, they say, is a computer program downloaded from the Internet, an open access point and a user who has ignored basic security advice. \"The difficulty for travelers is differentiating between a good Internet access hotspot and a rogue, or somebody trying to actually glean credentials from you. The issue is that you don't necessarily know the difference between a good and a bad one,\" computer security expert Sean Remnant told CNN. In 2008, AirTight Networks dispatched a number of so-called \"white hat\" hackers to 27 airports around the world to test the vulnerability of their Wi-Fi systems. They found that 80 percent of the private Wi-Fi networks tested were open or poorly protected. The wireless security company also found that basic services at several airports, including baggage handling systems, were vulnerable to hackers. Operators were using Wired Equivalent Privacy, known as WEP, which was found to provide inadequate protection to hackers as early as 2001. One year after the survey was conducted, CNN Business Traveler met Remnant at London's Heathrow airport, which was not included in the original survey, to test the potential dangers to unprotected Wi-Fi users.  Watch what happened when we took a hacker to Heathrow \u00bb . Armed with a laptop, our \"white hat\" hacker took a seat in the crowded departure lounge at Terminal 3 and proceeded to scan the airwaves with his laptop, using a program he downloaded form the Internet called Airodump. \"It dumps everything in the air,\" Remnant explained. \"So if I execute the command to start Airodump, instantly I'm seeing probably 20 wireless networks with four or five of those having relatively weak server security.\" \"There are several risks just on this screen,\" he continued. \"One is that we actually don't know whether the public networks are legitimate or not.\" The original survey conducted by AirTight Networks found the most common name for rogue Wi-Fi points was \"Free Public Wi-Fi.\" \"You'd have no idea if somebody sitting down to a laptop was a casual traveler trying to collect their email from an open port, or actually they were setting up a rogue access point,\" Remnant said. \"Your security guys in the airport aren't going to spot someone doing this because it's a technical thing,\" he added. Once connected, the hacker would have access to everything on your screen, from passwords, to bank account details, to the contents of e-mails. Do you suspect you've been a victim of Wi-Fi hacking? Tell us your story in Sound Off . And it's not just happening at airports. The rapid spread of Wi-Fi networks to cafes, hotels and even entire cities is providing hackers with more opportunities to ply their trade. Last month, Venice rolled out what is believed to be Europe's most extensive Wi-Fi network. According to mobile media company Jiwire, there are now more than 273,000 free and pay Wi-Fi locations in 140 countries. The majority can be found in the United States, China, the United Kingdom and France. And most hotspots are located in hotels, along with cafes and restaurants. However, the Wi-Fi Alliance, an industry group that tests and certifies Wi-Fi equipment, says the increased availability of Wi-Fi has not led to a rise in hacking cases. \"We certainly haven't seen any kind of sudden epidemic of hackers in open hotspots or anything like that,\" said the group's marketing director, Kelly Davis-Felner. She said all Wi-Fi enabled devices have in-built security measures, and all users need to do is to switch them on. The most up-to-date wireless security system is WPA2, which provides greater protection than its predecessors WPA and WEP. \"If you're updating Facebook, or checking your personal e-mail or surfing the Web, there's really no reason at all to worry about using an open network,\" Davis-Felner said. \"Any kind of online shopping or banking or anything that would require you to exchange sensitive data over the airwaves, then we advise people to exercise caution.\" The best way to protect sensitive information is to use a Virtual Private Network, or VPN, which encrypts the data moving to and from your laptop. Kiran Deshpande, president of AirTight Networks, had this advice for travelers: \"Connect only to the networks that you trust. Make sure that your communication is secure, disconnect the wireless when you stop using it, and maintain the list of wireless connections that you use on your laptop so that you don't accidentally connect to networks that may spring up when you're traveling.\"\n### Response : ", "target": "Security experts warn Wi-Fi users to be more vigilant against hackers .\nExperts say it's difficult to distinguish between legitimate and rogue networks .\nWi-Fi Alliance says spread of Wi-Fi hasn't led to an 'epidemic' of hacking .\nUsers urged to protect their networks, use VPN for sensitive data .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Bush and Bill Clinton as well as Barack Obama, issued a statement saying, \"It has been an honor to work in the Obama administration and to serve this president, particularly during a period of unprecedented change in the broader Middle East.\" He added, \"Obviously, there is still work to do, but I promised my wife I would return to government for only two years and we both agreed it is time to act on my promise. \"I am grateful to President Obama for having given me the opportunity once again to work on a wide array of Middle Eastern issues and challenges and to support his efforts to promote peace in the region.\" Ross's formal title is special assistant to the president and senior director for the \"central region,\" the key area that includes Israel, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Persian Gulf, and South Asia. His influence is hard to understate, having been handed a portfolio that includes the United States' most pressing national security interests and regions that have undergone significant turmoil over the past two years. Ross' departure comes at a particularly difficult time for the Obama administration, which has at times clashed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the Middle East peace process and is dealing with the unpredictable aftermath of the Arab Spring. The departure also follows that of the special envoy to the Middle East, George Mitchell, who left the administration in May, only days before Netanyahu visited the White House. During his daily briefing Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney called Ross a \"remarkable contributor to this administration.\" \"He is ... very much a part and an architect of the sanctions regime and efforts to pressure and isolate Iran, and has been at the forefront of our deliberations about handling the Arab Spring, the remarkable events we have seen in the Middle East and North Africa this year,\" Carney said.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?(CNN) -- The Icelandic volcano producing the ash cloud snarling much of European air traffic has not stopped erupting. Is there any chance that flight schedules could return to normal any time soon, and does the weather forecast provide any relief? Here are some common questions and answers about the ash cloud crisis. Q: For how long will the volcanic cloud remain in the atmosphere? A: The very fine ash previously injected into higher levels of the atmosphere -- above 20,000 feet -- will remain in the air for \"quite some time,\" because the particles can be removed only by thunderstorms, which are not expected in the next few days, the World Meteorological Organization said Tuesday. The current high pressure system, with weak winds and slowly descending air in the center, is not helping to disperse the ash cloud, the WMO said. Still, the ash particles are slowly descending to lower levels, and there is evidence that most of the ash is now between the ground and about 10,000 feet, the WMO said. Q: What does the weather forecast say? A: The current high-pressure system over Iceland is expected to dissipate toward the end of the week, when a stronger low-pressure system is predicted to develop, the WMO said. Not only will this system change the winds and push the ash toward the Arctic, but the rains associated with this system will help \"wash out\" the ash at lower levels, the WMO said. While that directly affects only the ash in Iceland, it could be good news for the rest of Europe, because some of the ash could be \"washed out\" of the air before it reaches the continent, said CNN weather anchor Mari Ramos. For Ireland and the United Kingdom, upper-level winds coming from the north are not predicted to change any time soon. Any rain that does develop closer to Europe would be unlikely to help wash much of the ash out of the atmosphere, Ramos said, because the ash cloud has generally remained above any weather system. The ash currently being spewed out by the volcano is reaching as high as 20,000 feet. Q: If the weather isn't going to change, when might the volcano stop erupting? A: The eruption will continue for a while, but the activity will become less and less explosive, said volcanologist Simon Day of University College London. The more important question is how long the volcano will continue to send ash high into the atmosphere. \"With the first phases, the ash was going up to 30,000 to 40,000 feet,\" Day said. \"The current levels that the ash is being ejected to is maybe only 10,000 or 20,000 feet. It's probably also coarser-grained ash as well -- it's not quite so finely divided on the whole -- so it's going to settle out faster. So although the eruption may continue for a long time, and we may over the next few months see bursts of explosive activity, it's probably not going to be as much of a problem as it has been during this last week.\" Q: Does the appearance of the volcano's plume indicate anything about the ash? A: The whiteness of the plume suggests it contains mainly steam and little ash, the WMO said. When under-glacier eruptions occur, like this one in Iceland, the volcanoes tend to produce finer particles of ash, which stay in the air longer, Day said. That's because the melting ice shatters the magma, which contains the particles that eventually become ash. Q: What do the ash particles look like? A: The particles are extremely fine -- about as fine as pollen, Day said. They are made up of rocks, minerals, and volcanic glass, which together form volcanic ash, the WMO said. Such ash is hard, does not dissolve in water, and is extremely abrasive and mildly corrosive, the WMO said. Q: Iceland has many volcanoes, so why hasn't this situation happened before? A: The last time an Icelandic volcano produced so much ash over Europe was in 1947, when the Hekla volcano erupted -- but that was when there were fewer planes in the sky and the world wasn't as dependent on air travel as it is now, Day said. Disruption to air travel as a result of volcanoes happens frequently in the northern Pacific, along the Alaska-to-Japan route, where four to five days a year ash levels force flights to be diverted, Day said. But airlines can more easily divert their routes there than they can in Europe.\n### Response :", "target": "Meteorologists: very fine ash in upper atmosphere will remain for \"quite some time\"\nLow-pressure system expected to push ash toward the Arctic, bring rain .\nVolcanologist: Activity will become less and less explosive over time .\nAsh particles are as fine as pollen, but hard, abrasive and mildly corrosive .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.\n### Input:(CNN) -- Thirty-nine years ago, Roe v. Wade was decided. With the passage of nearly four decades, the landscape of abortion has changed in a way that should trouble even those who consider themselves pro-choice. Right now, 10 states and the District of Columbia have no statutory time limit on when abortions can be performed, while five more states allow abortion up to the end of the second trimester (about 27 or 28 weeks). Yet, we know that by 28 weeks, the great majority of fetuses would survive birth. In other words, we allow the killing of viable infants in our country. This is a fact that progressives (including me) would rather not address. As two Maryland abortion doctors face murder charges for allegedly performing late-term abortions, the issue now has a pair of human faces. Drs. Steven Brigham and Nicola Riley were arrested after the discovery of what are alleged to be several viable fetuses in a freezer chest. The story only got stranger on New Year's Day, when a clinic apparently owned by Brigham burned to the ground in Florida. Important facts are still unknown, and the doctors have asserted their innocence regarding any late-term abortions. There has been relatively little discussion of this case in progressive circles. It's no wonder that we would rather look away. The abortion debate has largely devolved into professional activists screaming at each other on television and at street protests. We don't want to be like those people. We are also haunted by the ragged remains of the Supreme Court opinion in Roe v. Wade. Despite being disavowed by subsequent opinions and some of the individual justices, one part of that precedent lives on in the statutes of some states and the practices of several doctors: The assertion in Roe's majority opinion that \"viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks).\" The scientific claim that viability (the ability of a fetus to live outside the womb) \"usually\" occurs at 28 weeks has been undermined by medical advances over the past 38 years. Children who would have died if born late in the second trimester in 1973 would more than likely live if they were born now. A Swedish study in 2009 found that preterm babies born late in the second trimester who are given intensive care survive at surprising rates: 53% of those born at 23 weeks live, 67% at 24 weeks, and by 25 weeks, 82% of the babies survive. (Sweden's health care system makes it possible to reliably track survival rates, but the type of care provided there is similar to that available in the United States). In the same way that the law had to change to accommodate advances in DNA evidence that can exonerate those on death row, state laws must change to accommodate that with modern medical care, a child born at 27 weeks is very likely not only going to live, but live a fairly normal life. We progressives tend to revere science, and there are few scientific proofs more convincing than those former preterm infants who live and thrive all around us. Though late-term abortions are only a small fraction of the total number of terminated pregnancies, it remains a defining issue for our society. As someone who works against the death penalty, trying to save the lives of people who have committed murder, I have a moral obligation to set my feet, breathe in deeply and honestly admit that prosecutors are morally in the right to pursue cases where they believe viable fetuses are being aborted in violation of the law. A life is ended, and that is murder, if the facts so prove. Some will see any accommodation on abortion as \"appeasement\" of conservatives, but this attitude is nothing less than the adoption of hard-line evidence-ignoring tactics that progressives so often (and properly) decry in groups such as the National Rifle Association. We may disagree about whether life begins at conception, but it is now irrefutable that life is viable at 27 weeks. To deny this plainly observable fact is akin to denying the existence of evolution or global warming. Much as Troy Davis (who was executed in Georgia last year despite troubling exculpatory evidence) and Hank Skinner (who received a stay of his execution in Texas to allow DNA testing to be pursued) personified the problems with the death penalty, there are those who do so just as starkly when we ponder late-term abortion. For me, that person is named Rees. On a hot summer day in Waco, Texas, his proud grandfather carried him across the street for me to meet, months after his birth at about 24 weeks. His eyes were clear in the Texas sun, he was wrapped in a blue-and-white blanket, and he was surrounded by love. He was, and is, a person, and that matters as much as Troy Davis and Hank Skinner.

{"source": "### Instruction :Given the following news article, summarize the article:Scientists are concerned about what they're seeing so far this flu season, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday, a day after the agency advised doctors this year's flu vaccine is not as effective because the current strain of the virus has mutated. Dr. Tom Frieden said researchers are worried that with this particular strain of the virus, \"we could have a season that is more severe than most with more hospitalizations and more deaths.\" The advisory sent Wednesday said 52% of the 85 influenza virus samples collected and analyzed from October 1 through November 22 were different than the virus strains included in this year's vaccine, indicating a mutation, or drift, of the strain. The most common strain of the virus reported so far this season is influenza A (H3N2). In the past, this strain has been linked to higher rates of hospitalization and death, especially for those at high risk for complications, which is usually the very young, the elderly and those with chronic health conditions such as asthma or heart problems. In February, a panel of experts decided on 3 strains of the virus to include in this year's vaccine, based on data about the  common strains circulating around the globe throughout the year. Some years the vaccine is a better match to the circulating strains than others. It's too late to create another version of the flu vaccine this year, Frieden said, because even with modern production technology, it typically takes about four months to produce the vaccine. While this year's version is not as protective against a mutated strain, it can still decrease the severity of illness caused by the virus. It can also protect against other circulating strains of the virus, which is why the CDC still recommends getting the vaccine. \"The flu is bad, and you want to do anything you can to prevent getting it and to prevent giving it to other people,\" said Dr. Lisa Thebner, a pediatrician in New York City. \"The vaccine isn't perfect, but it's the best protection we have for prevention.\" When asked if people should be concerned, Thebner said \"people should always be concerned about the flu.\" In a news conference Thursday, Frieden emphasized that if you do start to see flu symptoms -- fever, sore throat, cough, body aches -- it's extremely important to begin taking antiviral medications as soon as possible.  Tamiflu and Relenza have been considered most effective at reducing complications when given soon after symptoms begin. However, he said, most doctors still do not treat people with the antiviral medications, noting that fewer than 1 in 6 people who are severely ill with flu get them. \"It is very important that we do better,\" Frieden said. Antiviral medications can reduce symptoms, shorten the length of time of the illness, and may keep people out of the hospital. So far this year, five children in the United States have died from the flu, Frieden said. In past years, studies have shown 98% of children who do die from flu have not been vaccinated, but it was not clear if the five children Frieden cited were vaccinated. During the 2012-2013 flu season 12,337 people were hospitalized with flu-related illness and 149 children died, according to CDC surveillance data. Ninety percent of those children were not vaccinated. Overall, flu activity across the country is currently low, according to the latest flu outbreak data from the CDC.\n### Response : ", "target": "CDC says mutated flu virus means current flu shot is less protective .\nStill, the CDC recommends people get vaccinated against the flu .\nFlu activity across the country is currently low, CDC says .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction :In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given review.\n### Input:Los Angeles (CNN) -- A judge declared a mistrial Monday in actress Nicollette Sheridan's wrongful termination lawsuit against \"Desperate Housewives\" creator Marc Cherry and ABC. The jury told the judge they were deadlocked at 8-4, in favor of the actress, after three days of deliberations. They needed nine jurors to agree on a verdict. Sheridan sued, claiming her character was killed -- and her acting job eliminated -- in retaliation for her complaining that Cherry hit her during a rehearsal for the ABC comedy. Lawyers for Cherry and ABC's Touchstone Television argued the demise of her character was a creative decision unrelated to the workplace complaint. ABC executives testified that Cherry gained their permission to have Edie Britt -- the sassy blonde played by Sheridan -- die in May 2008, four months before an incident in which Cherry allegedly struck Sheridan. The hit during a rehearsal was just \"a light tap on the head\" intended to demonstrate \"a piece of physical humor\" Cherry wanted Sheridan to perform, the defense said in opening statements. Sheridan testified that Cherry hit her because he was frustrated during a discussion over her lines in a scene. \"It was a nice wallop to my head\" she said. One juror who voted for Sheridan's case said afterward that the defense story \"just didn't hold water for me.\" Beverly Crosby, a retired elementary school principal, said her decision to find the studio liable was based on her doubts about the credibility of several defense witnesses, which included high-level ABC executives. \"There were a lot of people that some of the jurors found not too credible,\" Crosby said. Juror Johnny Huynh, who also voted for Sheridan's side, said it seemed to him that ABC executives scripted their stories \"just a little bit.\" \"I don't say they was scripted,\" Huyhn said. \"It's more like the story don't match for me.\" Sheridan lawyer Mark Baute said while there was no victory, the jury's 8-4 vote did send a message to ABC and parent company Disney. \"They had 10 witnesses tell their little scripted story, with no documents, and eight jurors looked at their best, their presidents, and said, 'No, I'm not buying it, I'm not buying what you're selling, Mr. President,' \" Baute said. Lawyers will now prepare for a retrial, because an out-of-court settlement is not expected, he said. \"My view is that Disney is the unhappiest place on Earth, so why would there ever be a settlement offer?\" Baute said. ABC lawyer Adam Levin said the retrial will be \"far more narrow than the previous case\" since the judge tossed out Sheridan's battery complaint, leaving only the wrongful termination issue against the studio. In fact, Cherry is no longer a defendant, he said. The jury of nine women and three men began deliberating on Wednesday but told the judge on Monday morning they were hopelessly deadlocked. Although the show's line producer reported the hitting incident to the studio's human resources department, there was no investigation until an ABC senior executive saw a National Enquirer story about it at a grocery store two months later, according to testimony. What followed was a \"fake\" investigation designed \"to protect the money machine known as 'Desperate Housewives,'\" Baute said. \"Nobody wants the 'Desperate Housewives' applecart turned upside down.\" The human resources investigator did not interview Cherry or Sheridan about the incident, only three people who worked for Cherry, Baute said. Five months and 11 episodes after the rehearsal incident, Cherry informed Sheridan that Britt would die during a show taping the next day, ending her five-year run on \"Desperate Housewives.\" \"To my estimation, it wasn't handled correctly,\" juror Crosby said. \"It wasn't handled the way it should have been handled.\" Sheridan was asking for $5.7 million in damages from ABC and Cherry, although the actress was paid $4 million in her last year of work and is still earning royalties from her vested interest in the hit series.\n### Response :", "target": "NEW: Juror says she questioned credibility of ABC's witnesses .\nActress Nicollette Sheridan sued the show's creator and ABC for wrongful termination .\nShe claims her firing was in retaliation for complaining she was struck by show's creator .\nThe jury was deadlocked at 8-4, in favor of the actress .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

In this installment, Bob Crowley reports from Boston, Massachusetts. Hardware store owner Brendan Kenney says \"people who have money should go out and spend it.\" BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Brendan Kenney has seen enough bad news about the economy. \"I'm also getting tired of being worried,\" he says. His family has been running a small hardware store in Brookline, Massachusetts, just outside Boston, for about 56 years. He says business has slowed down a little, but mostly because winter is normally the slow time of year for them. Though he hopes the stimulus plan will help his and other small businesses, he believes people shouldn't be afraid. \"I think the American consumer holds a lot of power,\" he continues. \"I think people who have money should go out and spend it.\" Like many in the Boston area, Kenney doesn't want to hear more discouraging stories and sees that as part of the problem. \"It's just negative story after negative story, kind of creating a crisis of confidence.\"  Watch Boston-area reaction to the economic slump \u00bb . South of Boston, Jose Nieto, from Plainville, has his own reasons to be discouraged. Between September and October of last year, he was laid off twice. Nieto, a civil engineer who works on road construction projects, had felt fortunate. After losing his job of 14 years, he was able to find employment after only being out of work for two weeks. After being on the new job for three weeks, however, he got called into the boss's office. \"I said, 'Oh, no. My God, not again.'\" He was faced with looking for work in an industry that traditionally slows down in the winter months. \"It's more than losing your job. It gives you a feeling of rejection,\" he says. Yet, Nieto feels this is a time to learn valuable lessons, especially for those who need to dip into their savings when unemployment checks don't cover all of the bills. \"I think a lot of people will learn from this situation, and, going forward, they'll try to save more money.\" He has been trying to stay healthy, busy and positive. Passing the time working on projects in his basement workshop and taking yoga classes has helped him get through the rough spots, and his luck is turning. He was offered a job that starts in March. \"It is a relief, because I'm employed,\" he says, \"however, I'm taking a job for much less money.\" Nieto believes that most employers cannot afford to hire at the salaries they could offer in the past. Like Kenney's hardware store, Sue Stein's American craft gallery, also in Brookline, is not seeing any major shifts in her business, yet. \"Our business has been certainly down, but not devastating,\" she says. Fire Opal, her gallery, sells everything from earrings to pottery to scarves, all made by artists from around the country. To keep her business healthy, she says, she is trying to make adjustments like buying less merchandise. But she is changing her approach to her customers as well. She says she tries to keep \"understanding that people are having a hard time and trying to find things that are more in their price range.\" Like Kenney and Nieto, Stein is also trying to stay optimistic. \"I think if we all are very careful,\" she says, \"we'll sort of ride it out and then things will adjust.\"\n### Response :", "target": "Hardware store owner in Boston slams \"negative story after negative story\"\nWorker laid off twice in two months says he's trying to stay positive .\nLayoff also brings on feelings of rejection, worker says .\nGallery owner says business is down but not \"devastating\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

These are just some of the most common reports of bribery that can be found in ipaidabribe.or.ke, a recently-launched website dedicated to battling rampant public corruption in Kenya and uncovering its economic impact. The initiative, which was launched last December by Antony Ragui, a 37-year-old financial services consultant, allows victims of graft to share their bribe stories anonymously and track incidents of corruption online. \"I came back to the country from the States about four years ago and I would listen to a lot of Kenyans complain about corruption on social media, on Twitter, on private blogs and I basically got tired of it,\" says Ragui. \"I said now it's time for me to do something different.\" Read more: Crooked top officials should take a fall, says Kenyan corruption chief . Based on a similar site launched a few years ago in India to curb corruption, Ragui's online platform is divided in three categories, containing detailed information about the amount of money paid and the location of the bribe. The first section contains stories about bribes that were paid, breaking down the numbers by region and government department. The second collects stories from people who refused to pay a bribe, while the third contains stories of honesty, where citizens were not asked to pay a public official. Until now, Ragui's site has hosted nearly 600 cases of, mainly petty, bribery worth around 17 million Kenyan shillings (\u00c2\u00a3204,000). \"Corruption is a huge issue: it's so endemic and the worst part about it is it becomes a way of life,\" says Ragui, who's also about to roll out an SMS service that will allow citizens to report their stories instantaneously via their mobile phones. \"So what I'm trying to do with the site essentially is to get people to create a network of anti-corruption people -- people who feel that this has to come to an end and we need to make a difference.\" Opinion: Can Kenya avoid Africa's resource curse? According to anti-corruption group Transparency International, Kenya is one of the world's most corrupt countries. The group's 2011 East African Bribery Index said that there is a 67% chance that Kenyans would be expected to pay a bribe every time they interacted with the police. Overall, the cost of corruption in Africa is estimated at more than $148 billion a year, according to African Union estimates. Yet ipaidabribe.or.ke is not the only attempt to use information technology as a tool in the fight against corruption in Africa as an increasing number of similar websites have popped up across the continent. Also based on India's I Paid A Bribe, Bribe Nigeria was set up last summer by Leonard Raphael to raise awareness about corruption and address its impact on the West African country. \"Corruption is an endemic disease that has eaten up every facet of the Nigerian society,\" says Raphael, pointing to the case of a father who was asked by police officers to give them money for fuel after they came to his house to search for his son who was just kidnapped. \"As soon as corruption can be controlled in Nigeria, every other sustainable development can henceforth progress,\" adds Raphael. In South Africa, Corruption Watch was launched in late January in a bid to encourage people to join their voices against the problem. So far, the group says it has collected some 1,200 reports from all corners of the country through its online reporting form, an SMS line, social media and by email or post. \"It's designed principally to show to people that by reporting and by speaking up something can happen,\" says the group's executive director David Lewis. \"The way of changing things in a democracy is to speak up and to speak as much as possible with a connected voice,\" he adds.

Ben Elers, director of programs at Transparency International, says that all these initiatives can be a powerful tool in the fight against corruption. \"I think they are essential in giving citizens a voice, they're enabling them to voice their frustrations,\" he says. He adds, however, that since the complaints are generally anonymous, it can be difficult to follow up on them. \"Ultimately they are tools and what happens afterwards in changing the physical world is what counts at the end of the day,\" he says. \"So, they are critical but in of themselves they're not sufficient, they need concrete follow-up afterwards.\" Back in Kenya, Ragui is optimistic that the use of technology can help things change. \"Kenyans are tired,\" he says. \"We need a new generation of Kenyans who are actually positive, hard-working, people who don't want to get a short-term gain, people who are actually thinking the only way to make a difference in our country is for people to say no to corruption.\"\n### Response :", "target": "African activists are increasingly turning to technology to fight endemic corruption .\nWebsites allow victims of graft to share their bribe stories online and track incidents of corruption .\nThey contain detailed information about the amount of money paid and the location of the bribe .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

All nine people who were aboard the Mi-8 helicopter near Slovyansk are believed to have died, said Vladislav Seleznev, spokesman for Ukraine's anti-terror operation. A missile fired from a man-portable air-defense system hit the helicopter, Seleznev said. Afterward, the militants who brought down the aircraft hid in a nearby village, Bylbasovka, according to Seleznev. Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in a tense standoff since March when Russia annexed the previously Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and massed troops along other parts of its border with Ukraine. Ukraine's government in Kiev has accused Russia of allowing weapons and military equipment to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-Russia separatists, who have led uprisings in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Friday declared a cease-fire with pro-Russia separatists, saying military units would respond only if they're attacked. He warned militants to abandon their weapons before the cease-fire expires on June 27. The cease-fire includes the closure of the Ukraine-Russia border, and Poroshenko called for changes to Ukraine's Constitution to decentralize power. Russian President Vladimir Putin last week welcomed the cease-fire and said it \"should be used to begin constructive negotiations and political compromises between the opponent parties in eastern Ukraine,\" according to the Kremlin. On Tuesday, Putin asked Russia's upper house of Parliament to cancel a March 1 resolution that authorizes Russia to use force in Ukraine, state-run news agency ITAR-Tass reported. Lawmakers had passed that resolution weeks before Russia annexed Crimea. Russia's annexation of Crimea and the pro-Russian uprising in eastern Ukraine came after Ukraine's Parliament ousted Viktor Yanukovych from the presidency on February 22. Yanukovych's departure came after months of protests in Kiev -- demonstrations motivated in part by his decision to back out of a trade deal with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia.\n### Response :", "target": "Militants hit helicopter with missile, Ukrainian spokesman says .\nAll nine aboard are believed to have been killed, spokesman says .\nAttack comes less than week after Ukraine's President declared cease-fire with separatists .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?LONDON, England (CNN) -- London's newest hotelier Mark Fuller is showing commendable bravado for someone about to open a luxury hotel during a global recession. Entrepreneur Mark Fuller in the Sanctum Soho hotel, a rock'n'roll \"haven of hedonism\" in London. \"F*** the recession, let's get on with it,\" he says, while sitting on the roof terrace of the Sanctum Soho, a 30-room establishment dubbed the rock'n'roll hotel, as much for its \"anything goes\" service philosophy as the pedigree of its owners, which include the co-managers of heavy metal band Iron Maiden. \"We do not recognize there is a credit crunch because we believe you should battle through it,\" Fuller says, adding, \"If you get panicky and scary about things like this, you're no man at all.\" Besides, he admits, three years ago when he started working on the concept of an 'alluring haven of hedonism' (as the hotel is described on its Web site), the credit crunch didn't exist. And by the time it hit, it was too late to pull out. \"We wouldn't do anyway,\" Fuller insists, adding \"fortune favors the brave, as they say.\"  See images of the rock star hotel \u00bb . The former band manager turned entrepreneur, is looking quite the rock star tonight, decked head-to-toe in black while a shiny silver skull stares ominously from his belt buckle. Downstairs, staff are frantically preparing for a launch party that promises to be heavy on champagne, cocktails and celebrities. It's almost like the crunch doesn't exist. This is Fuller's world and he's hoping plenty of people will want to join it. \"In every downturn in the economic climate I think people look for some affordable glamour and escape,\" he says. Fuller also owns and runs the Embassy Hotel, an exclusive nightclub in the upmarket London suburb of Mayfair which he plans to franchise in Dubai, Istanbul and Abu Dhabi. The partners in his new hotel venture ooze rock credential: Iron Maiden co-managers Rod Smallwood and Andy Taylor. While Taylor has experience running a restaurant and hotel, \"The Inn on the Green,\" Smallwood's experience in the hotel industry is based on 30 years on the road with Iron Maiden. Last year he stayed in 80 hotels in 40 countries and one of his biggest gripes is returning to his hotel after a gig and finding the bar is closed. \"You want good service, and you want the bars open, and you want good food available,\" he says from the roof terrace equipped with a bar and Jacuzzi he's taken to calling \"my lounge.\" Smallwood expects to stay in the hotel once a week and says it will become a London bolt-hole for the band. While non-music types and the tone-deaf are welcome to stay in the hotel, over-enthusiastic groupies are not. \"If you're on the road for three months, you can never escape,\" Smallwood says. \"The fans, some of them, think they have a God-given right, just because they're staying in the same hotel, to put a camera in your face over your cornflakes.\" \"The rule here is no autographs and no photographs,\" he says firmly. \"Say Paul Weller is sitting in the corner having a beer, and you go and ask for an autograph or photograph, you will not stay here again.\" Along with privacy and a beer at all hours, guests have access to an on-call guitar doctor, a necessity, apparently, if you break a string while strumming in your room. Guests who have inadvertently left their guitar at home can hire one from reception. The rock star concept extends to the room decor. The silver wallpaper and mirrored columns may appear garish in daylight, but at 3 a.m. one suspects they add a touch of glamour. Free standing baths are a bold leap from the bed and the mini bar is well-stocked with champagne. Rod Smallwood is confident the concept will work. \"Recession or no recession, we're talking about 30 rooms in a huge major city. If we can't sell 30 rooms in the depths of recession it means we're useless, and we know we're not.\" Mark Fuller says he's selling more than a hotel room. In times of economic crisis the Sanctum Soho offers the chance to forget the mortgage and live like a rock star, if only for a day. \"You can sit in the restaurant and have a hamburger for seven pounds ($10),\" he says. \"The drinks are cheaper than most hotels, and probably cheaper than most nightclubs. The room accommodation runs everywhere from \u00a3125 ($255) straight up to \u00a3450 ($650). Take your pick. Cut your coat.\" I mishear him. \"Cut your coke?\" I ask. \"No, you can't do that!\" he exclaims. \"Musicians are not like that anymore,\" Fuller says. \"The music industry is such now that people release CDs to support tours, not the other way around, so this is a professional state. \"I just don't want to be the hotel at the end of the tour, then I'm in danger,\" he laughs.\n### Response:", "target": "Entrepreneur braves recession to open rock'n'roll hotel in London's Soho .\nSanctum Soho offers roof terrace with 24 hour bar, Jacuzzi, guitar doctors .\nRooms sparkle with silver wallpaper, free standing baths and champagne .\nBackers include Iron Maiden co-managers Rod Smallwood and Andy Taylor .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

But John Raucci, assistant director of the FBI's Human Resources Division, says current needs are much more wide-ranging. \"We're also looking for professionals in a wide variety of fields who have a deep desire to help protect our nation from terrorists, spies and others who wish us harm,\" Raucci said.

George Bastl beats Pete Sampras, Wimbledon 2002 Swiss player Bastl was ranked 145 in the world when he took on the seven-time champion of Wimbledon, Pete Sampras. Bastl, who only got into the tournament as a lucky loser after failing to qualify, beat the American in five sets. 4. Mark Edmondson wins the 1976 Australian Open  The Australian only ever won one Grand Slam event, and he beat defending champion John Newcombe in the final to do it. The most remarkable point however, was that he was ranked 212th in the world when he did it. He remains the lowest-ranked player to win a Grand Slam title. 5. Goran Ivanisevic wins 2001 Wimbledon Left-handed Ivanisevic had lost the Wimbledon final three times before he finally won it in 2001. The eventual victory was a near-miracle, as he had only entered the tournament as a wild card. Ranked outside the top 100 at the time, he became the lowest-ranked player and only wild card to win Wimbledon. 6. Mats Wilander wins the 1982 French Open  The young Swede shocked the tennis world when at 17 years of age he beat the second, third, fourth and fifth seeds at Roland Garros to win the tournament. He was unseeded for the event. 7. Richard Krajicek beats Pete Sampras, Wimbledon 1996 Krajicek surprised everyone when he became the first Dutchman to win Wimbledon in 1996, but the biggest upset had come when he defeated Pete Sampras in the quarter-final. His win was Sampras' only loss at the grass tournament between 1993 and 2001. 8. Gustavo Kuerten wins the 1997 French Open It's no surprise that \"Guga\" was a Roland Garros favorite. When he won the 1997 tournament he was ranked 66th in the world and he beat three former champions along the way. He remains the third-lowest ranked Grand Slam champion. 9. Lleyton Hewitt beats Andre Agassi while ranked #550 The Australian went on to win his first ATP tour title after beating Agassi in the semi-final of the Adelaide International. The win over former world number one Agassi was remarkable given that he was ranked at 550th and only 16 years old. 10.

The attack at a security checkpoint in the city of Saidu Sharif injured 37, according to Ibrahim Khan, a police official in the Swat District, where the military launched an offensive against the Taliban last year. The city is near Mingora, the largest city in the district. Khan said the suicide attacker, who was dropped off on a rickshaw, approached a checkpoint manned by police and military personnel. Security personnel opened fire when the attacker refused to stop. Moments later, the attacker detonated explosives. Azam Tariq, a spokesman for the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, told CNN by phone that his organization takes responsibility for the deadly blasts in Lahore on Friday and the attack Saturday. The Saturday blast comes a day after a twin suicide bombing on a military convoy in Lahore killed 44 people and injured nearly 100 others. Assailants targeted military convoys, approaching on foot and detonating their explosives 15 to 20 seconds apart, Punjab Law Minister Rana Sana Ullah said. Five of the dead were Pakistani soldiers, he said. \"Pakistan has become a colony of Blackwater,\" Tariq said, referring to the company now known as Xe Services that provided security to U.S. officials in Iraq. \"The government of Pakistan has become puppet of U.S,\" he added. Tariq warned that failure to halt operations against the Taliban will lead to more attacks. \"Our 2,000 suicide bombers, who have already spread across the country, will act against security personnel and government installations,\" Tariq said. Tariq said the attacks on both days were a retaliation for the killing of innocent \"Mujahedeen\" by Pakistani government under the orders of the United States. A Pakistani crackdown on militants has resulted in the arrests of top Taliban. After the twin bombings Friday, a series of low-level blasts occurred in succession in the Iqbal Town area of the city that night. Three people were injured in the blasts and damage was minimal, Lahore Police said. Earlier this week, gunmen entered a North West Frontier Province compound of the humanitarian agency World Vision, threw grenades, opened fire on the staff inside and detonated a homemade bomb before leaving, according to a World Vision statement. Journalists Nazar Ul Islam and Nasir Dawar contributed to this report.\n### Response : ", "target": "Pakistan Taliban claims responsibility for deadly suicide bombing .\nAttack in Mingora on Saturday kills 13 and injured dozens, police say .\nSaturday blast comes day after twin suicide bombing in Lahore killed 44 people .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.(CNN) -- Veteran character actor Ralph Waite -- who many knew best from his time on \"The Waltons,\" though he also had regular roles in more recent series like \"Bones\" and \"NCIS\" -- has died. He was 85. Waite died on Thursday afternoon at his Palm Desert, California, home, according to Steve Gordon, his family accountant. Jane Mead, a representative of the Spirit of the Desert Presbyterian Fellowship that Waite attended regularly, confirmed his death. According to IMDB.com, Waite was already a Hollywood veteran with parts in movies like \"Cool Hand Luke\" and \"Five Easy Pieces,\" plus TV series such as \"Bonanza\" when he landed the role of John Walton Sr. \"The Waltons\" struck a chord with many viewers during its run from 1972 to 1981, with Waite being a constant on that show as well as in several TV movies to follow. Waite was twice nominated for an Emmy, first in 1977 for supporting actor in a comedy or drama series for \"Roots\" and the next year as lead actor in a drama for his Waltons' role. Waite also tried his hand at politics, running unsuccessfully as a Democrat for a U.S. representative seat that includes Palm Springs -- narrowly losing in 1990 and again in 1998 to Mary Bono, the widow of former congressman and \"Sonny and Cher\" star Sonny Bono. These forays didn't stop Waite from continuing his day job, however. He continued to score regular roles, for instance, on TV shows like \"The Mississippi,\" \"Murder One,\" \"Carnivale,\" \"The Practice\" and \"Grey's Anatomy.\" In fact, Waite was busy working right through last year playing recurring characters on not only \"Bones\" and \"NCIS\" but also \"Days of Our Lives.\" Stephan Nathan, \"Bones\" executive producer, remembered Waites as \"a wonderful man.\" \"A big loss,\" Nathan tweeted. \"RIP.\" Pauley Perrette, part of the \"NCIS\" cast, also tweeted condolences for the man she referred to as Papa Gibbs. \"We love him at NCIS SO much,\" Perrette said. \"So so sad.\" People we've lost in 2014 .\n### Response: ", "target": "Ralph Waite dies at his Palm Desert, California, home, two sources say .\nHe was a veteran Hollywood actor, having appeared in many movies and TV series .\nHe was best known as John Walton Sr. on the hit show \"The Waltons\"\nWaite worked well into his 80s on shows like \"Bones\" and \"NCIS\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given review.It's not the Occupy Wall Street protesters yelling \"mic check\" who are bugging Newt Gingrich at his events these days. It's the attack ads occupying the airwaves in Iowa. A new spot from the pro-Mitt Romney super political action committee Restore Our Future starts with the simple question: \"Know what makes Barack Obama happy?\" The answer: \"Newt Gingrich's baggage.\" In the ad, luggage bearing the names of the former speaker's past liabilities then spills out onto an airline baggage carousel. \"Newt has more baggage than the airlines,\" the ad says. The spot doesn't mention Gingrich's personal baggage. But it might as well. Gingrich has demanded that Romney call on the super PAC to pull its negative ads. \"I object to lies. I object to negative smear campaigns,\" Gingrich said Tuesday. But Romney makes no apologies. \"If you can't stand the relatively modest heat in the kitchen right now, wait until Obama's hell's kitchen shows up,\" Romney said in New Hampshire on Wednesday. Unfortunately for the former speaker, it's about to get hotter. The 2012 campaign is now a high stakes version of Pac-Man. In the battle of Romney versus Gingrich, guess who the ghost is? The Restore Our Future super PAC is not only run by former Romney political operatives. It also is funded in large part by big donors who still work at Romney's former investment firm, Bain Capital. None of this is a mystery to Gingrich. \"We need to understand that these are his people, running his ads, doing his dirty work, while he pretends to be above it,\" Gingrich said Tuesday. According to an analysis of disclosure forms from Restore Our Future conducted by the nonpartisan government watchdog Center for Responsive Politics, the pro-Romney super PAC has spent $430,380 on ads in Iowa. That's more than the $325,770 spent by the Romney campaign. Combined, they are outspending Gingrich in Iowa by more than seven to one. Bain employees have given $1.25 million  to Restore Our Future. Contrast that to the $84,500 contributed by Bain employees directly to the Romney campaign. Contributions to federal candidates are limited to $2,500. There are no limits on donations to super PAC's. That's part of what makes them super. In its landmark 2010 decision in the case of \"Citizens United vs. the Federal Election Commission,\" the U.S. Supreme Court green-lighted the activities of super PAC's, effectively allowing them to legally raise and spend unlimited amounts of money. Viveca Novak with the Center for Responsive Politics said Bain's connection to \"Restore Our Future\" gives Romney a clear advantage in the race. \"He automatically has access to extraordinary amounts of money through these individuals who are connected to securities and investment firms, which are part of the world he used to inhabit,\" Novak said. Romney has suggested he has no legal authority to pull the super PAC spots. \"My goodness, if we coordinate in any way whatsoever, we go to the big house,\" Romney said in an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" Novak said Romney could do more. \"If Romney wanted to he could call a press conference and call on the super PAC to take down the ad,\" Novak said. Romney defended \"Restore Our Future\" by pointing to the pro-Obama super PAC, Priorities USA, which has already started attacking his campaign. That PAC, run by former White House Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton, has one spot featuring a now infamous photo of Romney during his days at Bain. The picture shows Romney in a suit stuffed with money. As Romney has pointed out, the president's advisers have set their fundraising goal at $1 billion. The Romney campaign said its own spots are positive. Its latest ad stars Romney's wife, Ann, who extols the virtues of good moral character. \"If you really want to know how a person will operate, look at how they've lived their life,\" Ann Romney says in the ad. That sounds like another subtle swipe at Gingrich, who  has a new ad featuring his wife, Callista. \"From our family to yours, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year,\" she says in the spot. With super PAC fever spreading, a little holiday cheer doesn't hurt.\n### Response :", "target": "\"Super\" political action committees are spending millions of dollars on ads in Iowa .\nOne group supporting Romney has been attacking Newt Gingrich .\nA recent Supreme Court ruling allows those PACs to spend unlimited money in a campaign .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?(CNN) -- Could you catch a wild gorilla? What about a person dressed as a gorilla? This week, staff at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo practiced capturing escaped animals by chasing around one of their colleagues wearing a gorilla suit. Visitors gaped as scores of helmet-wearing keepers surrounded the \"gorilla\" with cars and nets. Staff then pretended to tranquilize their coworker, who swooned dramatically and collapsed to the ground. The acting ape was immediately wrapped in a large net and hauled away on a truck. The escaped animal drill at the Tokyo zoo is conducted every other year, and this time zookeeper Natsumi Uno was chosen to wear the animal costume. \"In our work there may be times when we need to capture an animal, but we would never be the ones being captured,\" Uno told reporters. \"So I tried to feel what an animal might feel and realized when they were on the run they would be scared. That's how I felt.\" But some onlookers were barely moved. One Japanese user posted on Twitter, \"Ueno Zoo's escape drill wasn't tense at all.\" Another wrote, \"The gorilla escape drill was so laid back! Made me laugh.\" The practice is part of the city's earthquake preparedness drills, where city workers prepare for scenarios that may occur in the event of an earthquake. That includes capturing raging beasts. In the past, the Ueno Zoo has tried using different animal outfits: In 2004, two men ran around the zoo while wearing a giant papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 rhinoceros over their heads. The technique isn't just Japanese -- in 2012, the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, Massachusetts practiced capturing an employee in a giraffe costume.

Badawi had appealed his original 2013 conviction, which carried a sentence of seven years in prison and 600 lashes, for insulting Islam and violating the Kingdom's anti-cybercrime laws. That verdict was overturned by an appeals court and a retrial was ordered. Badawi plans to appeal this new decision, said the source, who wished to remain anonymous. \"This is terrible news and I'm absolutely shocked and devastated by it,\" said Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haider. \"How is it possible they could take a sentence that was already so harsh and make it even harsher? Ten years in jail and 1,000 lashes? That's unimaginable. I'm extremely scared for my husband.\" The judgment also included a 1 million riyal fine, which is equal to about $267,000. Despite repeated attempts, CNN was unable to reach Saudi Arabia's Justice Ministry for comment. Badawi, a respected rights activist in Saudi Arabia, first got into legal hot water with the Saudi government after starting a liberal website and forum where users could discuss religion. His trial, guilty verdict, sentence and imprisonment has caused immense outrage among international rights groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, who accused Saudi authorities of cracking down on activism and attempting to quell dissent in the ultraconservative nation. Amnesty International called Wednesday's judgment outrageous and called for the conviction to be overturned. \"He is a prisoner of conscience who is guilty of nothing more than daring to create a public forum for discussion and peacefully exercising the right to freedom of expression.,\" said Philip Luther, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Amnesty International. In the last few months, the Saudi government has passed a series of very strong anti-terror laws that many rights groups fear will be used, among other things, as a way to quash dissent . Last year, prominent rights and reform activists Mohammed Al-Qahtani and Abdullah Al-Hamid were each sentenced to 10 years in prison. Badawi's appeal will be complicated because his attorney and brother-in-law, Waleed Abulkhair, recently was put on trial for undermining the image of the kingdom and breaking allegiance with the King. Last month, he was detained without explanation during his trial and has been jailed since, according to numerous rights activists and his wife, Samar Badawi.

{"source": "### Instruction :Can you give me a quick rundown?\n### Input:(Rolling Stone) -- John Mellencamp's 25th album, \"No Better Than This,\" continues the thread of American archaeology that he began on \"Trouble No More,\" a self-produced 2003 set of traditional songs and covers. But where \"Trouble\" was a first brush with history -- Mellencamp trying to make it come to him -- here he meets that history on its home ground. A set of old-school originals recorded in resonant settings (Sun Studio in Memphis; the First African Baptist Church in Savannah; a hotel room in San Antonio where Robert Johnson cut some classic sides), \"No Better\" shows Mellencamp channeling spirits and stepping into period styles. They fit him perfectly. Producer T Bone Burnett rides shotgun, and the duo keep it simple: an old Ampex reel-to-reel tape recorder, a single vintage ribbon mic, a small group of empathetic players. They include ex-Tom Waits guitarist Mark Ribot; Jay Bellerose, whose rhythms shaped Robert Plant and Alison Krauss' Raising Sand; and stand-up bassist David Roe, who played with Johnny Cash at the end of his life. Mellencamp's songs show a writer still on a hot streak after 2008's Burnett-produced \"Life, Death, Love and Freedom,\" arguably the singer-songwriter's best LP since his 80s heyday. He shoots for timeless here: Aside from an allusion to an answering machine on the Woody Guthrie-style \"Thinking About You,\" these songs could have all been written 50 years ago or more. \"Save Some Time to Dream\" is a gentle folk sermon with a dash of existential doubt. The swinging \"Right Behind Me\" considers Jesus and the devil -- \"both inside of me/All the time\" -- with Miriam Sturm's jazzy Hot Club fiddle. Considering the title, Mellencamp has made a remarkably dark record. \"No One Cares About Me\" is about a guy out of work, ditched by his wife, mourning a father, a son and his only friend, over an old-timey hillbilly strut. The lead character in \"A Graceful Fall,\" a stumpy waltz, is also penniless, \"sick of life\" and pondering the afterlife, \"if there is really one.\" The dude in \"Each Day of Sorrow\" insists he would kill himself \"if I weren't so afraid.\" But as usual, Mellencamp is at his best when he turns hardscrabble struggle into damn-the-torpedoes rock & roll. On the title track, a classic Sun Records \"boom-chick-boom\" romp, Mellencamp runs through a list of fantasies, some quite reasonable, before concluding that \"it won't get no better than this\" -- however relatively [expletive]-up \"this\" might be. Welcome to life in 21st-century America, ladies and gentlemen: Let's party like it's 1929. \"No Better Than This\" isn't a perfectly honed set. But Mellencamp has never sounded looser or easier on a record. The most indelible moments are straight-up funny. \"Love at First Sight\" imagines a relationship from back-seat grope through marriage, kids and subsequent disasters, before deciding it might be better to go home alone. And on \"Easter Eve,\" a man and his 14-year-old son get hassled in a cafe, slash a [expletive] up, get thrown in jail, then walk off with the dude's grateful wife. It's musical storytelling for hard times: far-fetched, violent, sexy, played for laughs. It doesn't get more timeless, or American, than that.

11 ] . using a model similar to that of endotoxin tolerance \n , the authors attempted to mimic vap pathogenesis by using augmenting concentrations of gram - negative bacteria to sequentially stimulate ex vivo peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) isolated from healthy volunteers and assessed their apoptosis parameters . \n an increase in cd14 monocyte apoptosis was observed when compared with non - stimulated pbmcs and pbmcs that had only a unique bacterial challenge with the highest concentration of bacterial inoculum used . \n moreover , a question raised by the results is whether lymphocyte depletion , monocyte apoptosis , and monocyte anergy in vap are immunoparalysis markers that could be used as prognostic factors or are underlying dysregulations that contribute to the pathogenesis of vap . \n although patients in the two groups did not differ significantly in terms of age , disease severity , underlying conditions , diabetes mellitus , corticosteroid use , the presence of other recent infections , or additional factors that may affect the immune response to sepsis , the duration of critical illness prior to enrollment was not reported \n . it would be reasonable to expect a more frequent occurrence of longer hospitalization , surgery , trauma , neurosurgical conditions , or other critical illness prior to the development of septic shock in the group of patients with vap . \n thus , it is hard to know whether any of the above -

The CalSky website sends me alerts for potential fly overs for which I\u2019ve been waiting a long time \u2013 about 12 months. I got one this week and this was adjusted by 15 seconds by the time of the \u201coccultation\u201d. \n  \n If you think that it might be a case of sitting there with your camera and a clock, with one hand on the shutter release, you\u2019d be absolutely correct! The ISS only passed over the moon for 0.33 seconds as it shoots by quite quickly. Knowing the second it would pass I fired a \u201cburst\u201d mode of exposures then crossed my fingers and hoped it would show up in review \u2013 and it did! \n  \n The setup was my Canon 70D attached to the rear cell of my Celestron 9.25\u2033 telescope (2350mm / f10). The shutter speed was a quick 1/1650th of a second and ISO 800 in order to freeze the ISS in motion. \n  \n I took about a second of further exposures on either side of the pass to stack the lunar surface detail using AutoStakkert2, and the increased the saturation in post to create this colour enhanced version of the moon. The colours on the moon relate to the chemical composition of moon geology. \n  \n Here is a close up so you can see the modules and the solar arrays captured fairly clearly! \n  \n UPDATE : This kinda went viral on all the major social networks.

At such speeds the weightless research laboratory was visible for only about a third of a second before returning to the dark skies. \n  \n Dylan captured the moment in Byron Bay, New South Wales, the eastern-most point of Australia, where the absence of larger towns offers low levels of light pollution. \n  \n The image was taken on 30 June 2015 at 19:54 local time with the Space Station flying 400 km above the Pacific Ocean. A conventional camera was placed behind a 2300 mm / f10 telescope and Dylan took as many pictures as possible during the Station\u2019s brief passage and hoped for the best. \n  \n Five images of the Moon taken before and after the Station passed by were processed using freely available astrophotography tools to improve sharpness, a process called stacking. Lastly, the colours were enhanced to bring out the Moon\u2019s colourful surface geology. \n  \n This is the first picture of the Station Dylan has published, commenting, \u201cI take many types of pictures but the International Space Station is a wonderful target and one I\u2019ve wanted to capture for a long time.\u201d \n  \n Spotting the orbital complex yourself is easier than you might think. It can be seen and photographed without special equipment as it passes overhead. As it moves so fast, the hard part is to know when and where to look. ESA\u2019s tracker shows you where the Station is at any time and you can sign up to receive alerts for your neighbourhood here. \n  \n Once you know where the Space Station will be, it is best to wait for dawn or dusk. It looks like a very bright star or aircraft gliding through the sky. For less advanced pictures without using the Moon as a background, use a tripod and set the shutter speed to a long exposure of up to a minute. The Station will always arrive from the west and will appear as a white streak in the photograph. |||||\n### Response : ", "target": "\u2013 All it took for Dylan O'Donnell to capture this image from his perch in southeastern Australia of the International Space Station (visible in the upper-right part of the frame) passing in front of the moon: a Canon camera set to burst mode, a Celestron telescope, and a quick eye, per his website. The European Space Agency says the amateur photographer took the photo on June 30 as the ISS, soaring 250 miles above the Earth, flew by at almost 18,000mph, meaning it was only in view for about a third of a second. O'Donnell credits alerts from an online astronomical calendar for letting him know when the space station does its \"flyovers,\" noting he had been waiting a full year for this photo op. \"If you think that it might be a case of sitting there with your camera and a clock, with one hand on the shutter release, you'd be absolutely correct!\" he notes.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?Miami, Florida (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Paula pushed across western Cuba Thursday evening with wind gusts just under hurricane strength in some places, bringing heavy rain and high winds to the island nation, forecasters said. The storm is gradually weakening and is expected to become a tropical depression Friday, the Miami, Florida-based National Hurricane Center said . As of 8 p.m. ET, the center of Paula was about 25 miles (45 kilometers) east of Havana, the center said. It was moving east at 14 mph (22 kph). Paula passed just south of the Cuban capital around 6 p.m. Thursday -- with sustained winds of 41 mph (67 kph) and a gust of 54 mph (87 kph) recorded in Havana -- after making landfall at about noon near Puerto Esperanza. The storm's maximum sustained winds have weakened to 55 mph (90 kph), the center said Thursday night, but wind gusts of 68 mph had been recorded earlier near Puerto Esperanza. Stronger gusts were confined to a small area near the storm's center, the center said. Paula's tropical storm-force winds have expanded to 70 miles (110 km) outward from the center, altering the landscape of a storm that has been roughly half that size for most of its duration. Forecasters said the storm was likely to stick to an east to east-northeast track, moving across western and central Cuba Thursday night and Friday. The hurricane center said that tropical storm force winds should continue to spread eastward across western and central Cuba Thursday night, primarily along the north coast. The center discontinued an earlier tropical storm watch also was for the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas. Emergency management officials in the Keys said Wednesday they were keeping an eye on the progress of Paula and expected some gusty winds and rain, but no protective actions had been initiated. Forecasters predict the center of Paula will remain south of the Keys. Paula is likely to dump an additional 2 to 4 inches of rain over portions of western and central Cuba over the next two days, the National Hurricane Center said. Total maximum amounts could be 10 inches in some areas. Heavy rain could trigger flash floods and mudslides, forecasters said. The Florida Keys could see between 1 and 2 inches of rain. In addition, a storm surge is forecast to raise water levels by 2 to 4 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba, accompanied by \"large and destructive waves,\" the hurricane center said.\n### Response:", "target": "NEW: Storm is gradually weakening, with maximum sustained winds of 55 mph (90 kph)\nTropical Storm Paula pushes across western Cuba .\nPaula could become a tropical depression on Friday .\nForecasters say the storm could bring rain to parts of the Florida Keys .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?One of the most anticipated Supreme Court decisions in recent times -- Obamacare -- was not announced Monday. That gave an air of anti-climax to an important decision that was handed down, one with its own political baggage and implications for the election, although not nearly as fraught with peril as the health care law. In any other session, the outcome of Arizona v. United States might have been the headline case of a Supreme Court season. Instead, the Obama administration will have to celebrate an incomplete victory in the next 72 hours before the court delivers its ruling on the fate of Obama's signature legislation. The White House largely won in challenging Arizona's harsh 2010 immigration law, although it might be difficult to sell that point. Last year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down four provisions of the law, ruling that the federal government pre-empted state regulation on immigration. The Supreme Court mostly agreed. Unfortunately for the administration, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court on the most controversial part of the law, the \"show me your papers\" provision that requires law enforcement officers to check the immigration status of people while enforcing other laws. Arguably, this provision was designed to force the federal government to take action on illegal immigrants by identifying them to the Department of Homeland Security. By upholding this provision, the Supreme Court allowed Gov. Jan Brewer to claim victory for Arizona's immigration enforcement efforts: . \"Today's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is a victory for the rule of law. It is also a victory for the 10th Amendment and all Americans who believe in the inherent right and responsibility of states to defend their citizens. After more than two years of legal challenges, the heart of SB 1070 can now be implemented in accordance with the U.S. Constitution.\" But that narrow win is tenuous. The court pointedly did not rule that the provision was constitutional, which means that further court cases may well strike it down at a later date. Arizona can put it into effect, but it probably won't take too much time before a case comes up that will put the provision back under scrutiny. The White House will portray the Supreme Court's ruling on immigration as a principled victory over a state that had infringed on federal prerogatives to manage immigration. It may even get a couple of days' worth of traction on that argument.  That won't last long, though, for two reasons. First, the coming Obamacare ruling will vastly overshadow this nuanced win by Thursday morning. Second, this win serves as a reminder that the Obama administration has done a poor job of enforcing immigration law -- and along with Obama's recent decision to stop deporting some young illegal immigrants -- border states have no reason to expect a second term that will improve on the first.\n### Response : ", "target": "Ed Morrissey: High court ruling on Arizona immigration law is largely a win for president .\nMorrissey: Ruling is an incomplete win since the fate of Obamacare coming within days .\nCase is a reminder Obama has done a poor job of enforcing immigration law, he says .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Produce an article summary of the following news article:Doc to summarize:\n### Input:(CNN) -- European leaders meeting in Brussels Thursday need to send Russia an unmistakeable signal that its military intervention in Ukraine will not be tolerated. The consequences of failing to act firmly would have a negative impact far beyond the European Union's eastern neighborhood. One country waiting quietly to see if Vladimir Putin gets away with his de facto land grab in Crimea is China, a growing military power locked in a series of territorial disputes with the countries around it. There is too much at stake for the lesson that borders can be unilaterally changed by force to be allowed to stand. An important starting point is for EU policy makers to understand that Russia acted out of weakness rather than strength. Faced with the loss of a friendly regime in his own back yard, Putin lashed out without any real thought for the consequences. There are already signs that he realizes he overplayed his hand. In his press conference on Tuesday, the Russian President stressed the limited and temporary nature of his goals, professed friendship towards Ukraine and even expressed sympathy for the protestors who overthrew his Ukrainian ally, Viktor Yanukovych. The reason for this is clear. Putin wants to rebuild his influence over Ukraine as a whole and recognizes that the occupation of Crimea is more likely to unite the country against him. A second factor giving him pause for thought will have been the reaction of the markets in weakening the ruble and wiping billions from the value of Russian businesses. Russia's economic difficulties were already beginning to mount before this crisis broke. Growth is stagnant and likely to remain so. Little progress has been made in modernizing and diversifying the economy despite years of talking about it. Net capital outflows from Russia run at tens of billions of dollars each year at a time when its investment requirement remains huge. Russia may find an ally in China . Even Russia's status as an energy superpower is now challenged by a combination of American shale gas and EU competition measures against Gazprom. Indeed, the only metric by which Russia remains strong is its ability to generate scary headlines in the western media. These vulnerabilities give the EU plenty of options for leverage over Russia if it chooses to use them. One important focus of attention should be on political and economic reform in Ukraine itself. Stabilizing the situation, providing economic aid and encouraging free elections to choose a new government should be immediate priorities. Assistance should also be given to help Ukraine realize its goal of energy independence from Russia. Work to allow the reverse flow of Ukraine's pipelines to import gas from west to east will increase supply options until measures can be taken to raise domestic production. Reviving and completing the EU's association agreement with Ukraine will be another important element. The aim should not be to shut Russia out. Ukraine and Russia have strong ties of history and culture, a fact still reflected in the preference of most Ukrainians for close relations between the two countries. The EU should be willing to talk to Russia about its interests in the region and the creation of a common economic space provided Russia ends its military intervention, restores friendly ties with Kiev and doesn't assume a right of veto over Ukraine's future. Influence has to be earned not asserted as an attribute of Russian greatness. If Russia won't be a good neighbor, the EU should help Ukraine to move on regardless. Targeted measures aimed at the financial and personal interests of the Russian elite will also help to focus minds. We know from the Kremlin's furious reaction to the U.S. Magnitsky act that this can be an effective instrument. Travel bans and asset freezes aimed at Russian officials who supported and facilitated the invasion of Crimea should be combined with a rolling program of money laundering investigations into Russian financial assets held in western banks. Action to restrict flows of western capital, limit technology transfer and toughen visa requirements would also hurt. Perhaps the most provocative thing western governments could do would be to remind Russia of what it potentially stands to lose by undermining the principle of territorial integrity in relations between states. Russia has been anxious about its own internal cohesion since the break up of the Soviet Union. In addition to concerns about Kaliningrad and eastern Siberia, Moscow faces open revolt in the northern Caucasus. Upgrading diplomatic contacts with non-violent opposition groups from these regions is a message the Kremlin would understand. So far the measures European leaders have been prepared to discuss fall far short of what is required get Russia's attention. The suspension of trade talks that were in any case going nowhere and even cancellation of the G8 summit come under the heading of gesture diplomacy. The Obama administration has been much tougher in thinking about the kinds of sanctions that are needed. With deeper ties of energy and trade, European leaders feel they have more to lose and are reluctant to endanger what remains a fragile economic recovery. But they risk far more if nothing is done in response to a grave violation of international law. Only a direct challenge to Russia's material and geopolitical interests is likely to have an impact on Putin's calculations. Anything short of that will amount to a wasted day out in Brussels.

{"source": "### Instruction:Give me a one line summary of the story below:LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- U.S. airstrikes aimed at al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan have been \"very effective,\" with few civilian deaths as a result, CIA Director Leon Panetta said Monday in a rare public acknowledgment of the raids. CIA Director Leon Panetta speaks about the fight against al Qaeda at the Pacific Council on International Policy. Asked about criticism of the missile attacks by counterinsurgency experts, Panetta said he did not want to discuss specifics, \"but I can assure you that in terms of that particular area, it is very precise and is very limited in terms of collateral damage.\" \"Very frankly, it's the only game in town in terms of confronting or trying to disrupt the al Qaeda leadership,\" Panetta told the Pacific Council on International Policy in Los Angeles. Pakistan has complained repeatedly about what it says are airstrikes on its territory by U.S.-operated drones. The U.S. military in neighboring Afghanistan does not comment on the attacks, which typically target Islamic militants in the border region, but the United States is the only country operating in the region known to have the capability to launch missiles from remote-controlled aircraft. Panetta's predecessor, Michael Hayden, was asked about the drone attacks on Pakistani territory shortly before he left office in January, but addressed it far less directly than Panetta. \"I'm not going to talk about anything operational, and I'm not confirming or denying how any of this happens, we're not getting into that,\" he said. But he said he believed al Qaeda leaders had come to view Pakistan's tribal regions as \"neither safe nor a haven.\" Two leading former advisers on counterinsurgency warfare, David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum, wrote in The New York Times over the weekend that the strikes have killed about 14 terrorist leaders in the past three years -- but Pakistani sources say the civilian death toll could be as high as 700. While U.S. officials dispute that ratio, Kilcullen and Exum wrote, \"Every one of these dead noncombatants represents an alienated family, a new desire for revenge and more recruits for a militant movement that has grown exponentially even as drone strikes have increased.\" \"The persistence of these attacks on Pakistani territory offends people's deepest sensibilities, alienates them from their government and contributes to Pakistan's instability,\" Kilcullen and Exum said. They compared the tactics to British bombardment of the same region in the 1920s and French airstrikes on Algeria in the 1950s, arguing that the strikes were likely to remind Pakistanis of colonial rule. U.S. forces have been battling al Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan since the terrorist network's 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. Both have taken root across the rugged border in Pakistan, where Pakistani troops are waging an air and ground offensive to crush the Taliban in the Swat Valley, northwest of the capital, Islamabad. Prime Minister Yusuf Reza Gilani said Monday that the offensive will go on \"until peace is established.\" CNN's Pam Benson contributed to this report.\n### Response: ", "target": "CIA Director Leon Panetta makes rare public acknowledgment of raids .\nU.S. airstrikes \"only game in town\" to fight al Qaeda in Pakistan, he says .\nHe says strikes are very precise and collateral damage is limited .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

In the end, it may have been his love of heavy-metal music by the band Creed that saved his life. \n  \n Walter Eikrem listened to music on his mobile phone as he often does as he made his way home from school in the southern Norwegian town of Rakkestad earlier this week. The path leading from the stop where he catches the school bus to his family's farmhouse traverses a gently sloping hillside. All of a sudden, he made out something gray on the hillside. \"At first, I thought it might have been the neighbor's dogs,\" he later told TV2, Norway's largest commercial broadcaster. What he actually encountered, though, were four wolves. \n  \n \"I was afraid they would attack me,\" Walter told the Norwegian tabloid VG, describing the incident, which took place on Monday. But he didn't let his fear show. Remembering his parents' advice, Walter pulled the earphones out of his mobile phone, turned the volume all the way up and blasted heavy metal music over its miniature speakers. At the same time, he yelled as loud as he could while flailing his arms about wildly to scare off the pack of wild animals. \n  \n \"The worst thing you can do is run away because doing so just invites the wolves to chase you down,\" Walter told TV2. \"But I was so afraid that I couldn't even run away if I'd wanted to.\" \n  \n Overcoming the Wolves \n  \n The plan worked. Eikrem said he was able to drive away the wolves by playing the song \"Overcome\" by the American hard-rock band Creed. \"They didn't really get scared,\" Walter said. \"They just turned around and simply trotted away.\" \n  \n On Wednesday, the local newspaper Rakkestad Avis reported on Walter's encounter with the wolves and even gave his mother a chance to tell her side of the story. She said she had actually intended to pick her son up from school, but got delayed while shopping in Rakkestad and didn't make it on time. \n  \n \"I have a completely guilty conscience,\" she told the paper, \"because I knew there were wolves in the area. The previous evening, we saw three wolves on the edge of the forest when we were putting our horses in their stall. The horses were panicky.\" \n  \n Even so, at least she had repeated to her children often enough just how they needed to behave if they ran into any wolves. \"Just don't run away,\" she would tell them. \"You can even get a little poodle to run after you if you run away, even if it doesn't even actually want to attack you.

Frank Williams of World Vision Haiti told CNN from the Petionville section of the capital that the building in which his organization is based shook for about 35 seconds and did not weather it well. Learn more about Haiti, poorest nation in Americas . \"Portions of things on the building fell off,\" he said. \"Fortunately for us, our building remains standing and none of our staff were injured, but lots of walls are falling down. Many of our staff have tried to leave, but were unsuccessful because the walls from buildings and private residences were falling into the streets.\" In the capital, government buildings were damaged, phone service was spotty and electricity was out, except for people who had emergency generators, Williams said. The quake's impact also shook the psyches of residents, particularly when aftershocks occurred, he said. \"If there is another aftershock, there is a kind of wail as people are very frightened by it,\" Williams said. \"But most people are out in the streets and just kind of looking up.\" Joseph said he had spoken with Secretary-General Fritz Longchamps, who told him buildings collapsed on either side of him as he walked along a street in Petionville. Catholic Relief Services, international relief agency based in Baltimore, spoke briefly with their person in charge in Port-au-Prince before the line went dead. Regional Information Officer Robyn Feiser said the representative told them \"it's a total disaster.\" She quotes him as saying, \"I never felt anything like this. It was a major hit, and it was direct.\" He told Robin their building was shaking but still standing, but the building across the street from them collapsed. He described a cloud of dust everywhere, and people moving into courtyards to get away from buildings. Eighty percent of Haiti's 9 million residents live under the poverty line and more than half -- 54 percent -- live in abject poverty, according to the CIA Factbook. In 2008, four tropical storms damaged the transportation infrastructure and agricultural sector, on which two-thirds of Haitians depend, mainly as subsistence farmers. Citing that World Bank assessment, the Organization of American States said in a report on its Web site, \"Among the numerous factors explaining the extent of the loss of lives and goods are the absence of land use zoning and building guidelines, and comprehensive enforcement mechanisms.\" The OAS report added Haiti has no national building codes. Former U.S. Ambassador to Haiti Timothy M. Carney told CNN that Port-au-Prince was particularly at risk because it grew rapidly from a population of about 250,000 in the mid-1950s to more than 2 million today, all with little oversight. City planners had called for the surrounding hills to remain undeveloped in order to protect an aquifer. \"That didn't happen,\" Carney said. \"People started building up those hillsides.\" Instead of building concrete structures, they built shanties, he said. \"My fear is that they all fell down.\"\n### Response :", "target": "Haitian ambassador to U.S.: Infrastructure of island nation poor in best of times .\nRaymond Alcide Joseph calls quake \"a catastrophe of major proportions\"\nPeople are reported out in the streets, cowering in strong aftershocks .\nOAS says lack of any building standards in Haiti makes residents vulnerable .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Signs of the increasing dominance of the app came on Monday with Ford's decision to launch its newest B-Max compact at Mobile World Congress -- a phone industry gathering in Barcelona -- rather than a motor show. Read more: Powerful camera phone unveiled . Bill Ford, the U.S. auto giant's executive chairman, told CNN his company chose the event to debut its tech-filled car as a statement of its intention to work with app developers in shaping the vehicles of the future. The B-Max is the first car in Europe to feature SYNC, a voice-recognition system developed by Ford and already available in some U.S. cars. The system links audio, phone and GPS systems and will also call emergency services in the event of a crash. The increasing dependence of vehicles on computers has raised concerns that manufacturers are trading technology for safety, exposing drivers to hazardous distractions and malicious hackers. But Ford, the great grandson of Henry Ford, insisted SYNC would \"allow drivers to keep their eyes on the road and their hands on the steering wheel,\" and said his company was working with app makers to further improve security. \"Today, often, drivers are looking down and we know that they're playing with their cell phone and texting and we want to stop all that,\" he told CNN. \"We want them to be looking at the road with their hands on the wheel, and our tech is allowing them to do that, knowing they also want to be connected.\" Ford said his firm's current crop of hi-tech cars were capable of utilizing offboard \"cloud computing\" to expand their abilities, performing tasks like directing drivers to the nearest coffee shops, checking their health and keeping tabs on their daily diary. He acknowledged this raised the prospect of potential breaches that could put valuable personal data in the hands of criminals but said the technology was currently being rolled out on an \"opt-in, opt-out\" basis. The carmaker said the B-Max would eventually run its AppLink system, which will add control of smartphone apps to voice-operated commands. Among currently available apps are programs that read out Twitter updates and pick and choose radio stations. More functions will follow as it partners with app developers, the company said in a statement. \"Ford aims to deliver voice-control compatibility with apps for a wide range of services, and is now actively seeking to partner with app developers on future opportunities,\" it said in a statement. Ford hopes the B-Max, which goes on sale in Europe later this year, will help expand its current 4 million U.S. SYNC users to 13 million worldwide by 2015. It says the car should appeal to drivers previously priced out of the hi-tech market. \"The all-new B-MAX is going to be a game-changer in the European compact family vehicle segment. No other vehicle in its class offers such an attractive combination of style, versatility and technology,\" Ford Europe's chairman and CEO Stephen Odell said in a statement. \"We think it will be among the most technologically advanced small cars you can buy at any price.\" Barry Neild contributed to this story from London.\n### Response: ", "target": "Ford chooses to launch compact car at mobile phone event rather than a motor show .\nB-Max features Ford's latest voice-activated technology .\nFord says it wants to work with app developers in shaping its future vehicles .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What's the main idea?(CNN) -- Will Michael Jackson stop the world? Fans have set up impromptu shrines to Michael Jackson, including this one at his family's house. Thousands are expected to swamp Los Angeles, California, to mourn him Tuesday at the Staples Center, and the accompanying media crush will be enormous. The tribute to the King of Pop at Harlem's Apollo Theater earlier this week drew coverage from all over the world, along with a public turnout in the thousands. Given the feverish interest in all things Jackson, the Los Angeles memorial could be one of the most-viewed events of all time. \"This will obviously be a huge media event, and with Web streams of the funeral, it may be impossible to say for sure how many people watched once all is said and done, because there's still no comprehensive way to measure Web viewing,\" said Toni Fitzgerald, of Media Life, in an e-mail interview. A handful of events have earned the kind of worldwide coverage to put the world on pause, if only for a moment. The 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy \"had the nation locked in a trance for two or three days,\" recalled TV critic Ed Bark of UncleBarky.com. The world audience for the Apollo 11 moon landing has been estimated in the hundreds of millions. The BBC estimated 2.5 billion people watched the 1997 funeral of Princess Diana.   Watch Jermaine Jackson talk about his brother's legacy \u00bb . The numbers are easily exaggerated -- nobody knows how many people are watching in groups or in public places -- and the Web has complicated matters further. But in a multichannel, satellite TV, computer-and-cell phone world, the Jackson memorial could have an audience in the hundreds of millions. It was first believed the event would take place at Jackson's Neverland Ranch. But the family announced Thursday that it will hold a private ceremony Tuesday, and then a massive public memorial service at the Staples Center. Fans had until 6 p.m. Saturday to register for free tickets to the memorial service. Organizers used a computer to choose 8,750 names from 1.6 million who registered since Friday.   Watch a tour of Neverland \u00bb . \"You have to go back to the Beatles, the death of John Lennon perhaps, and the death of Elvis Presley to find a comparable figure in, not just pop music, but pop culture,\" said Entertainment Weekly critic-at-large Ken Tucker. (EW, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) \"And Jackson so self-consciously turned himself into not just an American pop icon but a global pop icon. I think this does have worldwide implications and interest.\"  See how interest in Jackson's music has skyrocketed \u00bb . The circumstances of Jackson's death have led to  comparisons with Presley's in 1977, but in terms of coverage, the two can't compare. The news wasn't even the top story on CBS' \"Evening News,\" Bark recalled, and there certainly wasn't wall-to-wall nationwide live coverage of his funeral. A public viewing drew about 30,000 fans; the funeral, two days after his death, was held in Graceland's living room. But Bark said there are parallels, at least in terms of coverage, with the Kennedy assassination. \"These days it's so much harder to get a bulk audience on any given venue the way the [broadcast networks] did back then, but still the enormity [of the event] -- it's the syndicated tabloid shows ... and TMZ and all the cable networks devoting lots of attention to it, [and] the broadcast networks can't seem to do enough specials in prime time,\" said Bark. \"I do think it's comparative but in a very different way.\" Officially, the sorts of events that have attracted the largest mass audiences have been scheduled entertainment or sports programs. Sixty percent of America watched the 1983 \"M*A*S*H\" finale; more than half watched the 1980 \"Who Shot J.R.\" episode of \"Dallas\" and the 1977 \"Roots\" conclusion. The Beatles' first appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" in 1964 drew about 45 percent of the country. The Super Bowl is routinely the year's most watched program, with audiences north of 80 million -- about 40 percent of U.S. television households. Although interest in Jackson has been high, the number of viewing choices (and, perhaps, the traditional decline in summer viewing) has kept the ratings for individual Jackson-oriented shows down. \"Jackson's death came up in just about every conversation I had from Thursday to Sunday, and yet only 5 million people tuned in to some of those broadcast specials,\" Media Life magazine's Fitzgerald observed. Still, the public memorial service might be different. \"I expect you'll see very big tune-ins on the cable news networks and on BET, if they cover it; they had huge numbers for their BET Awards focused on Jackson over the weekend,\" Fitzgerald said.

Aretha Franklin, an 18-time Grammy Award winner who Rolling Stone proclaimed the greatest female singer of all time, told CNN in an e-mail Saturday that she is interested in joining the show as a judge. Franklin, 70, who wowed the Essence Music Festival crowd last week in New Orleans and is now performing in Las Vegas, says she has long been a fan of the show. Now instead of watching it with the rest of America, she's ready to play a vital role in choosing the next \"American Idol.\" And as the Queen of Soul would do, she's already thinking about bringing along a sidekick: songstress Patti LaBelle. Fox declined to comment on Franklin on Saturday night. The addition of Franklin could help Fox stop the ratings slide of \"Idol,\" which saw it lose its spot as the top show of the year to NBC's \"Sunday Night Football.\" The addition of similar singing contests to primetime television has increased the competition for viewers.

World number four Murray powered past Argentina's Juan Monaco 6-4 6-1 in 85 minutes at the Qi Zhong center to reach his second straight final at a Masters 1000 event. Murray broke Monaco's serve early in the first set to open up a two game lead, but the South American refused to lie down, and when Murray double-faulted to squander his service game in the ninth game, it looked as though the Scot might drop his first set of the tournament.

And it wasn't until the 11th game that the Swiss was finally able to break the Serb's serve. Federer served out the first set and rammed home his advantage with an early break in the second, which was quickly followed by another. Djokovic claimed one of the breaks back but couldn't stop Federer reaching his fourth final of the season. Sunday's final is a repeat of the previous Masters event in Toronto in August. Murray won that encounter and currently holds a 7-5 career lead over the 16-time grand slam champion.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?London (CNN) -- Lego might not seem like the sort of thing to make your blood boil. The venerable toy is one of the most popular playthings of all time. People of all ages love it. And if previous years are anything to go by, Christmas stockings will soon be bulging with the stuff. But the irony is that because people feel such visceral affection for the toy, they tend to fly into a rage when they believe its standards are slipping. In fact, I'm getting a bit hot under the collar myself. The latest furore concerns Lego's \"franchise\" sets, which depict scenes from movies like \"Star Wars,\" \"Lord Of the Rings,\" and \"Marvel.\" Principled Lego enthusiasts have been arguing that they undermine the whole point of the toy, as they encourage children to construct showpiece models from instruction booklets rather than building something from their own imaginations. \"Lego taught me the art of creative destruction -- the need to break something in order to make something better,\" wrote the blogger Chris Swan. \"Lego for me was always about creativity, remaking and improving on existing designs. Those things don't happen with the sets that are designed to build a model of a single thing. \"Good old generic Lego, with endless possibilities on offer, hasn't gone away, it's just been drowned in a sea of marketing for other brands.\" Lego spokesman Roar Rude Trangbaek contested these claims. \"The bricks will probably still end up in big boxes in homes and that will act as a pool for creativity,\" he said. But many believe that the complex pieces contained in franchise sets make it very difficult for children to pursue their own designs (Lego now manufactures no less than 3,000 individual pieces). This is not the only time that Lego has found itself embroiled in controversy. In 2011, when it released \"Lego Friends,\" a range aimed at girls that included beauty parlors, cupcake bakeries and great quantities of the color pink, it was accused of crude gender stereotyping. As one seven-year-old girl wrote in a viral letter, \"all the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and they had no jobs, but the boys went on adventures, worked, saved people, and had jobs, even swam with sharks.\" (Lego's ham-fisted attempt to address these concerns, a new set called \"Research Institute\" that featured female scientists, sold out within days.) For any discerning adult, all this makes you want to weep. Whatever happened to the idea of buying big bags of Lego for your children and letting their imaginations do the rest? It all seems a long way from the guiding principle of Lego's founder, the Danish toymaker Ole Kirk Christiansen, that \"Der bedster er ikke for godt\" -- \"only the best is worthy.\" And it supports the general impression that the classic toys of previous decades are being replaced by overly commercialized, sexualized, dumbed-down bits of tat. Let's skip Sindy and Barbie and take, for instance, Playmobil. Its new City Life range, which is aimed squarely at girls, includes scenes like \"Shopping Center,\" \"Beauty Salon,\" and \"Clothing Boutique,\" all awash with sickly pink. (Because that's what girls are supposed to be into, right?) Boys, however, are presented with the \"Top Agents\" range, which includes a video camera that can be attached to a remote-control car so that kids can spy remotely on people (let's not mention the ethical tension between privacy and surveillance). This bears scant resemblance to the traditional Playmobil -- those innocent little figures with the inverted crescent smile, those skinny horses to clip them on -- which fired the imaginations of generations of children over the last few decades. Now, we all understand that toy manufacturers are not charities. They are in it for the money, and good for them. But play is a vitally important part of a child's development, and toy manufactures are uniquely placed to influence their lives -- for the better or for the worse. Why do we stand back while they ride roughshod over our kids' moral and spiritual well-being in the pursuit of maximum profit? Obviously, creating multiple differentials and marketing towards them is good for business. The more the consumer -- that is, the child -- can be sold the idea that this particular product is essential for a lifestyle aspiration, the more the dollars will come rolling in. It makes for a depressing indictment of society's view of childhood. As Christmas approaches, millions of harassed adults will stream into toy stores all over the world in search of that special something that will make their little one's eyes light up. In the vast majority of those stores, the toys will be divided by gender. Boys' toys will be largely action-based, while girls' toys will be centered around dolls, homemaking and the attempt to conform to a specific idea of beauty, all decked out in pink and tied with a bow. The gifts will be selected, wrapped and presented. There will follow two days of mayhem. The girls will instantly be wearing tacky princess dresses; the boys will be armed to the teeth and roaring. Toys that appear impressive but are actually impossible to play with will be littered in the corners of rooms. Electronic noises will blare unneeded from every corner, and children will enter a vegetative state as they sit for hour upon hour in the dystopian glow of various screens. Now, I'm not a Christian. But it strikes me that Christmas should be more than just an orgy of consumerism. This Yuletide, therefore, perhaps we should consider these questions seriously. What sort of adults will today's children become? What sort of world will they create? And what are their toys actually doing to them?\n### Response : ", "target": "Christmas stockings will be bulging with Lego, especially sets depicting movie scenes .\nLego enthusiasts argue they undermine point of toy, to stimulate imaginations .\nPlay is vitally important part of a child's development, says Jake Wallis Simons .\nAspirational toys make for depressing indictment of society's view of childhood, he argues .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Satellite data has shown that Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela receives more lightning flashes than anywhere else in the world. \n  \n Previously, the Congo Basin in Africa was identified as the lightning capital of the world, with a peak of 160 flashes per square kilometre each year. Researchers from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo and Nasa's Marshall Space Flight Center wanted to create an updated lightning map.

The LIS captures the time of a lightning flash, the location and its energy, even in daylight. They ranked lightning hotspots across the world by the amount of lightning flashes, using data spreading 16 years. \n  \n The results, published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, showed Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela has the most lightning flashes on Earth. On average, it had 233 lightning flashes per square kilometre per year. \n  \n \"Lake Maracaibo has a unique geography and climatology that is ideal for the development of thunderstorms,\" said Dennis Buechler, researcher working on the study. Storms regularly form over the lake at night, as mountain breezes converge over the warm, moist air above the water. The conditions contribute to deep convection currents of air, which results in an average of 297 night-time thunderstorms each year. \n  \n The number two hotspot is near the city of Kabare in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The north west ridges of the Himalayas in Pakistan was the highest-ranked lightning hotspot in Asia. The Everglades in Florida was the top area in the US. \n  \n Africa has six of the world's top 10 lightning hotspots; the most of all continents. Most of these were close to Lake Victoria and other lakes along the East African Rift Valley. These lakes have a similar geography to Lake Maracaibo, explaining why they receive so many lightning flashes. \n  \n Richard Blakeslee, a researcher working on the study, said: \"We can now observe lightning flash rate density in very fine detail on a global scale.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?U.S. and coalition warplanes pounded ISIS positions in eastern Syria on Wednesday, targeting what a Pentagon official described as mobile oil refineries being used by the so-called Islamic State terror group to help finance its operations. The latest round of airstrikes were aimed at cutting off money flowing to ISIS, which makes up to $2 million a day from oil produced by the mobile refineries, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, told CNN. Fighter jets from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates flew alongside U.S. aircraft during the operation, hitting 12 locations, Kirby said. While the U.S. military was still assessing the outcome of the attacks, Kirby said initial indications suggest the strikes were successful. \"We are very confident we hit what we were aiming at, and we caused the damage we wanted,\" he said. The airstrikes came just hours after U.S. President Barack Obama called for united action to confront ISIS, also referred to as ISIL. \"It is no exaggeration to say that humanity's future depends on us uniting against those who would divide us along fault lines of tribe or sect; race or religion,\" Obama said in an address before the U.N. General Assembly. \"This is not simply a matter of words. Collectively, we must take concrete steps to address the danger posed by religiously motivated fanatics, and the trends that fuel their recruitment.\" China, Russia raise questions . Obama's call for action comes as questions were raised over his decision to bomb terror groups in Syria without approval from the U.N. Security Council. Even as the Security Council adopted a resolution drawn up by the United States addressing the growing threat posed by foreign fighters, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the world must act -- but only with U.N. approval. Airstrikes get Bill Clinton's approval . Russia's foreign minister warned \"against any attempt to narrow down the problem\" to select groups, urging the world not to have \"double standards in dividing terrorists into good terrorists and bad terrorists.\" China and Russia, both permanent members of the Security Council, have blocked a number of attempts to force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down as a way to bring about an end to the civil war that has since seen the rise of ISIS and other terror groups. Still, while the U.S.-led military action in Syria hasn't been widely embraced, those involved in the international coalition in Iraq is growing. The Dutch foreign ministry announced Wednesday that its military will contribute six F-16 fighter jets and 250 troops to carry out airstrikes and train Iraqi and Kurdish forces. Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said his country's parliament will weigh a request for six of its fighter jets to take part in the bombing campaign. Similarly, British Prime Minister David Cameron said he's recalling Parliament Friday \"to secure approval for the United Kingdom to participate in the Iraq air campaign. \"The U.N. Security Council has now received a clear request from the Iraqi government to support it in its military action against ISIL,\" Cameron said from U.N. headquarters in New York. \"... So it is right that Britain should move to a new phase of action.\" More airstrikes . The latest airstrikes against the refineries followed another round carried out overnight Tuesday into Wednesday against five more targets: four in Iraq and one in Syria, according to U.S. Central Command. In Syria, U.S. and coalition fighter jets struck an ISIS staging area near the Iraqi border, northwest of al Qaim, damaging eight ISIS vehicles. In Iraq, two airstrikes west of Baghdad destroyed two ISIS armed vehicles and a weapons cache. Two airstrikes southeast of the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil destroyed ISIS fighting positions. Conceding that airstrikes so far haven't flushed out ISIS in Iraq, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that American air power may nonetheless have prevented the fall of Baghdad and Irbil to the militants. \"What we've done is we've stopped the onslaught,\" he told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. The airstrikes in Syria have also targeted ISIS' proclaimed capital of Raqqa. Share your view on the airstrikes . Activist: ISIS fighters keep low profile . An activist from Raqqa, who uses the pseudonym Maher al-Ahmad, told CNN he'd gone back to the town after the airstrikes. \"It's the first time I didn't see ISIS in the streets, that I was able to walk around, because I am wanted by them,\" said al-Ahmad, who moves between Raqqa and Turkey's Gaziantep province. He said people who were there during the strikes described them as feeling like earthquakes. Some 20 to 25 vehicles filled with ISIS fighters, including people he believes were senior leadership because of the level of security around them, left the city within hours of the attacks, the activist said. After keeping a low profile during the day, the ISIS fighters were out in the streets again by Tuesday evening but in lower numbers than usual, he said. ISIS fighters began moving into the homes of civilians in the past two to three weeks, al-Ahmad said, raising fears that the civilians may be used as human shields or fall victim to future airstrikes. Hassan al-Halabi, an activist from Aleppo, voiced similar fears, saying residents there have two main concerns about upcoming strikes in Syria. \"The first is that they are afraid of having civilian casualties because ISIS members and fighters are among civilians,\" al-Halabi said. \"And the second concern is that what will happen after that? Who will replace ISIS, especially that the regime is ready to take control of ISIS' areas?\"\n### Response: ", "target": "British Parliament -- like Belgium's -- will weigh request to participate in Iraq airstrikes .\nAirstrikes have resumed in eastern Syria, a U.S. official tells CNN .\nPresident Barack Obama urges ISIS fighters to \"leave the battlefield while they can\"\nU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry: U.S. airstrikes have \"stopped the onslaught\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

By all indications, it seems that the popular career networking site has run afoul of the country's infamous Great Firewall. According to LinkedIn's Hani Durzy, the company is aware of a blockage in China and is \"currently in the process of investigating the situation further.\" The shutdown follows days of calls for a \"Jasmine Revolution\" in China, on the model of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. Access to Twitter and Facebook has been blocked throughout China for some time; Chinese internet users seeking to use Twitter have been forced to access the site through difficult-to-use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). However, Chinese dissidents have another way of accessing Twitter... LinkedIn. Use of LinkedIn, which is fully integrated with Twitter, was by far the easiest way to access Twitter in China. Messages can be easily read and posted through Twitter via LinkedIn. One Chinese Twitter user who accesses both Twitter and LinkedIn through a proxy posted photos to Twitpic that seem to confirm a Chinese LinkedIn outage. Adding credence to the LinkedIn-shutdown-to-block-Twitter strategy is the news that the Chinese government has started censoring the name of U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman from search results on the wildly popular homegrown Twitter/Tumblr clones Sina Weibo/QQ Weibo. Weibo means \"microblog\" in Chinese. Huntsman faces widespread charges in China of support for the Jasmine Revolution after a citizen journalist spotted him watching a pro-democracy protest from within a crowd this past Sunday. Like any good American abroad, Huntsman was standing outside a McDonald's. According to The Wall Street Journal, Chinese dissidents have been disseminating calls to protest and organizing events via LinkedIn. Reuters notes that the LinkedIn outagecould hurt the firm's chances at an IPO: . \"If the disruption for LinkedIn is permanent in China, it could hurt the company's prospects at an IPO as a ban would exclude the company from the world's largest Internet market--about 450 million users and growing.\" \"It certainly would be a negative in terms of the company's future growth and profitability,\" said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida. \"This is something where investors would take it into account and be willing to pay a little lower price per share.\" Luckily for LinkedIn, China's Internet censors are notoriously fickle: Sites blip on and off the Great Firewall frequently, with no prior warning.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?Rabun County, Georgia (CNN) -- One look at the landscape and you know why people come here -- running white water, along a portion of the Appalachian Trail. This is Rabun County, Georgia. It was the residents' own best-kept secret until the world discovered it by way of a 1972 movie. The movie, \"Deliverance,\" made tourist dollars flow into the area, but there was one memorable, horrifying male rape scene that lasted a little more than four minutes, but has lasted 40 years inside the hearts and minds of the people who live here. Locals say the film painted the county's residents as deviant, uneducated mountain folk. \"We were portrayed as ignorant, backward, scary, deviant, redneck hillbillies,\" said Rabun County Commissioner Stanley \"Butch\" Darnell. \"That stuck with us through all these years and in fact that was probably furthest from the truth. These people up here are a very caring, lovely people.\" This weekend, the film's 40th anniversary will be celebrated at the Chattooga River Festival. A re-release of the iconic film on Blu-ray by Warner Home Video will play at the local drive-in on Saturday. The film tells the story of four big-city guys who take a drive up to northern Georgia to canoe the white water of the Chattooga River that separates Georgia from South Carolina. It's remembered for the dueling banjo scene at the beginning of the film, where one man, played by Ronnie Cox, plays a duet with a local teen, who is portrayed as inbred and mentally challenged. \"Dueling banjos, of course, was iconic, but then there's the rape scene, too,\" Cox said. \"And for a lot of people it became a tough pill to swallow. \"Some people, I think they missed the artistic essence of it (the film), the value of it.\" But it's the rape scene that seems to dominate any conversation about the film. \"You were in the middle of the Bible Belt, the biggest thing we had gong back then is we had square dancing at the Mountain City Playhouse,\" said Darnell, the county commissioner. But many people, like Billy Redden, say the local folks should put this behind them. The 40th anniversary means a lot to him. He's 56 now, but 40 years ago, he was a student who was asked to play the \"Banjo boy\" after the film's producers found him on a visit to his high school. \"I don't think it should bother them. I think they just need to start realizing that it's just a movie. It's not like it's real,\" said Redden, who still lives in Rabun County. But despite any negative stereotypes, the Rabun County Convention and Visitor's Bureau says more than a quarter-million people flock to the area each year to shoot the same rapids they saw come to life on the big screen. The South: Not all Bubbas and banjos . \"It essentially started the white-water rafting industry in the Southeast, \" said Larry Mashburn, who owns Southeastern Expeditions, a rafting company. County officials say tourism brings in $42 million a year in revenue, which makes for a huge surplus for a county whose operating budget is about $17 million. These days, the county has an 80% high school graduation rate, and its average home price is more than $300,000. \"It's allowed us to do things with our education system, with all these different services that we offer, we could not have offered,\" Darnell said. The area has become a playground for high-end homeowners with lakefront property in the multimillion-dollar range on places like Lake Burton, which has 62 miles of shoreline. \"Once people come to Rabun County, they don't want to leave,\" said Debra Butler, a real estate agent. \"This is a lifestyle that you have here. It's a way of life. 'Deliverance' depicts a backwoods, inbred kind of community. That is not Rabun County.\" Indeed, downtown shops and art galleries convey an image far from anything portrayed in the 1972 film. Jeanne Kronsoble's Main Street Gallery in Clayton shows off a wide range of contemporary folk artists, many self-taught. She's been open for 28 years. \"I became interested in contemporary folk art because of the things I'd seen up here,\" she said. \"When people build houses and they come here, they need art on their walls.\" Most believe \"Deliverance\" got it all started. But despite this prosperity, the 40-year pain has managed to hang on, because so many people saw a fictional film. \"There are lots of people in Rabun County that would be just as happy if they never heard the word, 'Deliverance' again,\" Darnell said.\n### Response :", "target": "The 1972 movie \"Deliverance\" was shot in Rabun County, Georgia .\nThe film spurred hard-to-shake stereotypes of \"ignorant\" and \"deviant\" mountain dwellers .\n\"Deliverance\" also generated huge tourism dollars for the northwest Georgia county .\nReal estate agent: \"Once people come to Rabun County, they don't want to leave\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The capital city's attorney general, Irvin Nathan, said in a letter to NBC there would be no charges, but added that it was \"a very close decision.\" Nathan also said \"there is no doubt of the gravity of the illegal conduct in this matter, especially in a city and a nation that have been plagued by carnage from gun violence.\" The letter also confirmed the 30-round magazine displayed by show host David Gregory on December 23 was empty. At the time, Gregory was interviewing Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association, a strong opponent of new gun control proposals. Nathan said the network used the magazine with the \"purpose of informing an ongoing public debate about firearms policy\" not long after the school shooting massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. Even an empty magazine violates city law. Conviction carries a possible sentence of up to a year in jail as well as a possible fine of up to $1,000. A police spokeswoman said that NBC asked before the program whether it would be legal to show a high capacity magazine on air and was told no. An official with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives told CNN he consulted with city police after receiving a similar request from NBC and was told an empty magazine would not be a problem. The official passed the information to NBC, but later learned there was a \"miscommunication\" with police and that showing an empty magazine would, indeed, violate the law. The official said he did not give NBC permission to use a magazine. In his letter, Nathan referred to \"feeble and unsatisfactory efforts\" made by NBC to find out what it could legally do. \"Although there appears to have been some misinformation provided initially, NBC was clearly and timely advised by a (Metropolitan Police Department) employee that its plans to exhibit on the broadcast a high capacity magazine would violate D.C. law, and there was no contrary advice from any federal official,\" Nathan said.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?(CNN) -- American golfer Webb Simpson expects a close battle with world No. 1 Luke Donald this week as both seek to top the PGA Tour's end-of-season money list for the first time. Both will line up in Florida for the final event of the U.S. circuit's Fall Series, with $846,000 on offer for the winner from a total prize purse of $4.7 million. Donald had been in pole position in his bid to become the first golfer to top both the U.S. and European money lists in the same season, but Simpson went $363,029 clear in the PGA standings despite suffering a playoff defeat to fellow American Ben Crane at the McGladrey Classic on Sunday. Englishman Donald, who went to a friend's wedding instead, will now need to finish second or higher at the Children's Miracle Network Classic at Disney World starting on Thursday to usurp Simpson. Simpson has won $6.2 million so far from 25 events, while Donald is on almost $5.84 million from 18. The 26-year-old Simpson is seeking to cap an incredible breakthrough year in which he won his first title at Wyndham Championship in his home state of North Carolina in August, then triumphed in the second event of the FedEx Cup playoffs and narrowly missed out on the $10 million jackpot when he faded to 22nd at the Tour Championship. \"I think coming in, finishing second is going to make it a lot harder for Luke,\" world No. 12 Simpson told the PGA Tour's official website. \"But I'm sure he's going to play well. He's played well most every week this year. I still wouldn't be surprised if I have a little work to do next week. \"It would be nice to run away with it, but it wouldn't surprise me if it's going to be pretty close. Winning would take care of a lot, I think.\" Crane said his form over Sunday's final round was \"as good as I can play\" after claiming his fourth title. The new world No. 50 carded eight birdies in the final 11 holes to finish on 15 under par, before Simpson bogeyed at the second additional hole to hand Crane victory. \"Is that right?\" Crane said when he heard the statistics from his impressive round. \"What the heck? Wow. That's as good as I can play. \"I just said, 'Well, if I'm going to have a chance, I'm going to have to birdie two of the last three holes.' \"Newsflash: If you don't birdie the first one and you're dormie with two holes to play and you've got to make two birdies, it gets harder. I read it perfectly and the ball went right in the middle and I was just thrilled.\" Despite the win, his first since the Farmers Insurance Open in January 2010, Crane had little time to celebrate, with his wife Heather due to give birth to their third child on Monday. \"I told my wife, 'I don't even know if I should -- what am I doing here? You're about to go into labor ... Should I even be playing this week?' \" he said . \"I was driving, bringing the car down after the playoff was over, and someone said, 'Well, you've got to name the baby -- the baby's middle name has got to be McGladrey or Frederica ...

Threats were made on social networking sites and via text messages. The suspects, clockwise from top left are: Lernio Colin, Angel Cruz, Peter MacDonald and Christopher Harter. A murder plot was hatched and, police say, in the early hours of last Saturday morning, a Florida man was gunned down in his car. But the suspects apparently killed  the wrong man. Now four men are in custody, and will face charges of first degree premeditated murder and two counts of attempted murder. The four are Angel Cruz, 23; his brother from Oregon, Christopher Harter, 29; Peter MacDonald, 18; and Lernio Colin, 20. They have all appeared before a judge in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. They have not entered pleas and are being held without bond, according to state prosecutors. Detectives are executing search warrants today, and much about the case is still not known. \"The victim was with two other males, in the vehicle,\" said Mike Jachles of the Broward Sheriff's Office. \"One of those men was the intended target,\" Jachles told CNN. Witnesses said multiple shots were fired, according to police. Henry Mancilla, 24 was sitting in the driver's seat of a gold Mitsubishi Galant at an intersection in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, near Fort Lauderdale. \"They were exiting the vehicle when shots were fired, striking Mancilla,\" said Jachles. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Mancilla was with two other men in their early 20s, Tony Santana and Nick Pappas. One of them was the intended victim, but police are not saying who. \"The four men acted in unison in planning and executing this murder. Mancilla was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and he ended up the victim,\" said Mike Jachles. The three victims said they had been \"jumped\" earlier in the evening by the same four men and fled the scene in a red Chevy Impala, according to a sheriff's detective affidavit released Monday afternoon. Later, a blue Chevy Silverado pickup truck belonging to the defendant Cruz drove up to the three men, according to the affidavit. The victims say they armed themselves with a baseball bat and a walking cane, when the truck turned around and drove towards them. That's when the shots were fired. Christopher Harter told police he was in the vehicle at the scene, but said he left the vehicle and then heard four or five gunshots, according to the affidavit. Harter also told police he saw his brother, Angel Cruz, in possession of a semi-automatic pistol three weeks prior to the incident. \"It could have been a case of mistaken identity, but our investigation will determine that,\" Jachles told CNN. Threats were posted on social networking sites and sent via cellular text messages by the suspects to the intended victim, said police. Police said they have not subpoenaed those records and are not releasing the names of those Internet sites.

{"source": "### Instruction :What's the text mainly about?\n### Input:(CNN) -- Leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council arrived in Saudi Arabia Monday for a meeting to discuss transforming their six nations into a union similar to the European Union. The idea of integrating the GCC nations into one entity -- and replacing what exists now as simply a cooperative -- was first floated by Saudi Arabia in December. Monday's meeting in Riyadh will lay out the timetable for it. The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. \"The threats of all kinds require the hard works of the GCC countries to shift from a current formula of cooperation to a union formula acceptable to the six countries,\" Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal said last month. He didn't specify what threats he was referring to. But some analysts have said the GCC move could be an effort to counter the growing influence of Shiite Iran. The GCC was formed in 1981, soon after Iran instituted a Shiite theocracy and went to war with primarily Sunni Iraq. Iran and Iraq have enjoyed closer ties in recent years, especially as Iraq's Shia Muslim majority has solidified its power in the absence of former leader Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Muslim. After U.S. forces pulled out of Iraq last year, Tehran expanded military and security cooperation with Baghdad. Also, GCC member Bahrain blames Iran for fueling the anti-government unrest that continues to roil the country. Tehran has denied involvement. Bahrain is a predominantly Shiite country, ruled by a Sunni royal family. Last year, at the height of the protests, Bahrain called in troops from member nations Saudi Arabia and the UAE and cracked down. Iran is also engaged in a longtime dispute with the UAE over three Persian Gulf islands; Abu Mousa, and Greater and Lesser Tunb. The UAE says Iran has illegally occupied the islands. Iran views them as part of its territory. \"I think President (Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad, when he visited the Abu Mousa island a couple weeks ago, in a way he highlighted the need for the union to counter the adventurism of the Iranian government,\" said GCC Assistant Secretary General Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg. In this climate comes the GCC move to form a union. \"Such strategic vision would include common approaches to defense, security, political and economic long-term interests,\" Aluwaisheg said in an opinion piece Sunday in the Saudi English-language daily, Arab News. Already, Al Wefaq, Bahrain's main Shiite opposition party, has demanded that the Bahraini government put the idea to a popular vote before it agrees. \"The people of the states of the European Union voted on the union decision before the union was announced. The people of the Gulf should also have their say,\" said Al-Wefaq Secretary General Shaikh Ali Salman. Aluwaisheg disagrees. \"The GCC is much more popular among the people than the EU (is) among the people of Europe. It's extremely popular,\" he said. \"No need to take a vote because it's really a done deal. If anything, the GCC has always been criticized for being too slow.\"\n### Response: ", "target": "NEW: Leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council arrive in Saudi Arabia .\nA union is needed to \"counter the adventurism\" of Iran, an official says .\n\"Threats of all kinds\" require such a union, the Saudi foreign minister says .\nBahrain blames Iran for the anti-government protests .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Fighting dogs may die in the ring or at the hands of their owners. If they are confiscated in a bust, they are almost always euthanized, experts say. Of the 1.4 million dogs euthanized at shelters last year, roughly half were pit bull types, Merritt Clifton says. Thursday is the deadline for owners to retrieve any of the 50 remaining pit bulls seized in April from the Virginia property of suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, who is accused of using them in vicious dogfights. A federal judge is expected to issue a court order to euthanize the animals. Officials and animal rights advocates agree that the dogs must lose this last battle for their lives because of their brutal training and risks to people and other animals. \"They're just not in any situation where they can be adopted,\" said Dr. Lauren Adams, a veterinarian with Emory Animal Hospital in Decatur, Georgia. \"They can snap at any point.\" Of the 1.4 million dogs euthanized at shelters last year, roughly half were pit bull types, according to the latest data from Merritt Clifton, editor of Animal People. The pit bull is not a breed but a type that includes American Pit Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers, Staffordshire Bull Terriers, and pit bull mixes, according to the Pit Bull Rescue Central Web site. Clifton and other experts estimate anywhere from 25 to 50 percent of pit bulls euthanized at shelters were fighting dogs. \"Those dogs have been bred for aggression. You can breed for certain physical traits, but you can also breed for behavioral characteristics,\" said Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States. Dogs that lose the fights often are abandoned at shelters, but not all of them make it that far. Owners sometimes kill the dogs that don't win. Court documents from the Vick case say \"the losing dog was sometimes put to death by drowning, strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other method.\"  Learn about the dark world of dogfighting \u00bb . If the dogs do make it to shelters, they are usually euthanized quickly. Keeping them alive puts a burden on shelters, which can be held legally responsible if anything goes wrong, and puts the other animals at risk.  Watch why some say euthanasia is the only option for fighting dogs -- viewer discretion advised \u00bb . \"It's very difficult to deprogram that behavior once it is instilled,\" Pacelle said. \"Even if you can do it to some degree, all it takes is one lapse in the animal's behaviors to kill another animal or exhibit some other type of aggression.\" Additionally, shelters face the threat of theft. In the United States, there are an estimated 40,000 people who are considered professional dogfighters and another 100,000 amateur \"streetfighters,\" according to John Goodwin, an expert on animal fighting with HSUS. Those involved compete for prizes as high as $100,000, and confiscated pit bulls are extremely valuable. Inside the overpopulated shelters, where it's survival of the most adoptable, shelters focus their limited resources on the dogs that stand a better chance of finding a home. The stigma associated with pit bull types has victimized the \"good\" pit bulls, Pacelle said. In some shelters, as many as 60 percent of dogs are pit bull mixes. More than 90 percent of pit bulls in shelters -- fighters or not -- end up euthanized, said Clifton, who has been researching animal shelters for more than three decades. In the early 1900s, pit bulls were characterized as \"nanny dogs\" because they were used by families to baby-sit their children. \"By the end of the century, they were these horrible, aggressive, fighting dog machines, and that's very unfortunate,\" said Ed Boks, general manager of Los Angeles Animal Services in California. The secondary fighting market has contributed to over breeding of pit bulls, Clifton said. The market creates a place where people can sell dogs as disposable commodities -- like pigs or chickens -- at much lower prices than would be invested in a pet, he said. These disposable dogs are designed to fight until they can fight no more. \"It was back in the '70s, '80s and '90s when people discovered just how loving these animals are -- so loving that they would fight to the death to please their owners,\" Boks said. Considering the risk the fighting dogs pose to shelters, potential owners and other animals, \"they just don't have a chance,\" Clifton said. \"You can compare it to what happens with exotic cats and people who keep tigers in their backyard. It's not the tiger's fault, but you are still on the menu. They are victims, but you do have to treat them as animals that belong in maximum security.\" E-mail to a friend .\n### Response: ", "target": "Dogs that survive the fighting pit are almost always euthanized .\n50 remaining pit bulls seized from Michael Vick's property could be euthanized .\nRoughly half of all dogs euthanized at shelters are pit bulls or pit bull mixes .\nPit bulls can be good pets if bought as puppies and raised properly .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Marines conduct recovery efforts at the crash site of U.S. Navy Capt. Michael Scott Speicher, shot down in 1991. The new details of the final hunt for U.S. Navy pilot Scott Speicher, who was lost over Iraq on the opening night of the Gulf War in January 1991, were released by the Pentagon Friday. Two sites were searched by U.S. troops who dug west of Baghdad, Iraq, in Anbar province, one at the plane crash site and another 2 kilometers away. The remains of Capt. Speicher were found at the second location. The U.S. military has long said Speicher had ejected out of his jet after it was hit by an Iraqi missile. After years of searching, it was just last month that the military got the crucial information that led them to the burial site. A Bedouin who was just 11 years old at the time of the crash came forward and connected the military with other locals who had knowledge of generally where the crash and burial locations were. The tipster did not know exactly where Speicher was buried but he knew others who had the knowledge, the military statement explained. \"He willingly provided his information during general discussion with MNF-W [Multi-National Force-West]personnel and stated he was unaware of the U.S. government's interest in this case until queried by U.S. investigators in July 2009,\" according to the statement. Bedouin are desert-dwelling nomadic Arabs. One hundred and fifty U.S. military troops were dispatched to dig for the remains at the crash site and did not find any sign of the pilot. At the second site the troops discovered skeletal fragments, according to the statement. Dental records initially identified the bones as Speicher's and, on August 2, DNA results came back positive. Speicher's remains will be taken to Jacksonville, Florida, for burial, according to a family spokeswoman. Speicher was a lieutenant commander when shot down, but because his status remained uncertain, he received promotions during the past 18 years, reaching the rank of captain.\n### Response :", "target": "U.S. Navy pilot Scott Speicher lost over Iraq opening night of Gulf War in 1991 .\nTwo sites searched by U.S. troops, west of Baghdad, Iraq, in Anbar province .\nA Bedouin, 11 at time of crash, connected military with locals who knew of crash .\nSpeicher's remains will be taken to Jacksonville, Florida, for burial .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Ann Pettway, who pleaded guilty in February to one count of kidnapping, expressed remorse in a brief statement to the federal court in Manhattan. \"I would like to apologize to the family,\" Pettway told U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel. \"I am deeply sorry for what I've done. If they don't accept it, it's understandable,\" said Pettway, adding, \"I'm here today to right my wrong and ask for forgiveness.\" According to prosecutors, the parents of the baby girl, named Carlina Renae White, had taken her to Harlem Hospital on August 4, 1987, because she had a fever. Early the following day, hospital personnel discovered the baby was gone. For 23 years Pettway raised the girl under another name and as her own child, prosecutors said. In January 2010, when the victim sought to get prenatal care during her own pregnancy, she had difficulty getting a birth certificate from Pettway, prosecutors said. The victim became suspicious and contacted the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. DNA confirmed she was Carlina White, the daughter of Carl Tyson and Joy White. Pettway turned herself in to the FBI in Bridgeport, Connecticut, shortly after the victim, now in her mid-20s, was reunited with her birth parents. Pettway, now 50, told authorities she took the baby because she had suffered two stillborn births, one just months before the abduction. The birth parents both read statements Monday during Pettway's sentencing hearing. \"I never had a chance to put my daughter on a school bus,\" said Carl Tyson, making direct eye contact with Pettway. \"What they should give you is 23 years for what you took from me.\" A teary-eyed Joy White told a packed courtroom, \"I only spent 19 days with (her daughter) from birth, and those were the most memorable days of my life.\" Both parents admit to difficulties trying to get to know their now-adult daughter. Judge Castel recommended Pettway serve her sentence in facilities in Danbury, Connecticut, or Tallahassee, Florida, where she could participate in mental health programs. In addition to 12 years in prison, Pettway was also sentenced to three years probation and ordered to pay a $100 special assessment fee.\n### Response :", "target": "A 19-day-old infant disappeared from a Manhattan hospital in 1987 .\nProsecutors say she was taken by a woman who raised the child under a different name .\nThe victim became suspicious as an adult, and DNA tests established her true identity .\nThe woman who pleaded guilty to taking the infant apologizes .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction: Can you give me the gist of this text?\n### Input:To hear prosecutors tell it, Darrien Hunt lunged at officers with a \"samurai-type sword\" before he was killed. To hear his family tell it, police shot the 22-year-old several times while he was running away. An independent autopsy proves he was shot from behind, his family's attorney said. And while there's no consensus about what happened last Wednesday morning, the Utah case is already drawing comparisons to the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Hunt's mother said she believes race played a role in her son's death. \"They killed my son because he's black,\" Susan Hunt told CNN affiliate KSL. \"No white boy with a little sword would they shoot while he's running away.\" But the Utah County Attorney's Office said there is \"currently no indication that race played any role in the confrontation between Mr. Hunt and the police officer.\" \"Police officers from the Saratoga Springs Police Department responded to a report of a suspicious individual walking around a local business with a 'samurai-type' sword,\" Chief Deputy Tim Taylor of the prosecutor's office said in a statement. \"When the officers made contact with Mr. Hunt, preliminary evidence suggests that Mr. Hunt brandished the sword and lunged toward the officers with the sword, at which time Mr. Hunt was shot.\" Hunt family attorney Randall Edwards challenged that version of events. An independent autopsy shows Hunt was shot six times from behind, Edwards told CNN. \"We are not going to release the independent autopsy results or the name of who performed it until the Utah State Medical Examiner releases its results,\" Edwards said. The claim that Hunt lunged at officers with the sword \"seems to be inaccurate,\" Edwards said, \"based on witnesses who saw him running from police officers and our independent autopsy.\" The county attorney's office said the case is under investigation. Two officers have been placed on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated, KSL said. \"Rest assured that there is more to this story,\" police said in a statement on their Facebook page. \"Many of the details cannot yet be shared due to the ongoing investigation.\" Hunt was arrested in January on several charges, including assault, child abuse and intoxication, according to county records. Edwards said that arrest had nothing to do with last week's shooting, and that Hunt had no history of interactions with the Saratoga Springs Police Department. The arrest came after a fist fight with one of Hunt's siblings, Edwards said, \"and since it was his first offense he was able to have it dropped from his record if he pleaded guilty to the charges.\" \"We don't know exactly what happened, but the fact that a black kid with an Afro was shot while walking down the street by two white officers in a city that is 96% white is concerning,\" Edwards said. \"There are serious questions as to why officers were questioning him and the use of force in this situation.\" While some have speculated that race played a role in the shooting deaths of Hunt and Brown, there's one key difference between the two cases: Brown was unarmed when he was shot, and Hunt was reportedly carrying a 3-foot sword around a Panda Express restaurant and other businesses. \"I believe that maybe my son thought, 'Maybe I'll try to get a job at Panda, maybe this sword will impress them,' \" Susan Hunt told KSL. She said that the sword was purchased at a local Asian gift shop and that it could not actually cut anything. In a statement Monday, Panda Restaurant Group spokesman Thien Ho said the Saratoga Springs location was closed at the time of the shooting. \"We do not have first-hand details of what occurred,\" Ho said. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said the case, like the Brown shooting, highlights the issue of when police can use deadly force. Officers are justified in using deadly force, she said, to defend their lives or to stop a fleeing felon whose escape would pose a serious threat to the officer or to the public. \"So when I see this fact pattern where someone may have been shot in the back, that someone must have been committing a violent crime and pose a threat to society, the public, for that officer to be justified in shooting the person,\" Hostin said. \"These cases are very case and fact-specific. But it does seem to odd to me that, if he was running away with this fake sword, that  deadly force would be appropriate.\" But there are other questions to consider, she said, including whether the sword looked fake. \"Maybe the sword looked to be a real sword,\" Hostin said. \"And was there a violent crime committed with that sword?\"\n### Response: ", "target": "Family's attorney: Autopsy shows he was shot six times from behind .\n\"Serious questions as to why officers were questioning him,\" attorney says .\nAuthorities say Darren Hunt lunged at police with a sword .\nMother: He may have taken the sword to try to get a job at Panda Express .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Given the following news article, summarize the article:(CNN) -- You may have just unwrapped your new iPad 2, but rumors are already swirling about the iPad 3. The always-fertile field of Apple rumors is once again blossoming furiously, as tech observers pore over the most minute tidbits of information to speculate on the future of the market-leading Apple tablet. While much of the chatter is just that, there are a few details to be gleaned in all the usual fervor that precedes an Apple \"iLaunch.\" It was January 2010 when Apple unveiled the \"magical\" iPad, introducing much of the general public to the concept of a tablet computer for the first time. With the massive Consumer Electronics Show set for January 10-13 and MacWorld/iWorld -- billed as \"the world's ultimate fan event\" for Apple lovers -- scheduled for January 26-28, observers are wondering whether Apple could soon roll out the third generation of the device. On Thursday morning, the conventional wisdom in the blogosphere seemed virtually sure that Apple would do so. But by Friday, many tech pundits were saying there's no way it will happen. Tomorrow? Who knows? \"We've entered a post-iPhone news cycle, when iPad rumors are surfacing with full force,\" wrote Leslie Horn for PC Magazine. \"Of course the launch date has been discussed quite a bit, as it goes with any anticipated Apple device. ... But the reality with an Apple gadget is that we'll have to wait and see.\" Other tidbits making the rounds? That a new model will be rolled out February 24, which would have been Steve Jobs' birthday, or in March, the same month the iPad 2 was introduced. Richard Shim, an analyst at research firm DisplaySearch, told CNET that a January release date might be wishful thinking. January is \"a little suspect,\" Shim told the blog. \"When they make them available they want to have as many as possible. And my sense is that they will wait rather than make them immediately available.\" But from folks who monitor the supply chain of Apple components in Asia and other analysts, a few plausible details have emerged: . Faster processor. Several reports have suggested that the new iPads will have a new, faster processor that will offer quicker browsing, gaming and other activity. Apple recently started using a plant in Austin, Texas, to manufacture computer chips, according to a Reuters report and other sources. Analysts have speculated that facility, owned by Samsung, could be the source of the new processors. Sharper screen. It's also a relatively safe bet to expect a higher-resolution screen, an upgrade that's been a staple in most new permutations of Apple's mobile products. Reports of a much stronger battery have also surfaced in multiple places and seem to have some merit. Voice control. One can't help wonder whether Apple will add Siri, the iPhone 4S's voice-control \"virtual assistant,\" to the new iPad as well. A cheaper iPad. Also possible is that Apple will attempt to address, in some way, the recent success of the smaller, simpler Kindle Fire tablet from Amazon, which costs $300 less than the entry-level iPad 2. No single tablet computer from Apple's competitors had gained much traction until Amazon rolled out the Fire this holiday season. The company says it sold more than 4 million Kindles in December, and most of those are believed to be Kindle Fires. How Apple may address that competition has prognosticators split. Taiwan-based DigiTimes, which sparked much of Thursday's speculation with a report that the new iPad will be unveiled in January, also reported that the company will roll out two new tablets and that the iPad 2 would get a price cut to let it compete more directly with the Fire. (It should be noted that DigiTimes has a somewhat spotty track record, doing pretty well with reports out of its native Taiwan but missing the mark more often on other news). The same site quoted unnamed sources just two weeks ago saying that Apple would be unveiling a 7-inch tablet to match the Fire, a departure that would seem unlikely unless it was in the works well before Amazon's new gadget was announced. Shim attempted to throw cold water on the concept that Apple will take a step back in features to try to snuff Amazon. \"They don't want to create any hint of a second-class product,\" he told CNET. \"They have no reason. They're selling as many as they can make. And this next-generation device is going to reinforce that supply-demand dynamic.\"\n### Response: ", "target": "Rumors about the iPad 3 are heating up as 2012 dawns .\nThe original iPad was unveiled in January 2010, iPad 2 in March .\nSources expect a higher-resolution screen and faster processor .\nMany wonder whether Apple plans to go after the cheaper, smaller Kindle Fire's market .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Get your morning fix at the ever-popular Espresso Vivace Roasteria (901 E Denny Way and 227 Yale Ave), or at one of the many branches of local chain Tully's. Restaurant Crush is still talk of the town. After a morning of coffee-fueled sightseeing, carb load at Caf\u00e9 Flora (2901 East Madison Street), which boasts a wholesome organic menu that just happens to be vegetarian. The hearty Sunday brunch is especially good. You can always put together your own lunch by picking up some fantastic produce at Pike Place Market, or you can just browse the stalls before filling up on fiery Tex-Mex fare at World Class Chili (93 Pike Street), which is as good as its name claims. It's also a decent choice for spice-loving vegetarians. Dinner in Seattle means picking from a huge selection of quality dining spots. Crush (2319 East Madison Street) is still talk of the town, which means you'll need to book well ahead to be sure of getting a table. The d\u00e9cor is minimal but warm, and the food is a fine example of what is known as Modern Northwest cuisine. Modern Northwest cuisine has Asian and Native American influences and is big on fresh local ingredients -- which means plenty of seafood. Another great place to sample the style is at Canlis (2576 Aurora Avenue North), which overlooks Lake Union and is famed for its extensive wine list. Chef Tom Douglas is reputed to be the originator of Northwest cuisine and his Dahlia Lounge (2001 4th Avenue) is famed for its desserts. Try the doughnuts with vanilla mascarpone, served still warm and utterly delicious. For something more European you should venture to Campagne (86 Pine Street) to dine on robust southern French cuisine while looking out over Pike Place and across Elliot Bay, while Sushi fans will want to grab a seat at Shiro's Sushi Restaurant (2401 2nd Avenue). If you're lucky you'll get to see Kyoto-born chef Shiro Kashiba masterfully preparing fish plucked from the waters of Puget Sound. Maneki (304 6th Avenue South) is another good bet for sushi, and if that doesn't satisfy your seafood cravings, make your way to Elliott's Oyster House on Pier 56.

At the first-ever White House Summit on Community Colleges, Obama said the the United States' decade-long decline from first to ninth in the world in the percentage of young people holding college degrees \"not only represents a huge waste of potential; in the global marketplace it represents a threat to our position as the world's leading economy.\" The aim of the summit is to explore ways to reach Obama's goal of an additional 5 million community college degrees by 2020, and to discuss community colleges' role in developing the U.S. work force, according to the White House. Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden, is host of the summit. She has a doctorate and is a full-time English professor at a community college. One private funding initiative comes from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which plans to invest $34.8 million over the next five years for a program called Completion by Design. The money will come in the form of grants to groups of community colleges that come up with new ways to make the college experience more responsive to the needs of today's students, according to a statement on the foundation's website. \"Most students today who are pursuing an education beyond high school are also balancing the demands of work and family,\" Melinda Gates said in the statement, \"yet colleges haven't adapted to this new reality.\" Also announced was the creation of the Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence, a $1 million award for community colleges that have outstanding academic and work force outcomes. Attending the summit are some 150 people, including community college leaders, students, philanthropists and businesspeople, as well as state and federal policy leaders. Community colleges across the United States have seen enrollment figures jump by 24 percent over the past few years, as unemployed workers look to retrain at those institutions, which offer lower tuition compared to their four-year counterparts. But the recession has forced some of those colleges to cut back on course offerings and put limits on enrollment. Recent figures from the Department of Education show that only about 30 percent of students who begin a two-year associates degree program actually finish up in three years. The need for more educated workers was highlighted in a recent study by the Center for Education and the Workforce at Georgetown University.  The study projects that by the year 2018, the United States will need around 22 million workers with new post-secondary degrees, associate degrees or better. The actual number of such workers is expected to fall short by about 3 million. The community colleges summit also includes a session on the Skills for America's Future initiative, the launching of which the president announced Monday at a meeting with his Economic Recovery Advisory Board. The initiative will make available more than $2 billion in competitive funds to community colleges over the next four years, the White House said in a statement. Examples of programs in the new initiative include Pacific Gas and Electric's work with community colleges to develop courses and training for energy jobs, professional literacy courses provided by McDonald's for managers across the country, and a pilot job training program in seven cities by Gap Inc., the statement said. A White House statement said the initiative is based on the same concept as the Educate to Innovate campaign, in which corporations develop specific programs to boost the performance of U.S. students in math, science, technology and engineering. Obama said a Skills for America's Future task force will coordinate federal efforts with corporate partners in the initiative. \"The goal is to ensure there are strong partnerships between growing industries and community college or training programs in every state in the country,\" Obama said in remarks at the White House Monday.

Activist Jim Pouillon was shot and killed Friday while protesting outside Owosso High School. Authorities say the suspect, Harlan James Drake, was offended by anti-abortion material that the activist had displayed across from the school all week. Drake, 33, is accused of shooting anti-abortion activist Jim Pouillon, 63, and Michael Fuoss, 61, who were killed in separate locations Friday morning, the prosecutor's office in Shiawassee County said. Authorities also have charged Drake with a felony firearm count and carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent, the prosecutor's office said. Drake also is suspected of \"attempting to locate a third victim without success,\" the office said. He was arraigned Friday and is being held without bail, the office said. It was not immediately known whether he had an attorney. Pouillon, whose anti-abortion activity was well-known in the area, was protesting across the street from Owosso High School about 7:20 a.m. Friday when he was killed by several shots fired from a passing vehicle, Owosso Police Chief Michael Compeau said.  Watch Compeau talk about the incident \u00bb . Several people witnessed the shooting, and one was able to provide a license number, he said. About an hour later, Owosso police officers found the suspect, Compeau said. \"At the time of his arrest, the suspect made statements that he was involved in another homicide in Shiawassee County the same day,\" he said. Sheriff George Braidwood said a call had come to a 911 dispatch center about 8:17 a.m. saying that an employee at Fuoss Gravel, outside Owosso, had discovered the owner, Michael Fuoss, dead. He had been shot several times, Braidwood said. Authorities believe that Fuoss and the suspect knew each other, Braidwood said. According to Sara Edwards of the county prosecutor's office, authorities do not believe that Drake knew Pouillon. Operation Save America, the anti-abortion group of which Pouillon was a member, said in a written statement that he was \"well known for his love of Christ and unborn children.\" The Owosso school district went into immediate lockdown after the shooting outside of the high school and remained so until the suspect was in custody, Compeau said . The high school's administration offered parents the option of picking up their children, he said. All after-school activities were canceled, he added.

So it goes for arguably the world's greatest race horse, who will attempt to extend her remarkable undefeated winning streak this weekend -- by running in the opposite direction. When Australian champion thoroughbred, Black Caviar, tries to rewrite the record books yet again in her 25th race at Sydney's TJ Smith Stakes Day on Saturday, it will be in a clockwise direction -- as is the norm for the New South Wales state. But it will be a change of pace for the Melbourne mare, better used to racing in an anti-clockwise direction in her native Victoria. A strange Australian tradition means horses race either left or right, depending on which state they're in -- clockwise for New South Wales and Queensland, and anti-clockwise for Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia. This will be just the fourth time the superstar six-year-old -- worth $7.5 million in prize money -- will have raced clockwise, and co-owner Colin Madden admitted it presented the biggest challenge to her undefeated winning streak. \"It does take time for her to settle in, running in the reverse direction,\" Madden told CNN. \"So that's our biggest concern. But I still can't see any horse catching her.\" Since demolishing the field in her first major win at the Danehill Stakes in 2009, an air of mystique has followed world champion thoroughbred. The wonder mare, who even has her own Twitter handle, has not just won all 24 of her races -- with the exception of Britain's Royal Ascot she has won them by staggering margins, destroying world-class fields to become one of the top-rated race horses on the planet. Her unblemished record is the second highest of all time, trailing behind only Hungarian horse Kincsem, which apparently took 54 races in the late 1800s. Black Caviar's remarkable career has elevated her to celebrity status in Australia, where she was named Sportswoman of the Year, graced the cover of Vogue, and launched a best-selling biography. And when she hits Randwick Racecourse on Saturday, there's no doubt the nation will be cheering her on to what bookmakers are tipping will be her 25th consecutive win. \"They've restructured the day so that the race runs after 5pm -- that way it will be shown on TV,\" Madden said. \"Black Caviar is the feature of the day. But luckily she doesn't know how much pressure is on her to win -- we're the ones who feel it, not her.\" The last time Black Caviar raced in a clockwise direction was at Britain's Diamond Jubilee Stakes, winning by the narrowest of margins in a heart-stopping finish. It was later revealed she had muscle strain in her legs which would put her out of action for eight months. Britain, like Australia, holds races in both directions, while the U.S. opts for counter-clockwise competitions. Madden didn't rule out another trip to Ascot for the magnificent mare, saying plans for future races would depend on her performance on Saturday. Beyond the track, Black Caviar may also have a profitable career as a breeding mare, with Madden hinting champion British thoroughbred, Frankel, could be a good match. Frankel, who wrapped up his stellar career in the Champion Stakes at Ascot with an unblemished 14-win record, has now been put out to stud -- with big returns expected for owner Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah. \"Frankel is definitely in the mix,\" Madden said. \"He's an extraordinary horse and it could be a wonderful match -- but nothing's been decided and it's something we're still assessing.\"\n### Response: ", "target": "Can Australian race horse Black Caviar extend unblemished winning streak to 25?\nWill race in Sydney's TJ Stakes this Saturday, in clockwise direction .\nWill be only the fourth time Melbourne mare has run in clockwise direction .\nFuture career depends on performance, owners contemplate Britain's Royal Ascot .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?\n### Input:(CNN) -- A U.S. military strike in southern Somalia Sunday was targeting Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of Al-Shabaab, the Somali-based group with ties to al Qaeda, according to three US officials. A drone operated by the U.S. Defense Department fired a Hellfire missile at a vehicle killing those inside, the officials said. But as of Tuesday, the Pentagon was unable to confirm whether Godane was killed, although he was the intended target. The military was authorized to try to kill Godane because of current intelligence indicating he posed an \"imminent threat\" against U.S. interests in the region, one official said. \"We have to be able to prove he was in the process of planning additional attacks,\" the official said. The official would not elaborate on what the intelligence might be. The officials confirmed this information in response to questioning from CNN, but declined to speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the situation. Officially, the Pentagon has only described the target of Sunday's strike as a \"senior leader\" affiliated with al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab. Godane has been a driving force behind Al-Shabaab declaring its affiliation to al Qaeda and has pressed for the group to launch attacks beyond Somalia. In recent years, U.S. officials had considered Al-Shabaab to be diminished in strength, but after the attack at the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya last year, officials have worried the group has demonstrated a renewed capability. The U.S. still sees the limited Western presence in Somalia as a potential target for Al-Shabaab, but the concerns also focus on U.S. targets throughout the Horn of Africa, the official said. U.S. officials are waiting for DNA evidence as well as intelligence gathered from local Somalis on the ground before they can confirm Godane was in the vehicle and killed by the drone strike. Somali officials have said the man killed was Sahal Iskudhuq, an Al-Shabaab operative who was close to Godane and involved in planning attacks over the years. The latest strike comes after a failed raid last year by U.S. Navy SEALS aiming to capture a man known as Ikrimah, who U.S. officials said was a senior militant with ties to al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?\n### Input: Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The suspected cyberattack that struck South Korean banks and media companies this week didn't originate from a Chinese IP address, South Korean officials said Friday, contradicting their previous claim. The Korea Communications Commission, a South Korean regulator, said that after \"detailed analysis,\" the IP address that was thought to be from China was determined to be an internal IP address from one of the banks that was infected by the malicious code. It said, though, that \"the government has confirmed that the attack was from a foreign land.\" An IP address is the number that identifies a network or device on the Internet. Widespread damage . The attack Wednesday damaged 32,000 computers and servers at media and financial companies, South Korea's Communications Commission said. It infected banks' and broadcasters' computer networks with a malicious program, or malware, that slowed or shut down systems, officials and the semiofficial Yonhap News Agency said. The military stepped up its cyberdefense efforts in response to the widespread outages, which hit nine companies, Yonhap reported, citing the National Police Agency. Government computer networks did not seem to be affected, Yonhap cited the National Computing and Information Agency as saying. A joint team from government, the military and private industry was responding. How the hackers got in and spread the malicious code remains under investigation, and analysts are examining the malware, a South Korean official close to the investigation said. Blaming North Korea in the past . South Korea has accused the North of similar hacking attacks before, including incidents in 2010 and 2012 that also targeted banks and media organizations. The North rejected the allegations. The outages come amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with the North angrily responding to a recent U.N. Security Council vote to impose tougher sanctions on Pyongyang after the country's latest nuclear test last month. Last week, North Korea invalidated its 60-year-old armistice with the South. It has threatened to attack its neighbor with nuclear weapons and has also threatened the United States. The armistice agreement, signed in 1953, ended the three-year war between North and South but left the two nations technically in a state of war. The United States has deployed B-52 bombers to conduct high-profile flyovers of its South Korean ally and announced that it will deploy new ground-based missile interceptors on its West Coast against the remote possibility that North Korea could strike the United States with long-range weapons.\n### Response : ", "target": "Wednesday's suspected cyberattack hit 32,000 computers .\nNine companies fell victim to the malicious code .\nGovernment computers weren't affected .\nSouth Korea has blamed the North in the past, which has rejected the allegations .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals issued the recall at the retail level November 9, directing pharmacies not to dispense contaminated lots of the drug, but gave no directions to patients who have the drug at home. It's made for a confusing situation for patients taking Ranbaxy's atorvastatin, the generic form of Lipitor. Cholesterol drug recalled over glass concerns . \"Patients are sandwiched between two groups who are being less than helpful: the FDA and Ranbaxy,\" said Lisa Gill, editor of prescription drugs at Consumer Reports. A Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman couldn't explain why the recall didn't direct consumers to stop taking the drug even though patients might have received the contaminated pills. The spokeswoman, Sarah Clark-Lynn, referred questions about the recall to Ranbaxy, which issued a one-paragraph statement on its website and did not return phone calls and e-mails from CNN. The statement said that \"select batches\" of the medicine may contain \"small glass particles approximately less than 1mm in size\" and that the recall was being conducted \"out of an abundance of caution.\" It did not give consumers guidance about what to do with supplies of the drug at home. \"In my recent memory, there has never been anything like this,\" Gill said. \"It makes my palms sweat just thinking about it.\" Advice to patients . Between 3 million and 4 million people take Ranbaxy's atorvastatin, according to Ross Muken, senior managing director at ISI Group. The company has over a 40% share of the generic Lipitor market. One major pharmacy, Express Scripts, is telling patients it will not exchange Ranbaxy atorvastatin for another brand, according to Brian Henry, vice president of corporate communications for Express Scripts. \"Ranbaxy, in conjunction with the FDA, has determined there are no safety concerns associated with continued use of atorvastatin in the patients' possession,\" a recorded message tells consumers who call Express Scripts. Pharmacists at several CVS pharmacies said it was all right to keep taking already-filled prescriptions of Ranbaxy atorvastatin, but the company would exchange it for another brand at a customer's request. Consumer Reports is advising consumers to take potentially contaminated medicine back to the pharmacy and request another brand, Gill said. A company with a history . Ranbaxy, India's largest pharmaceutical company and the 12th largest generics maker in the world, has had quality problems in the past. The FDA has accused the company of \"a pattern of systemic fraudulent conduct,\" including taking shortcuts in crucial quality tests.

{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.\n### Input:HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's central bank will introduce a $50 billion note -- enough to buy just two loaves of bread -- as a way of fighting cash shortages amid spiraling inflation. Zimbabwe's dollar is virtually worthless, with foreign currency now being used to purchase basic items. The country's acting finance minister, Patrick Chinamasa, made the announcement in a government gazette released Saturday. Although Chinamasa did not give the date on which the $50 billion and new $20 billion notes would come into circulation, an official at the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe said the notes would be distributed to all banks by the end of Monday. Zimbabwe is grappling with hyperinflation now officially estimated at 231 million percent, and its currency is fast losing its value. As of Friday, one U.S. dollar was trading at around ZW$25 billion. When the government issued a $10 billion note just three weeks ago, it bought 20 loaves of bread. That note now can purchase less than half of one loaf. Realizing the worthlessness of the currency, the RBZ has allowed most goods and services to be charged in foreign currency. As a result, grocery purchases, government hospital bills, property sales, rent, vegetables and even mobile phone recharge cards are now paid for in foreign currency, as the worthless Zimbabwe dollar virtually ceases to be legal tender. Once a regional economic model, Zimbabwe is in the throes of an economic crisis, with unemployment running at more than 80 percent and many families unable to afford a square meal. President Robert Mugabe's critics blame his policies for the economic meltdown, but he says the West is sabotaging his efforts. In order to attract foreign currency, Zimbabwe's central bank has, since September, licensed at least 1,000 shops to sell goods in foreign currency. All mobile phone service providers are now licensed to accept foreign exchange for airtime and other services. John Robertson, an economist in Zimbabwe, said he's puzzled by the introduction of the $50 billion and $20 billion notes. \"I am not really sure what these notes would be for,\" he said. \"No one now accepts the local currency. It is a waste of resources to print Zimbabwe dollar notes now. Who accepts a currency that loses value by almost 100 percent daily?\" In August, the RBZ slashed ten zeros from the currency. But the zeroes have bounced back with more vigor. A power-sharing deal between Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai signed in September, and brokered by former South African leader Thabo Mbeki, raised hopes of halting Zimbabwe's plunge into economic destruction. But the pact has stalled over the allocation of key cabinet ministries, with Tsvangirai accusing Mugabe of grabbing all key posts such as defense, home affairs, local government, foreign affairs and finance.\n### Response: ", "target": "Zimbabwe grappling with hyperinflation estimated at 231 million percent .\nAs of Friday, one U.S. dollar was trading at around ZW$25 billion .\nThe country slashed 10 zeros from the amount of its worthless currency in August .\nRBZ has allowed most goods and services to be charged in foreign currency .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Thirty-five percent of respondents said they should be required to leave, up from 26 percent last year. But while Americans might be split on how to tackle the country's immigration problem, they agree on one thing \u2014\u00a0that shutting down the government is not an appropriate response to Obama's move, a tactic floated by some Republicans. Americans oppose such a move 68-25 percent. Still, Obama's unilateral action has likely contributed to his strikingly low approval rating in the survey. With just 39 percent of Americans approving of his job performance in the latest Quinnipiac poll, he's nearing his all-time low approval rating of 38 percent. Fifty-four percent disapprove of the job he's doing. And Americans now trust Republicans in Congress more to do what's best for the nation than Obama, by 47-42 percent. While the poll shows a majority of Americans, 51 percent, are happy the GOP has taken over the Senate, two-thirds of the nation expects more gridlock over the next two years, and they're split over who will be to blame. Forty-four percent believe it will be Obama's fault, while 42 percent blame Republicans. The survey was conducted among 1,623 registered voters from Nov. 18-23 with live interviews via landline and cell phone, and has a margin of error of 2.4 percent.\n### Response:", "target": "A new poll out from Quinnipiac University finds a split on approval of Obama's immigration plan .\nThirty-five percent of Americans, a new high, believe those here illegally should be required to leave .\nAt 39 percent approval, Obama is nearing his all-time low approval rating of 38 percent .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

for instance , their implication in calcium homeostasis in the bone and other tissues . furthermore , vitamin k - dependent proteins are present in invertebrates and other species lacking a coagulation cascade . a later addition to these functions has been produced by studies on gas6 , the subject of the recent report by ekman and colleagues . gas6 and \n the highly similar anticoagulant protein s were discovered to be ligands of a family of formerly orphan receptor protein tyrosine kinases , the tam family . \n the function of this family of receptors was soon recognized to be important in mechanisms of defense against injuries , especially through their action as regulators of inflammation , apoptotic cell clearance and platelet - endothelial activation [ 4 - 7 ] . \n owing to the low concentration of gas6 in plasma and its similarity to protein s , which is 1,000-fold more concentrated , creating a reliable test to detect its concentration under different disease conditions has been a challenge . despite these difficulties , \n several groups have reported that gas6 acts as an acute - phase reactant , increasing its concentration during sepsis . \n the present study by ekman and colleagues provides detailed evidence of this increase by comparing at the same time patients with different diagnoses related to septicemia - including severe sepsis , sepsis , systemic inflammatory response syndrome without infection , and verified infection - blood donors , systemic inflammatory response syndrome patients with infections , and patients without systemic inflammatory response syndrome as controls . \n furthermore , the study determines the concentration of soluble axl , a processed form of the receptor that is present in plasma at molar excess compared with gas6 and that seems to capture most of the gas6 , forming a stable complex . \n previous studies have clearly established that gas6 is increased in septic patients , and its concentration correlates with disease severity . in the present study , the authors show that plasma gas6 increased in all conditions studied , irrespective of the presence of infection . \n other conditions with an important activation of inflammation , such as pancreatitis , also show increased levels of gas6 . \n taken together , these data suggest that gas6 would be a general marker of inflammatory conditions rather than a specific marker for sepsis \n . this hypothesis would fit well with the view of the tam receptor system as a brake for the innate immunity . \n gas6 itself shows anti - inflammatory properties in certain cells , reducing cytokine synthesis , but could also orchestrate the course of inflammation by favoring platelet and leukocyte interactions with the endothelium . \n the study of the role of gas6 and its tam receptors in human pathology has just begun . \n recent developments include assays to test the genetic variability of the gas6 gene   and to test the tam receptors in the human genome \n . these assays would allow correlating plasma parameters with the genetic background , leading to a deeper understanding of the possible role of the gas6-tam system in sepsis . \n \n### Response :", "target": "vitamin k - dependent proteins are not only essential regulators of blood coagulation . \n a recent paper in critical care describes the levels of the vitamin k - dependent gas6 and the soluble form of its receptor axl in plasma from patients with sepsis of systemic inflammation . \n the results confirm that gas6 is elevated during septicemia , but the fact that inflammatory conditions without infection produce a similar effect suggests it is inflammation that induces the synthesis of gas6 , rather than the interactions with bacteria or other infectious agents . \n the soluble form of the gas6 receptor axl was induced less compared with the effect observed in gas6 . \n this is important as the two proteins form an inactive complex in plasma , suggesting that a functional gas6 form could be synthesized under these conditions . \n gas6 has been proposed as a broad regulator of the innate immune response . \n gas6 synthesis is therefore likely to be a regulatory mechanism during systemic inflammation . \n recent advances provide the necessary tools for further research , including genetic screenings of the components of this system .", "origin": "pubmed.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?\n### Input :(Wired) -- We're all familiar with Apple's love affair for thin devices. Although the third-generation iPad surprised many by gaining about half a millimeter of thickness, it looks like Apple could be back to trimming product dimensions by using a new kind of display technology in the next iPhone. Instead of using a display comprising a number of separate layers, Apple could use in-cell touch display technology, according to a Friday report from Digitimes. The report says Apple would be sourcing its in-cell displays from Toshiba and Sharp. \"The advantage of in-cell is that you're streamlining the manufacturing process, so in time you should be able to drive efficiencies and reduce cost,\" IHS analyst Rhoda Alexander told Wired. \"Additionally, by reducing the number of layers, you reduce the size and thickness of the device, making it thinner and lighter.\" If the iPhone has a larger 4- to 4.3-inch display, as some reports expect it to, that extra glass could add a bit of heft to the iPhone's weight. Thus, Apple would need to find new ways to keep the phone from gaining too much weight. Currently, the iPhone's \"on cell\" display is layered a bit like a sandwich (or if you're feeling like dessert, think of a trifle). At the very bottom, you've got the back light. Directly above that, the LCD section, which houses the red-, green-, and blue-colored pixels of the display. Then there's a layer of glass. On top of that is the capacitive touch layer, which is then topped off by a tough layer of Gorilla Glass. The middle layer of glass separates the liquid crystal portion of the display from the touch portion. In-cell display tech eliminates that middle layer of glass, combining the LCD and touch sections of the display into a single layer. One way this can be successfully accomplished is by \"multiplexing\" the electrodes normally used to relay touch input -- that is, using the same electrodes to handle the signals for both touch control and the pixels of the LCD, according to a 2010 IHS report on touch-screen displays. In-cell technology isn't currently deployed in any shipping cellphones. And it shouldn't be confused with the similar-sounding \"Super\" technologies from Samsung. Super AMOLED and Super LCD screens use on-cell technology rather than in-cell. Right now, in-cell touch displays are still an emerging technology. So while the core technology promises long-term benefits, yield rates could be a problem in the shorter terms, Alexander says. But that's the deal with any new technological process, isn't it? In the months before the new iPad was announced, yield rates for Apple's Retina display were a huge question mark. So is in-cell really something Apple would pull the trigger on? \"We do believe that the next iPhone display will implement in-cell touch,\" DisplaySearch's Paul Semenza told Wired via e-mail. But of course, we'll have to wait and see how it pans out when the next iPhone actually debuts . Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you outline the content?\n### Input:(CNN) -- The comparison would probably irk Michael Jackson purists, but it's easy to see why some of Kilian Martin's fans liken his fancy footwork to the late \"King of Pop.\" The Spanish skateboarder's stylish 360-degree toe spins, seen through the artful lens of filmmaker and friend Brett Novak, have a mesmerizing quality -- much like the rest of his repertoire. Martin's artistic flourishes may not be as grandiose as some you'll witness in a skate park; you won't find the 27-year-old chasing air in halfpipes, for example. His tricks are more delicate, his approach more artistic. \"To me skateboarding is an art form,\" Martin tells CNN's Human to Hero series. \"I'm able to put my thoughts into it, picture stuff and then draw it ... using the world as my canvas and the skateboard as a brush.\" Those canvases, as millions have witnessed on YouTube, range from abandoned train station ticket halls and derelict water parks to art galleries and deserted cityscapes in the U.S., Asia and Europe -- the place where Martin's skateboarding odyssey started. Born and raised in Madrid, skating didn't figure much in his early childhood. Like most kids he played soccer but also competed as a gymnast and enjoyed surfing on family vacations in the Canary Islands. The athleticism learned at the gym has clearly informed his skating style, but it was a love of the waves that ultimately influenced his future. \"When I was in Madrid I couldn't surf, so I thought that skateboarding could help my surfing,\" he explains. \"That's basically why I started skating. Then I got hooked ... and I stopped going to gymnastics when I was 16 years old. I love skateboarding because of the creative side of it. There's so much variety, so much you can do.\" Streets ahead . Martin has made his name in a branch of skating called street freestyle made famous by U.S. pro legend Rodney Mullen. Often referred to as the godfather of the genre, Mullen invented numerous moves in the 1980s which are now commonplace today, including the flatground ollie and a host of flip tricks. \"Freestyle skateboarding is pretty much how skateboarding started,\" says Martin. \"In freestyle skating there aren't really any rules and you can skate however you want. What I do is mix that freestyle skating with the streets (doing) spins, handstands and rail tricks on obstacles.\" Initially, he plied his trade as a competition skater but after winning the 2010 World Cup freestyle in Paderborn, Germany he switched to making films. None are particularly long -- most last around five minutes -- but all are jam-packed with tricks that Martin makes look easy. But the reality is often rather different. \"Sometimes I'll be trying tricks hundreds of times and I'll be completely exhausted and not really wanting to do it anymore but I push myself,\" he reveals. There is also the task of knitting separate tricks together into a flowing sequence -- which is not easy in freestyle, a discipline sometimes derided for being a jerky, stop-start affair. \"Sometimes I'll have my eyes closed and picture myself (doing a trick). As I am filming it my mind and (visualizing) how it looks, I start to think of tricks I've done before and how I can keep the flow and how I can make a variation,\" Martin explains. Evolving tricks is just as important as creating new ones, he says, pointing to his embellishment of the \"daffy\" -- an old and relatively simple maneuver where a skater straddles two boards, riding one behind the other. \"I've been able through the years to take that trick from flat ground to obstacles and come up with some ideas (integrating) the ollie, heelflip and going backwards. It's something that I'm proud of,\" he says. Magnum Opus . Martin's talent has led to some unique opportunities, like skating to George Bizet's \"Carmen,\" in a commercial for a brand of whisky. He teamed up with a choreographer Miguel Elias for the two-day shoot at the Avenida Theater in Buenos Aires, Argentina at the end of last year. \"When I was skating Elias was giving me ideas. It was something very new to me. I listen when people give me suggestions for new tricks but a lot of the time it doesn't make sense because they're not skaters,\" Martin says. \"But a lot of what he was saying was making sense ... he came up for an idea for a wall trick. I was like 'wow,' this guy has so much style. Afterwards, I had a whole new respect for him.\" More recently, Martin has hooked up with his buddy Novak again to shoot the next installment of his freestyle adventures. Life could not be better for the Spaniard, who is now based in California -- the cradle of the sport. \"What really makes me happy is making skate videos,\" he says. \"My goal is to develop my skating, basically take it to another level. It's not really about changing skateboarding, but changing my own skateboarding. \"It's something that I want to do for the rest of my life, as long as I have legs ... well even if I don't, 'cause I'll do a handstand!\" Read more: The 'Frog King' who spawned a golden legacy .

If details are worked out and approved by state legislators, it would end the shutdown over how to resolve a $5 billion deficit that has lasted two weeks so far. \n  \n Dayton said the government would be back in business \"very soon,\" but didn't say exactly when. \n  \n The two sides agreed on a proposal that would raise $1.4 billion in new revenue, half by delaying state aid checks to school districts and the other half by selling tobacco payment bonds. It was a big sacrifice by Dayton, who had made new income taxes a central plank in his campaign last year and the centerpiece of his budget. \n  \n Republicans said they agreed to drop a list of policy changes and a plan to cut the state workforce by 15 percent. \n  \n \"It was about making sure that we get a deal that we can all be disappointed in, but a deal that is done, a budget that was balanced, a state that was back to work,\" said Republican House Speaker Kurt Zellers, who appeared with Dayton and Senate Majority Leader Amy Koch after the private meeting. \n  \n The glum looks on their faces testified to a hard bargain. \n  \n \"Nobody is going to be happy with this, which is the essence of real compromise,\" Dayton said. \n  \n The date of a special legislative session to pass a budget and end the shutdown has not been set. Some terms of the deal still need to be filled in. \n  \n The shutdown has idled 22,000 state employees, closed state parks and rest stops and cut off funding to many social services. It has cost the state millions in the cost of preparing for the shutdown and in lost revenue since then. \n  \n The interruption has also prevented entrepreneurs and professionals from getting state licenses. The latest licensing snag threatens to stop the sale of Miller, Coors and other popular beers in the state within days. \n  \n Payments by the state to schools and local governments have continued, and a court has taken some of the pressure off by restarting the flow of cash to programs ranging from child care assistance to home meal services for the elderly. \n  \n The governor sounded weary earlier Thursday when he announced he would embrace the GOP proposal, which was offered on the eve of the shutdown. \n  \n The deal is contingent on approval by the Legislature, no easy task after an election in which a more conservative Republican caucus took power. Koch and Zellers said they believed rank-and-file legislators would approve it. Republicans hold narrow margins in both chambers, and Democratic minority leaders weren't in on the deal-making. \n  \n Unions, and some Democrats, sharply criticized the plan as irresponsible for borrowing against future revenue. \n  \n \"More debt and more borrowing only make this bad situation worse,\" state Rep.

Isabelle Stapleton is \"awake\" and \"responding,\" according to Sara Swanson, Benzie County prosecuting attorney, after being in critical care for carbon monoxide poisoning following a grisly incident last week in which her mother allegedly attempted to take both of their lives. \"Her condition has continued to improve every day\" since the weekend, Swanson said. On the evening of September 3, Kelli Stapleton and her daughter were transported to hospitals for treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning after police discovered them unconscious inside their family vehicle in a wooded area, according to Sgt. Malcolm Irwin of Michigan State Police. Officers found the vehicle locked with two charcoal grills burning inside, emitting carbon monoxide and using up the oxygen, according to Irwin. Matt Stapleton, Isabelle's father, had called police earlier in the day because \"nobody had seen\" her or her mother \"all day,\" Irwin said. Isabelle was transported to the critical care unit at DeVos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where she remained until she opened her eyes over the weekend, Swanson said. Kelli Stapleton was taken into custody last Wednesday after receiving doctor's clearance. She was arraigned on Thursday and is charged with one count of attempted murder. She is being held without bail and is to appear in court on September 16 for a preliminary examination, according to Swanson. In a preliminary examination, a judge rules on whether there is sufficient evidence to support the charges. In her blog, titled \"The Status Woe,\" Kelli Stapleton complained of suffering from \"a severe case of battle fatigue\" on the day of the alleged murder-suicide attempt. The blog is devoted to Isabelle and the post from September 3 mentions the issues surrounding her autism treatment. Stapleton's attorney, Anthony Cicchelli, had no comment.

The two women, both active in local politics, are friendly. They stop to talk when they see each other. But folks in Mingo County are about to get a whole lot closer to Crum, who was appointed sheriff Thursday by the county's commissioners. The former sheriff, Crum's husband, was shot and killed this week. \"She's a good person,\" Crawford said about Crum. \"She's always seemed like a strong person too.\" According to County Commissioner David Baisden, Crum was born and raised in Mingo County. She met her husband, Eugene Crum, when she was 14, and they married in 1975. The Crums have two children -- a son and a daughter, both grown -- and grandchildren. \"They have been a pillar in the community and done everything that they felt was the right thing to do, and we feel this is the right thing for us to do,\" Baisden said about Crum's appointment. She'll serve out the rest of her husband's term, which runs through the end of next year. Crum has prior no law enforcement experience, but she will have \"plenty of help,\" Baisden said. Williamson Police Chief Dave Rockel will \"manage the law enforcement end\" of the sheriff's department, he explained. John Mark Hubbard, president of the Mingo County Commission, said Crum's appointment is like an extension of her husband's legacy. The commission voted unanimously. \"We have the full support of the sheriff's department, right down to every man that we spoke to as a deputy, and their support for this is overwhelming. Now we ask for your support.\" 'She lost everything' Crum was sworn in as sheriff on Thursday night at the county courthouse, just blocks from where her husband was shot. She did not speak, but she hugged 22 deputies who came to the ceremony, Hubbard said. Baisden said he met with Crum earlier in the day, and that she was understandably emotional. He explained another part of the rationale behind her appointment. \"She lost everything she had. She lost her husband, and would have lost a paycheck,\" he said. \"We told her we felt like this is the sure way that we could take care of her until she got on her feet.\" An election to replace Crum is set to be held in May 2014. Whoever wins will take office on January 1, 2015. Photographs of the new sheriff on her Facebook page show a woman with an easy smile. She holds a paintbrush in one picture -- a dog, a baby and her husband tight in others.

A farmer harvests wheat in a field on the outskirts of Kabul, Afghanistan, last summer. The farmers are participating in programs sponsored by the U.S. Agency for International Development, which is offering seeds, fertilizers and improved irrigation to the region in an effort to stop poppy crops and, ultimately, the production of opium and heroin. Observers have noticed a significant decline in the opium trade in Afghanistan, with the number of poppy-free provinces increasing from 13 in 2007 to 18 in 2008, according to a U.N. report released last year. Opium cultivation in the country, which has 34 provinces, dropped by about 20 percent in a year, the U.N. reported in August. \"It's a challenge to deliver assistance in a war zone -- you can hear fighter jets flying above us right now,\" said Rory Donohoe, a USAID development officer. \"At the end of the day, what we found is successful is that we work in areas that we can work,\" he told CNN in a recent interview in Helmand province. \"We come to places like this demonstration farm where Afghans can come here to a safe environment, get training, pick up seeds and fertilizer, then go back to districts of their own.\"  Watch Afghans speak about the change in their farming practices \u00bb . Many of Afghanistan's northern and eastern provinces have already benefited from USAID alternative farming programs, which have doled out more than $22 million to nearly 210,000 Afghans to build or repair 435 miles (700 kilometers) of roads and some 2,050 miles (3,300 kilometers) of irrigation and drainage canals. Giving Afghan farmers improved access to markets and improved irrigation is successfully weaning them away from poppy production, according to officials at USAID. Over the years, opium and heroin -- both derivatives of the poppy -- have served as a major source of revenue for the insurgency, most notably the Taliban movement that once ruled Afghanistan. \"If you can just help the people of Afghanistan in this way, the fighting will go away,\" said Abdul Qadir, a farmer in Lashkar Gah. \"The Taliban and other enemies of the country will also disappear.\"\n### Response :", "target": "USAID offering seeds, other help to encourage Afghan farmers to grow wheat .\nAgency trying to wean Afghan farmers from poppy production .\nPoppy plants used to produce opium and heroin .\nOpium, heroin has been a major source of revenue for the Taliban .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Or are the elephants under the big top healthy and thriving in a caring environment? Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey elephants pass the U.S. Capitol in a parade this week in Washington. That's the issue a federal judge must decide in a 9-year-old legal dispute pitting four animal rights groups against the nation's most famous circus, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. Closing arguments will be heard Wednesday in the case in which the circus is accused of mistreating its 54 Asian elephants, which are protected under the 1973 Endangered Species Act. Under the law, endangered species cannot be \"harmed, harassed, wounded, injured or killed.\" The circus \"is in fact in violation of the federal Endangered Species Act as a result of their routine practices that they use on the elephants,\" according to Tracy Silverman, general counsel for the Animal Welfare Institute. Silverman alleges that the circus uses \"bull hooks\" and electrical prods called \"hot shots\" to train and manage the elephants and that handlers chain the elephants for extended periods of time. These practices violate federal law, Silverman says. But the circus says that no evidence was presented at the six-week trial that such tools as bull hooks and hot shots are used on elephants. \"Ringling Bros.' practices are well known to the federal government who regulates their business,\" says Ringling Bros. attorney Michelle Pardo. The tools the circus uses to handle animals \"are time-tested, approved and commonly used,\" she added. Pardo insists the trial evidence \"showed the elephants are healthy, well cared for and they're thriving in Ringling Bros. care.\" Besides the Animal Welfare Institute, other groups involved in the suit are the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Fund for Animals and Born Free USA, acting with the Animal Protection Institute. While the animal rights groups allege the circus \"severely mistreats and abuses\" elephants, the circus says the animals are not only healthy but \"really do benefit from the enrichment that the circus provides.\" No immediate ruling is expected from the judge.\n### Response:", "target": "Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey accused of mistreating 54 Asian elephants .\nJudge is set to hear closing arguments in nearly decade-old legal dispute .\nAnimal rights groups say circus violating 1973 Endangered Species Act .\nCircus attorney says elephants \"thriving in Ringling Bros. care.\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given review.\n### Input:(CNN) -- Having terrorized English Premier League defenses all season, Uruguay's Luis Suarez turned his considerable striking talents to putting the frighteners on the England national team. And then some -- England were left reeling as the Liverpool forward's two goals earned Uruguay a vital 2-1 win in their World Cup Group D match in Sao Paulo Thursday . This barely four weeks are undergoing knee surgery to all but end England's interest in the 2014 World Cup and keep alive Uruguay's hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages. It was a performance that Roy Hodgson's team were all too familiar with -- the Uruguayan scored 31 goals for Liverpool in the league last season -- but could do nothing about. Equally it was a performance that must have been particularly tough on the five Liverpool players that started for England and especially for Steven Gerrard, who played an unfortunate part in Suarez's winning goal. Suarez had watched from the bench as Uruguay stumbled to defeat in their opening match against Costa Rica but he didn't take long to make an impact against England. Plenty of questions had been asked if Suarez could be 100% fit after missing a month's football, but if anything he appeared refreshed by his layoff. A busy first half was capped with a goal six minutes before the break when Suarez headed past goalkeeper Joe Hart after Edinson Cavani's diagonal chip had split England's defense. Suarez almost beat the Manchester City keeper again four minutes into the second half with a low inswinging corner. Hart managed to bat the ball away off the line this time but should have been picking the ball out of the net three minutes later when Cavani was played through. A goal seemed certain but the Paris St Germain striker conspired to squirt his shot wide. The miss seemed to rejuvenate England who began to play their way back into the game. Having headed against the bar in the opening half, Wayne Rooney, restored to his more favored central attacking role, forced a fine smothering save from Fernando Muslera in the 53rd minute and Daniel Sturridge also went close shortly after. Rooney's first goal in three World Cup finals put England back on level terms in the 75th minute. When the Manchester United striker side-footed home from Glen Johnson's cross England looked to have seized the initiative at a crucial time. But it didn't last long as Suarez pounced on an error by his Liverpool teammate Gerrard in the 84th minute. A speculative punt up field glanced off the head of the England captain and into the path of Suarez who steadied himself before lashing in his 41st international goal. It was a goal that typified Suarez's predatory instincts, both in the finish but also the way he had almost expected that the ball would fall into his path. Defeat leaves England pointless from their two opening matches. At the very least they will need to beat Costa Rica in their final match and hope other results go their way. \"We're devastated,\" England manager Roy Hodgson told ITV Sport after the match. \"I thought we had done enough to get a draw. Suarez's first goal was exceptional. The second he was bit fortunate to get himself free. We know what he can do.\" Lucky or not, Suarez's winner puts Uruguay level on three points with Costa Rica and Italy who play in Recife on Friday.

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.(CNN) -- \"Within the oil crisis and climate change there is the opportunity for an economic, social and cultural renaissance the likes of which we have never seen before,\" says environmentalist and perma-culture designer Rob Hopkins. Falmouth in England is one of many towns across the world that have 'transition' initiatives. \"If only we can just unleash all the creativity and genius around us, rather than just lurching from crisis to crisis.\" Hopkins is the founder of the \"Transition Town\" movement, and the author of its bible, \"The Transition Handbook.\" The movement was founded in Totnes, Devon, and Kinsale, Ireland, in 2005 and 2006, with the aim of helping those communities prepare for the twin challenges of peak oil output and climate change. Since then it's spread across the United Kingdom and to towns across the world. There are now 60 other projects already in action, and nearly 700 others considering getting involved. There is even a Transition storyline on the popular BBC radio soap opera, \"The Archers.\" Fundamentally, it's a grassroots initiative, and Hopkins believes that the move to an oil-free society is about community and individuals more than industry and government. \"We use about nine barrels of oil each per year in the UK,\" he says. \"The first three we can influence ourselves, the next three are down to our communities, and the final third are the Government's responsibility. We try and focus on the first six barrels.\" Transition works by helping local people get together and find ways they can reduce their reliance on oil as a community, and cut their carbon footprint in the process. In Totnes, Transition have created local food guides, formed a sustainable building company, given talks and lectures to landowners and local government officials to show them how peak oil and climate change affect their management decisions. They have even created an alternative currency, the \"Totnes Pound\", which can only be spent within the town in an attempt to localize the economy and reduce reliance on imports. The fact that so much food was brought into this rural, agricultural region from many hundreds of miles away seemed one of the crazier excesses of the cheap oil era Hopkins believes is already over. In an attempt to change this -- both to prepare for the day it becomes too expensive and increase the town's resilience - Transition Totnes encourages everyone to grow their own food. They operate a \"garden share\" scheme that unites keen gardeners without land with those who don't have the time, or fitness, to tend their own patch. They are also aiming to make Totnes the nut tree capital of Britain. \"We have identified unloved and derelict bits of the town, planted fruit and nut trees and trained the people living nearby how to look after them,\" says Hopkins. \"You can get more protein and carbohydrate per hectare from a hybrid nut tree than anything else.\" So far, Transition estimate between 10 and 15 per cent of the population have had some involvement with them. Ideas spreading from the fringes to the mainstream . Totnes is a town with a strong tradition of alternative lifestyles and environmental awareness, and exactly the sort of place Transition would appeal: the high street is crammed with health food shops and healers. But in the two years the program has been in operation, word has spread and the concept seems to have struck a chord with thousands of people across Britain, many in areas without such a radical precedent. \"Now the people getting involved now aren't just the usual suspects, the hard core environmentalists,\" says Hopkins. \"We have professionals, teachers, the Women's Institute. \"The Archers\" storyline was, for me, a real indication we had reached into Middle England. \"One of the reasons why Transition has grown so fast is that it's expanded into a vacuum. \"People have known about climate change for some time, and now the idea of peak oil is spreading fast. But there was a real lack of action, what could you do after you'd felt bad about it all for a few days? That's where Transition comes in. \"It's not about finding out whose fault it is and chaining yourself to them, it's about rediscovering old skills, like thrift; being practical, taking control. \"Fifty years ago we all had these skills, but now we've become the most useless generation ever to walk this planet. One of the nice things about Transition is that it brings older people in and makes them feel valued -- because they know these things.\" Transition works by uniting local communities and forming groups to tackle individual areas -- energy, food, housing -- with the ultimate aim being the construction of an \"Energy Descent Plan\" to plot out a twenty year divorce from oil. \"The British government's own plans for the future assumes oil will be $65 a barrel in 2010. Well, it has already hit $136, with many analysts predicting $200 soon, so it's quite clear they are not thinking this through. \"I think [UK prime minister] Gordon Brown could really do with being honest about energy. At the moment he isn't and that's a very dangerous situation to be in. It's no good saying we'll up North Sea production or going off to talk to the King of Saudi Arabia, we need leadership that takes a proper appraisal.\" Hopkins acknowledges that it's hard for governments to take action until they know the country is behind them, but argues again, that's where Transition comes to the rescue. \"We can help create that mandate,\" he says, \"and revitalize democracy in the process.\"\n### Response :", "target": "'Transition towns' help local people get together to work to toward an oil-free future .\nHarnessing creativity to prepare for oil peak and counter climate change .\nPart of wider plan to localize solutions and strengthen democracy .\nCurrent record oil prices help  bring 'Transition Town' ideas into mainstream .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What are the central ideas presented?(CNN) -- There will be no new gun laws after the Aurora shooting for the basic reason that the American people do not want them. Over the past 20 years, support for gun control has collapsed in the United States. Three-quarters of Americans want to keep the right to own handguns, weapons whose only function is to kill human beings at close range. In 1959, 60% of Americans wanted handguns banned outright for all but police officers. Little to gain, lots to lose for Obama and Romney on guns . Responding to public opinion, states have loosened gun laws to allow citizens to carry weapons with them almost anywhere they go. In Georgia, Arizona, Tennessee and Virginia, it's legal to carry a gun into a bar. Guns and booze: What could go wrong? But here's the odd thing: At the same time as Americans have become more enthusiastic about gun rights, fewer and fewer Americans actually want to own a gun themselves. In the 1990s, the proportion of Americans who kept a gun in the home tumbled from one-half to one-third. And while gun ownership has risen in the Obama years, it remains lower than in the 1960s when strong majorities of the American people demanded stricter laws. How can we make sense of this weird divergence between beliefs and behavior? Americans support gun rights because they believe guns are necessary for self-protection. As the Georgia lawmaker who introduced the law allowing guns to be carried in bars explained: . \"Folks were being robbed, assaulted -- it was becoming an issue of personal safety. The police aren't going to be able to protect you. They're going to be checking out the crime scene after you and your family's been shot or injured or assaulted or raped.\" At the same time, people hesitate to own guns themselves because they recognize that keeping a gun in the house is a dangerous thing to do. A gun in the house minimally doubles the risk that a household member will kill himself or herself. (Some studies put the increase in suicide risk as high as 10 times.) An American is 50% more likely to be shot dead by his or her own hand than to be shot dead by a criminal assailant. More than 30,000 Americans injure themselves with guns every year. The good news is that as America becomes safer, fewer and fewer Americans feel the need for a weapon. The overall violent crime index has tumbled by one-third since the early 1990s. The worst crimes -- murder and rape -- have declined even more. American citizens are safer today from crime than at almost any time since record-keeping began, very likely safer than at any time in the history of the country. Americans perceive these improvements in the safety of their immediate neighborhood. Back in the early 1980s, half of Americans said they feared to walk alone at night near their own homes. By the early 2000s, only one-third expressed such fears. (Those fears have ticked up a little in the last few years, even as crime rates continue to fall, but again they remain way below historic peaks.) Yet unfortunately, Americans are not, however, nearly so accurate at assessing national trends. In the mid-2000s, when crime rates were declining fast, almost 70% of Americans wrongly said that crime rates had risen over the past year. Analysis: Why gun controls are off the agenda in America . What force on earth could convince Americans that down is up? The most powerful force of all: television. TV news -- and especially local TV news -- is dominated by news of violent crime, the more spectacular and murderous the better. TV news creates a false picture of a country under attack by rampaging criminals, and especially nonwhite criminals. The people who watch the most TV news, Americans older than 50, also happen to be the group most likely to own a gun. Only one-fifth of young Americans own a gun; one-third of over-50 Americans do. Republicans are twice as likely to own a gun as Democrats. Maybe not so coincidentally, Republicans are more likely to watch the scariest news channel of them all: Fox. Whites are twice as likely to own a gun as nonwhites -- and it may also not be a coincidence that gun purchases have suddenly spiked since November 2008. Proponents of gun control are baffled that horrific massacres such as the one in Aurora, Colorado, do not lead to stricter gun control. They have their causation backward. The more terrifyingly criminal the world looks, the more ineffective law enforcement seems, the more Americans demand the right to deadly weapons with which to defend themselves. It is local TV programming directors, not the National Rifle Association, who are tirelessly persuading Americans that they need to strap a gun to their legs before heading to the mall. And what will change those attitudes is not more atrocity stories, but instead the reassuring truth: The United States is safe and getting safer, safer than ever before in its history. The police can protect you, and will, and do. And a gun in the house is not a guarantee of personal security -- it is instead a standing invitation to family tragedy. The cold dead hands from which they pry the gun are very unlikely to be the hands of a heroic minuteman defending home and hearth against intruders. They are much more likely to be the hands of a troubled adolescent or a clumsy child. In the land of the Second Amendment, nobody will take your guns away. But if you love your children, you should get rid of them voluntarily.

The 45-year-old is stable but remains in a coma at the Grenoble hospital as he fights the effects of a serious head injury. Schumacher is a formidable figure in F1, winning a record seven world titles, and his plight has attracted global interest and an outpouring of support from the sport's fans. However his family wants the media to keep their distance. \"Please support us in our common fight with Michael,\" Corinna Schumacher, wife of the F1 racer, said in a statement. \"It is important to me that you [media] relieve the doctors and the hospital so that they can work in peace. \"I kindly ask you to trust their statements and leave the clinic. Please also let our family in peace.\" Schumacher suffered severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on 29 December. The German hit a rock hidden under deep snow and was catapulted head first onto another rock. He was not moving fast at the time. He is in a medically induced coma and has undergone two operations. His condition has attracted intense media scrutiny and last week a journalist disguised as a priest tried to sneak into the French hospital room where the Formula One superstar is being treated. The doctors at the hospital have also called for the media to provide more respect. \"The privacy of the patient demands that we are not going into details of his treatment, and this is why we do not plan any press conferences, nor give out written press releases, anymore for the time being,\" they said in a statement on Monday . \"We again insistently ask you to respect the medical secrets and to stick to the information given by the medical team in charge of the patient or his management, as this is the only valid information. \"The clinical state of Michael Schumacher is considered as stable and is constantly monitored by the medical treatments that are administered to him. \"However, the medical team responsible underlines that they will not stop to consider Michael's condition as critical.\" Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm added: \"I can confirm Michael's condition can be considered as stable, as written in the official statement. I cannot confirm to have stated that his life is out of danger.\" French prosecutors will reportedly brief journalists on their investigation into Schumacher's accident on Wednesday in the Alpine town of Albertville.

Reports of casualties and damage were not immediately available, security officials said. Mohamud Shiekh, a witness near the national theater, said that at least one mortar landed near presidential palace. \"It was really scary. It's reminiscent of the 2010 chaos,\" he said.

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Seventy days after his sudden death, Michael Jackson will be interred in what may or may not be his final resting place Thursday evening. A private funeral for Michael Jackson will be held Thursday in Glendale, California, his family says. Only his family and closest friends will attend the private burial starting at 7 p.m. PT (10 p.m. ET) inside the ornate Great Mausoleum on the grounds of Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California. They'll then drive to an Italian restaurant eight miles away in Pasadena, California for \"a time of celebration,\" the nine-page engraved invitation said. The first page inside the invitation holds a quote from \"Dancing the Dream,\" a book of essays and poems published by Jackson in 1992: . \"If you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same, then everything that happens in between can be dealt with.\"  Gallery: Invitation for Jackson's service \u00bb . The news media -- which have closely covered every aspect of Jackson's death -- will be kept at a distance, with their cameras no closer than the cemetery's main gate. The family will provide a limited video feed that will only show mourners arriving. Little is known about the planned ceremony, though CNN has confirmed that singer Gladys Knight -- a longtime friend to Jackson -- will perform. Her song has not been disclosed. The massive mausoleum, which is normally open to tourists, was closed Wednesday as preparations were completed for the funeral. A security guard blocking its entrance said it would reopen to the public on Friday. Fans of Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and dozens of other celebrities buried on the grounds have flocked to Forest Lawn-Glendale for decades, but Jackson may outdraw them all. It is unclear how close tourists will be allowed to Jackson's resting place. Security guards -- aided by cameras -- keep a constant vigil over the graves and crypts, which are surrounded by a world-class collection of art and architecture. The Forest Lawn Web site boasts that the mausoleum, which draws its architectural inspiration from the Campo Santo in Italy, \"has been called the \"New World's Westminster Abbey\" by Time Magazine. Visitors will see \"exact replicas of Michelangelo's greatest works such as David, Moses, and La Pieta\" and \"Leonardo da Vinci's immortal Last Supper re-created in brilliant stained glass; two of the world's largest paintings,\" the Web site says. Jackson's burial has been delayed by division among Jackson family members, though it was matriarch Katherine Jackson who would make the final decision, brother Jermaine Jackson recently told CNN. He preferred to see his youngest brother laid to rest at his former Neverland Ranch home, north of Los Angeles in Santa Barbara County, California. That idea was complicated by neighbors who vowed to oppose allowing a grave in the rural area -- and by Jackson family members who said the singer would not want to return to the home where he faced child molestation charges, of which he was ultimately acquitted. The mystery of where Michael Jackson would be buried became a media obsession in the weeks after his death. After his body was loaded onto a helicopter at UCLA's Ronald Reagan Medical Center hours following his June 25 death, it stayed in the custody of the Los Angeles County coroner for an autopsy. It was only later disclosed that Jackson's corpse was kept in a refrigerated room at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn cemetery until his casket was carried by motorcade to downtown Los Angeles for a public memorial service in the Staples Center arena. Again, speculation about Jackson's whereabouts grew when the media lost track of his casket after his brothers carried it out of sight inside the arena. Though the family has not publicly confirmed where the body was taken, most reports placed it back at the Hollywood Hills Forest Lawn while awaiting his family's decision. Though Thursday's interment may settle one Michael Jackson mystery, a more serious one remains. The coroner announced last week that he had ruled Jackson's death a homicide. A summary of the coroner's report said the anesthetic propofol and the sedative lorazepam were the primary drugs responsible for the singer's death. Los Angeles police detectives have not concluded their criminal investigation and no one has been charged.\n### Response: ", "target": "NEW: Michael Jackson burial to begin at 7 p.m. PT (10 p.m. ET)\nJackson's burial has been delayed by division among Jackson family members .\nCoroner announced last week that he had ruled Jackson's death a homicide .\nNo one has been charged in the pop singer's death .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Although the sources did not know for sure what the payload is, they said there is no reason to doubt that it is a satellite, as indicated by North Korea. Pyongyang has said it will launch the rocket between April 4 and April 8. Pentagon officials worry less about the payload and more about the launch itself, saying that any kind of launch will give the North Koreans valuable information about improving their ballistic missile program.

{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given review.\n### Input:London, England (CNN) -- The launch of the Facebook Home app has reignited the privacy debate over whether the social networking site is becoming too integrated in our lives. Unveiled last week, Home integrates all of the social network's services into the operating system of Android phones. Instead of having to download apps to use Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and Facebook Camera, access to these features is consolidated into Facebook Home, which appears on the user's home screen. Typically for a Facebook launch, it has attracted fierce criticism. CNN contributor Andrew Keen, an expert in the digital economy, said: \"Facebook wants to know everything we do, so they can sell more advertising. It shows that Facebook has absolutely no respect for our privacy.\" \"They are by definition creepy, untrustworthy and they've proven that time and time again,\" he added. Facebook has responded to the criticism following the launch in a blog post to say that the data Home would collect is no different from what the social networking site already tracks and that it is used internally to improve the user experience. For tech-savvy digital natives, who share personal information frequently and tend to see value in such personal disclosures, the polemic around Home could be seen as a non-issue. It also could be argued that privacy is a long-dead illusion that is fast becoming an outdated concept. David Rowan, editor of technology magazine \"Wired,\" thinks so. \"Our concept of privacy is very much a 20th century idea,\" he told CNN at Names not Numbers, an idea-sharing and networking conference held in the UK recently. \"All that personal data you are giving to these private companies they are making money on and they decide how it's going to be used. You lose control of that data.\" Commentators say that we should be asking tougher questions about that information is being used. Read more: Using social media to predict the future . In his upcoming book \"Who Owns the Future?\" digital pioneer Jaron Lanier discusses how the world's biggest online services such as Google and Facebook are not in fact \"free\" because in return we are duly handing over information about ourselves that can be turned into big money. Read more: 5 tips for controlling your privacy online . But can we really move beyond privacy? Keen thinks that if we don't act soon, we could. In his latest book, \"Digital Vertigo\", he argues that in California's Silicon Valley there are people who \"have already discarded privacy as if it's like gas lighting -- an archaic thing which humans will move beyond.\" Keen urges us to consider what privacy really means in the \"Big Data Age.\" Read more: Privacy was good while it lasted . He talks in apocalyptic terms about a \"scary, nightmarish, dystopian future,\" where we live in a world of \"radical transparency\". Technology seems to be moving ever closer to a world where every aspect of our existence is recorded, both at our will and not, and Keen argues that humans are not ready for this, this ability \"to press the rewind button on your life\". \"The internet needs to learn how to forget. All it knows is how to remember. That's not very human,\" he says, arguing that forgetting is as essential to the human condition as remembering. But, in today's world, the documentation of our every move and every desire is becoming increasingly inescapable. According to Rowan, \"anybody who is using any kind of electronic device is giving up the practical ability to be untrackable.\" So pervasive is the power of internet giants that the U.S. government launched an official \"National Data Privacy Day\" -- a drive to raise awareness among teenagers and young adults about the importance of maintaining what little privacy they may have left. Keen draws similarities between the negative impacts of the industrial revolution and those of the digital world order, which, he says, \"is in some ways more profound and far-reaching\". Just as \"the downside of industrialization was pollution, data distribution and the invasion of our privacy is the pollution of the big data age.\" Monique Rivalland contributed to this report .\n### Response:", "target": "Sharing personal information online has become the norm .\nEditor of \"Wired\" David Rowan thinks privacy has become a \"20th century idea\"\nExperts worried we don't know implications of how our data is being used online .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction: What's the main idea?Buenos Aires (CNN) -- A medical group in Argentina is asking for more drug-testing regulations in the South American country after a officials fined pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline for alleged irregularities in a pediatric pneumonia vaccine trial. The Argentinian Federation of Health Professionals accuses drug maker GlaxoSmithKline of misleading participants and pressuring poor families into joining a trial for the Synflorix vaccine, which the company says protects against bacterial pneumonia and meningitis. \"They recruited children in an irregular manner. ... They did not do what they were supposed to. They did not inform. There were not independent witnesses. They pressured the mothers of poor children,\" said Jorge Yabkowsky, the federation's director. But GlaxoSmithKline, the world's second largest pharmaceutical company, denies those accusations and says it will appeal a judge's approval of Argentina's National Administration of Medicine, Food and Medical Technology's fining the company and two doctors a total of nearly $240,000 for irregularities in documentation of the trial. In a statement, GlaxoSmithKline said it conducts clinical studies all over the world, respecting laws and meeting the highest standards of ethics and quality. \"The ruling has to do with procedures, with the form of documenting procedures of the studies. ... None of the patients that were included in this study were included without their appropriate consent,\" said Rosana Felice, medical director of Glaxo Argentina. Felice said official investigations by Argentina's drug administration, known as ANMAT, and ethics reviews have not turned up any irregularities in the vaccine's safety. GlaxoSmithKline's statement said there are no cases alleging fraud or corruption in the study. The deaths of 14 children who reportedly died after participating in the trials, have drawn widespread attention in Argentinian media. Their deaths are under investigation, but there has been no evidence linking deaths to the vaccine or irregularities in the studies. Felice said GlaxoSmithKline categorically denies that the vaccine caused the deaths. \"In no case was it related to the administration of the vaccine, and this has been sufficiently demonstrated, proven and evaluated by ANMAT,\" Felice said. But the health professional federation pointed to the children's deaths in its call for increased regulations on drug testing. The trial included 24,000 children, Felice said, including 14,000 children in Argentina and 10,000 others in Colombia and Panama.

{"source": "### Instruction: What are the central ideas presented?\n### Input:(CNN) -- \"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,\" the astronomer Carl Sagan once said. In the case of the extraordinary claim concerning the possible discovery of the wreck of Santa Maria, the flagship of Columbus' fleet, it's clear that we aren't there yet. In fact, we seem to be getting further away from proof all the time. The potential discovery of the wreck, which happened on the first of Columbus' four voyages to the Americas, has become a flashpoint for the difficulties of determining the authenticity of artifacts honored in memory but difficult to locate in the present. The discoverer, underwater explorer Barry Clifford, says he has quite a few reasons to believe he's found the right ship in the Caribbean Sea. Columbus left details in his diary about the location of the sinking, which happened near Haiti on Christmas Day in 1492. Clifford maintains that description matches the shipwreck's whereabouts. 500-year-old mystery solved? As the author of \"Columbus: The Four Voyages,\" which surveys the explorer's career, I was naturally drawn to this remarkable find -- if that's what it is. Love him or hate him, Columbus made a difference. No one doubts that he led some of the most important voyages of discovery ever undertaken, and that's why the fate of Santa Maria matters today. The story of this wreck is well-known, and documented by Columbus himself. On Christmas Eve 1492, crew members of all three ships were celebrating, drinking and looking forward to a speedy voyage home to Spain. (The outward-bound trip had taken just 33 days, a testament, in part, to Columbus' navigational genius.) Columbus said he stretched out for a nap at this time. As the fleet traversed the northern coast of what is now Haiti, the ship's master turned over the tiller to a 14-year-old ship's boy, and soon after Santa Maria ran into a reef and began to disintegrate. Columbus managed to rescue everyone -- in fact, he never lost anyone at sea in his eight transatlantic crossings -- and to gather valuable items from the ship before it sank into an estimated 15 to 25 feet of water. That's a summary of what we know, and the wreck should take these factors into consideration to be considered authentic. For starters, Columbus described in his log how the mainmast of the ship was cut away, and, as he wrote, \"she lay on her beam ends. ... The planking opened.\" Any discovery should be consistent with these descriptions, but so far no information about that is forthcoming. And then we also have to account for erosion -- tides and hurricanes -- changing the shoreline and the reef over half a millennium. It's entirely possible, indeed, likely that reefs encountered by Santa Maria have shifted significantly over time, altering or moving the wreck. Next, there's the evidence in Columbus' own hand: his map of the coastline where the ship supposedly sank. Again, it represents how things looked to him 500 years ago rather than in the present. And, most frustrating of all, perhaps, Columbus occasionally fudged his navigational records. Why? To prevent others from exploiting his discoveries. Finally, it's unlikely that any of the wooden parts of the ship have survived after all these years. Other ships have sailed through those same waters over the years, and perhaps collided with the reefs. How to tell one ancient wreck from another? All of these factors make finding Santa Maria difficult. How can a shipwreck hunter make his claims stick? Clifford has pointed to \"ballast\" in the form of stones from the ship as evidence to identify Santa Maria. But ships in those days probably didn't have stone ballast to steady them; heavy cargo such as wine casks served the same function. And then there's the intriguing \"smoking gun,\" as Clifford calls it, the lombard, or cannon, aboard Santa Maria. Just before his presentation at the Explorers Club in New York in 2006, Clifford discovered that these items were missing from the site, \"looted,\" he explained. That's frustrating, especially because back in 2003, he was aware of the wreck and its probable lombards, if that's what they were, and he was touting a visit to the site as part of an auction held by the Explorers Club. But now the lombards, if that's what they were, are gone. There's not much left to go on. Exploration is all about finding something unknown, which often means shaking things up, disproving rather than confirming to arrive at something new. Since 2006, it seems that little was done to secure or explore the site, and given its potential importance, I wonder why that is. Given its potential historic significance, let's hope this wreck will finally receive the careful and responsible attention it deserves.\n### Response: ", "target": "Explorer says he found wreck of Santa Maria, flagship of Columbus' fleet, off Haiti .\nLaurence Bergreen believes discovery is highly unlikely, given erosion, shifts, tides .\nBergreen:The wooden parts of the ship probably have not survived 500 years .\nBergreen: Given potential historic significance, this wreck needs careful examination .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you briefly describe the text?\n### Input:London (CNN) -- A Nepalese army colonel will appear in a British court Saturday to face torture charges linked to his alleged actions during his country's civil war, authorities said . Kumar Lama, 46, is accused of two counts of torture at an army barracks in the Nepalese Kapilvastu. He is accused of intentionally inflicting severe pain or suffering, according to London's Metropolitan Police. The alleged offenses occurred between April and October, 2005. Lama is serving as a military observer under the U.N. Mission in Southern Sudan and was on vacation in Britain, Nepalese state media said. His appearance at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London comes two days after his arrest at a property in St. Leonard's-on-Sea, on England's south coast. Officers from the Metropolitan Police's counter terrorism squad searched his home. The investigation into the torture allegations is being led by the squad, which also investigates alleged war crimes and human rights abuses. Lama was arrested under Britain's 1988 Criminal Justice Act, which allows it to meet its obligations under the U.N. Convention Against Torture to prosecute anyone on its territory responsible for torture anywhere in the world. Nepal summoned the British ambassador in Kathmandu on Friday to protest against the arrest, according to state-run Nepal Television. The government demanded the officer's immediate release, the broadcaster cited Deputy Prime Minister Narayankaji Shrestha as saying. The Nepalese embassy in London has also been told to lodge a protest with the British government, it said. Nepal's government is committed to ensuring justice, compensation and the human rights of torture victims, Shrestha is quoted as saying. From the mid-1990s, Maoist rebels in Nepal fought a 10-year civil war to end the country's autocratic rule by the monarchy. More than 13,000 people died in the fighting. The rebels signed a peace deal with the government in 2006, joined mainstream politics and won the most seats in a 2008 election for the Constituent Assembly. The victory transformed Nepal from a monarchy to a republic after 239 years of autocratic rule. However, international rights group Human Rights Watch has warned of a lack of progress on accountability for violations since the political process stalled in 2011. The group's Asia director, Brad Adams, welcomed Lama's arrest Thursday, saying it was \"an important step in enforcing the U.N. Convention against Torture. Those responsible for committing torture in Nepal can no longer assume they are beyond the reach of the law in other countries. \"The lesson for the Nepal government and army is that it is time to end the culture of impunity that has left victims waiting for justice for far too long,\" he said. Nepal has failed to prosecute anyone for torture committed during the civil war in the nearly seven years since it ended, the Human Rights Watch statement said. Political disputes continue to plague Nepal, which failed to agree on a new constitution by a May deadline and has yet to hold new elections. In December, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was deeply concerned about the continuing political deadlock in Nepal. He urged the country's political parties to resolve their differences and form a broad-based government. The U.N. said that despite the remaining challenges, there have been important achievements since the end of the civil war, including the integration of former Maoist rebels and removal of minefields.\n### Response:", "target": "NEW: Nepal has protested Kumar Lama's arrest, says it is committed to human rights .\nHe is accused of torturing two people at an army barracks in Nepal .\nThe alleged torture occurred during Nepal's civil war, which ended in 2006 .\nHuman Rights Watch says a culture of impunity for rights abuses in Nepal must end .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Kelly Evans started as an economics reporter at the paper as the economy started getting bad a year and a half ago. She has since seen the resilience of the people in her generation as they adapt to a changing job market. CNN's Nicole Lapin talked to Evans about what young people should be doing to deal with the tough times. The following is an edited transcript of the interview: . Nicole Lapin: What do you tell young people to make economic news relevant to them?  Watch the entire interview with Kelly Evans \u00bb . Kelly Evans: We really, really do try to explain to people, past some of the language and the jargon, to say that economics is really about what's happening: your job, your income, demographics, poverty rates, and what it looks like across the country. There are some terms that may seem unfamiliar, but I think if you sit down and read through our coverage, you'll see that a lot of it makes sense. I feel very proud of the fact that over the last year, year and a half, a lot of the articles that I've written and a lot of the articles that we've written as an economics team have done a lot to point out the risks out there so that this didn't just come out of nowhere. Lapin: So what are some of the things that young people should really focus on? Is it a 401(k)? Is it savings? Is it a combination of the two, perhaps? Evans: Well, I think for most young people, the big thing right now is a career or a job path. Whether you're in high school or you're in college, you're thinking, \"What am I going to do when I get out? Do I want to be a doctor, or a lawyer?\" I think less people want to be in banking than did a few years ago, and so I'm curious as a reporter what is perceived to be the golden ticket nowadays. Certainly health care, education are some of the more reliable places to go right now. So what I would say mostly is make sure you're in a good financial position. Do whatever you can for yourself. But really make sure you're investing in your education or skills, maybe the language skills in particular, that will be really important down the road. I think that ends up paying off in human capital. It's really important. Lapin: What kind of tips do you give to youngsters who are about to get out of school?

{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.\n### Input:(CNN) -- Drug cartels, whether in Colombia or Mexico, cannot function without massive assistance from compromised officials at all levels. Corruption is the oxygen that keeps organized crime alive. I know something about corruption and organized crime. I spent more than six years in the biggest, richest syndicate in the history of crime -- the Cali cartel. And I know that Mexico, like Colombia, can't succeed against its drug gangs without choking off much of the bribery and intimidation that sustain them. First, some background: I used to be Jorge Salcedo. I left my name in Colombia when I entered the U.S. witness protection program 16 years ago. I also left a home, a country, friends, family, even my past. But maybe my experience will help show the importance of fighting corruption as a way to fight the cartels. My primary job in the Cali cartel was security for one of four godfathers, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, the daily operations boss. Others were more directly involved in routine bribery, but I still managed to deliver nearly a million dollars in payoffs. And I witnessed many, many millions more. The biggest bribe I ever handled personally was a half-million-dollar payoff to a Salvadoran air force colonel. I was buying four U.S.-made bombs -- 500-pounders -- that the bosses wanted to drop on Pablo Escobar. It was a very bad idea, but they sent me anyway. The cash was disguised as a birthday present, about the size of a large shoebox, wrapped in red paper with gold trim. I'd never seen so much money. I remember that it was surprisingly heavy. Then there were the two checks signed by Miguel worth about $50,000. As instructed, I took those to a bank near the Cali airport and deposited one into the account of a sister and the other to the mother of a captain in the Colombian anti-narcotics task force. It was a bonus for the captain's help getting the boss away from a police raid. In those days, hundreds of high-ranking and lower level police were on the cartel's secret payroll -- tens of thousands of dollars paid every month for inside tips or for looking the other way. The youngest boss, Pacho Herrera, sometimes liked to use local police as sentries at his home. The cartel had important friends in the military, too -- from helicopter pilots to generals. One well-placed insider was the sergeant and chief of staff to the military commander of the anti-narcotics task force. He cost $20,000 a month. Between sources like the army sergeant, the police captain and others, my bosses and I were kept informed about dates, times and places for raids and such things as which cartel cars were being followed and what phone numbers were being tapped. On one occasion, we knew that Miguel had time for lunch and a shower before the raiding party was scheduled to arrive. Both the sergeant and the captain were among hundreds of police and military officers fired for corruption. Besides law enforcement, the cartel bought a piece of Colombia's justice system with payoffs to prosecutors who lost evidence, misplaced paperwork, blocked search warrants or released prisoners before they could be questioned. Some judges became overnight millionaires. I see police and judicial corruption as the biggest price of organized crime. Politicians were considered a long-term investment. It seemed sometimes that they all had their hands out. The bosses handed out $20,000 checks like hospitality gifts. I was there when campaign officials for a presidential candidate came for help. Eventually, a total of $6 million in secret donations made Ernesto Samper our president. After top campaign aides acknowledged receiving cartel funds, Samper insisted that if such contributions were made, it was without his knowledge. And I was there when Cali cartel lawyers were allowed to rewrite our national constitution to outlaw extraditions of Colombian traffickers to the United States. You may be skeptical when I tell you, but no true Colombian could have watched that spectacle of democracy for sale without suffering some heartache. When I agreed to assist U.S. drug enforcement agents 16 years ago, the Cali cartel was making $7 billion a year. Cartel documents turned over to Colombian authorities exposed a vast network of corruption. There was public outrage. Widespread arrests and firings followed, and the grip of corruption was broken. That's what brought down the Cali cartel, and it can make a difference in other countries where a culture of acceptance makes corruption especially stubborn. The Mexican public needs to express its outrage. And, then, Mexican leaders need to sweep out officials at all levels who have sold their souls to organized crime.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you outline the content?\n### Input: (CNN) -- Dubai is home to the tallest building, largest mall and biggest candy shop. Recently, however, the city proved that its penchant for the extra large isn't limited to the inanimate. Last week, the Dubai Mall became home to a giant pacific octopus -- the largest species of octopus on the planet. The newest occupant, who lives at the mall's Dubai Aquarium & Underwater Zoo, stretches out to a fear-inducing 14 feet, and weighs over 70 kilograms (154 pounds). Earlier this month, the aquarium announced it had acquired one of the largest known reptiles on the planet, a 1,600-pound crocodile they've dubbed King Croc (they also flew in his companion, Queen Croc). John Gerner, a theme park consultant and the managing director at Leisure Business Advisors, notes that the mall's current preoccupation with large animals is consistent with the Emirate's obsession with record-breaking pursuits. \"In a general, entertainment attractions have always been a way for countries to have bragging rights in the world. By having the best, the biggest and the fastest of everything, Dubai wants to show they've arrived on the world stage. In many ways, having record-breaking animals is another way to do that,\" he says. The country is no stranger to peppering its entertainment offerings with animals exotic to the region. In 2012, Ski Dubai -- the indoor ski slope housed at Mall of the Emirates -- welcomed a colony of King and Gentoo penguins. In 2008, Atlantis, The Palm hotel courted controversy from animal rights groups when it hosted a whale shark in its in-built aquarium. \"Lately, you're seeing attractions where you wouldn't typically find animals adding them in. It's a merging of concepts. At Atlantis, you have a lodging using an animal attraction as an amenity to justify higher room rates and occupancy,\" explains Gerner. It's a concept that doesn't sit well with local animal rights groups. \"In the wild, crocodiles spent hours swimming and can regulate the buoyancy and temperature or their bodies. No enclosure -- no matter how large -- is able to provide crocodiles with everything that is natural and important to them,\" says Ashley Fruno, the Asia and Middle East senior campaigner for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). \"If the Dubai Mall wants to set itself apart from the rest, there are other ways to do that than imprisoning wild animals in concrete enclosures and taking away everything that is natural and important to them,\" she adds. In a statement, Emaar, the developers for The Dubai Mall, note that King Croc and his companion were obtained from a crocodile farm in Australia. They add that the transfer was facilitated in partnership with Australian government authorities, who reviewed the quality of the display, qualifications of the staff caring for the animals and the educational purpose of the exhibit. Emaar also notes that the habitat made for the two crocodiles is three times the size specified by the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The country's fascination with wild animals isn't always limited to the indoors. Last year the UAE's Ministry of Environment and Water issued bans on the commercial and personal import of a variety of exotic animals -- including many big cats and primates -- yet they remain popular pets for many Emiratis, who see them as a status symbol. Several locals have shot to Instagram fame showcasing their exotic animal collection. \"Unfortunately, the trade in exotic animals is largely unregulated and statistics are very difficult to come by,\" says Fruno. \"The animals pay the price for this trade. Many don't survive the journey from their homes in the wild, and those that do often die prematurely from malnutrition, an unnatural environment, loneliness and the overwhelming stress of confinement.\" Still, she does note that animal rights -- though a newer concept in the UAE -- is on the rise. \"Awareness is growing by the day, and new animal welfare groups are popping up in the region all the time,\" she says.\n### Response :", "target": "The Dubai Mall recently acquired a giant squid and two crocodiles .\nAnimals in malls are not uncommon.

The 26-year-old recorded a 37th consecutive victory at Barcelona with a 6-3 6-0 quarterfinal win over fellow Spaniard Albert Ramos just hours after finishing off his rain-delayed third round match. After returning from a seven-month injury enforced absence with a knee problem in February, Nadal has reached six finals in six tournaments this year. Bad weather in Barcelona Thursday forced the World No.5 to complete his match against Frenchman Benoit Paire on Friday morning. A 7-6 6-2 win set up a last eight clash with Ramos, who Nadal swept aside in just 66 minutes following a commanding display. \"I played much better this afternoon than in the morning,\" Nadal told the ATP website. \"I'm very happy to be in the semifinals another time in a very important tournament. \"I'm enjoying the week playing here. I love the tournament. I know everybody well. It feels like home, always.\" Nadal, who lost out in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters to Novak Djokovic last week, is hoping to secure an eighth French Open title next month. The Spaniard had hoped to win a ninth consecutive title at Monte Carlo before suffering his first defeat at the clay court tournament since 2003. He will now hope to bounce back with Canada's Milos Raonic standing in between him and a place in Sunday's final. Raonic, who has lost both of his previous encounters with Nadal, overcame Tommy Robredo 6-7 6-3 7-6. In the other semifinal, Spain's Nicolas Almagro will face Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber. Almagro, ranked 12th in the world, defeated compatriot Juan Monaco 6-3 7-5 in a contest where he saved 10 break points. \"He had many break points and played really good, but I can rest now for a little bit and we'll see what comes tomorrow in the semi-finals,\" Almagro told the official ATP website. \"I played really good today and that's the most important thing. I've felt great during this week and I'm going to fight to reach my first final here in Barcelona.\" Kohlschreiber, seeded eighth, saw off Slovakia's Martin Klizan in three sets before his quarterfinal opponent, Thomaz Bellucci, withdrew injured. Meanwhile, Juan Martin del Potro has withdrawn from next week's Lisbon Open. According to the tournament's organizers, the Argentine, ranked seventh in the world, has been suffering with a stomach virus. In Stuttgart, defending champion Maria Sharapova overcame Serbia's Ana Ivanovic in 7-5 4-6 6-4 to ensure her place in the last four. \"It's good to face different styles of playing from different opponents,\" Sharapova told reporters. \"Ana is a bit more aggressive, while Lucie Safarova had a bit more variety in her game yesterday. \"I am happy to get through, but I had to push myself. \"It was a tough battle, it was hard to get my body going again after the last game, but it was good to get another three sets under the belt.\" The World No.2 will face Germany's Angelique Kerber on Saturday after the home favorite saw off Kazakhstan's Yaroslava Shvedova 6-3 7-6. \"We both played well,\" Kerber told the WTA website. \"I was fully concentrated right from the first point and tried to make her move around and not let her get into the match -- luckily enough my tactics worked well today. \"It was extremely important for me to play as well as possible at my home tournament. \"Reaching the semifinals is a big achievement for me.

The World No.5 was beaten in three sets by Mattek-Sands in their previous meeting at the quarterfinal stage of the 2011 Madrid Open and is expecting another tough test. \"I saw Bethanie play earlier on and she looks like a good, aggressive, player,\" Li told reporters. \"We'll see how tomorrow's match goes.\"\n### Response:", "target": "Rafael Nadal through to the semifinals at Barcelona Open .\nRain-delay forced Nadal to play conclusion of quarterfinal tie Friday .\nWorld No.5 will face Milos Raonic in last four .\nSpain's Nicolas Almagro to play Philipp Kohlschreiber in other semifinal .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Produce an article summary of the following news article:Doc to summarize:\n### Input: Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani police have revised the cause of a blast that killed 83 people on Saturday, saying a suicide bomber was behind the attack that pulverized a busy marketplace. The explosion targeted Shiite Muslims in Hazara, on the outskirts of the southwestern city of Quetta, authorities said. Police now say a suicide bomber, driving an explosive-laden water tanker, rammed the vehicle into buildings at the crowded marketplace. The water tanker carried between 800 and 1,000 kilograms (1,760 to 2,200 pounds) of explosive material, Quetta police official Wazir Khan Nasir said. Previously, police said explosives were packed in a parked water tanker and were remotely detonated. The blast demolished four buildings of the marketplace, leaving dozens dead and 180 injured. The banned Sunni militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the attack, spokesman Abu Bakar Sadeeq told CNN Sunday. The assault left some wondering what could stop the bloodshed in Quetta. Zulfiqar Ali Magsi, the governor and chief executive of Balochistan province, told reporters Saturday that law enforcement agencies were incapable of stopping such attacks and had failed to maintain law and order in Quetta. Pakistan, which is overwhelmingly Sunni, has been plagued by sectarian strife and attacks for years. Last month, two deadly suicide bombings in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood of Quetta known as Alamdar Road killed 85 Shiite Muslims. Police described that double bombing as one of the worst attacks on the Shiite minority. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi also claimed responsibility for that dual attack. According to its interpretation of Islam, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi believes that Shiites are not Muslims. The group believes Shiites insult close companions of Muslim's prophet Muhammad. Therefore, the militant group believes killing Shiites is a justified in Islam. Families of victims from Alamdar Road protested for several days by laying their relatives' bodies on a road in Quetta until the federal government dissolved the provincial government and imposed governor rule. Although Balochistan is the largest Pakistani province in Pakistan, analysts and some locals have criticized the federal government for neglecting it, leading to instability. The Shiite community has repeatedly asked for more protection but to no avail. During the Alamdar Road protest, Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf met with Shiites in Quetta, Pakistani media reported. He agreed to toss out the provincial government and putting a governor in charge. All administrative powers of the provincial government were given to the governor, who deployed paramilitary forces to maintain law and order in Quetta.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?\n### Input:(CNN) -- A male suicide bomber dressed in women's clothing killed three members of Somalia's U.N.-backed interim government and 16 others Thursday when he detonated at a medical school graduation ceremony in Mogadishu, government officials and witnesses said. The Transitional Federal Government said Education Minister Abdullahi Wayel, Health Minister Qamar Aden and Higher Education Minister Ibrahim Hassan Adow were among the dead after the bomber attacked Banadir University's medical school commencement. The African Union, which leads a peacekeeping mission in Somalia, put the death toll at 19. The victims also included nine students and two doctors, according to a professor at Banadir University, while journalists said two of their colleagues died in the blast. In addition, Sports Minister Suleman Olad Roble was hospitalized in critical condition, his relatives told local media. Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed blamed the Islamist rebel group Al-Shabaab for the attack and displayed what he said was the body of the bomber for reporters, a local journalist who attended the news conference told CNN. The body the president displayed had a beard. The president also showed the remains of the suicide belt and shreds of a hijab -- a garment worn by some Muslim women to reflect modesty -- at the news conference, according to the journalist, whom CNN is not naming for security reasons. At the United Nations, the Security Council condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism against \"people dedicated to building a peaceful, stable and prosperous future for the people of Somalia.\" It urged a \"thorough investigation\" and expressed hope that those responsible would \"be brought swiftly to justice.\" \"The Security Council expresses its deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of those killed and to those injured in the attack, as well as to the Transitional Federal Government and the people of Somalia,\" the council's current president, Burkina Faso's U.N. Ambassador Michel Kafando, said Thursday. Video of the graduation ceremony showed Dr. Osman Dufle, the country's former health minister, speaking as the camera begins to shake -- apparently from the explosion. Afterward, Dufle told journalists that he saw a person dressed in black moving through the audience just before the blast, according to the Radio Mogadishu journalist. Al-Shabaab is made up of former allies of Ahmed, once a leader of the Islamist movement that briefly held power in Mogadishu in 2006. Adow, a Somali-American, served as the foreign secretary of the Islamic Courts Union when it held Mogadishu. But while Ahmed and other former members of the ICU accepted a U.N.-brokered peace agreement with the government they once fought, Al-Shabaab -- which the United States says has links to al Qaeda -- has rejected the peace agreement and has waged a bloody campaign against the transitional government. The African Union's peacekeeping mission AMISOM condemned Thursday's attack. It vowed to \"spare no efforts to ensure that the perpetrators of this act and such heinous crimes against humanity being carried out in Somalia\" will be brought to justice. The journalists killed were Mohamed Amiin Abdullah of Shabelle Media Network and freelance cameraman Hassan Ahmed Hagi, who worked closely with the network. CNN regularly works with Shabelle Media. The African Union condemned the attack, saying it would \"spare no efforts to ensure that perpetrators of this act and such heinous crimes against humanity being carried out in Somalia\" will be brought to justice. The National Union of Somali Journalists also condemned the attack and said it brought the number of journalists killed in the country this year to eight.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Authorities do not plan to file charges against a Florida orange grove owner who fatally shot a 21-year-old woman, saying he is protected under the state's controversial \"no retreat\" law. Bullet holes pocked the windshield of the crashed SUV, and blood stained he passenger seat. But the woman's boyfriend faces second-degree murder charges in her death, because the woman was shot to death during an alleged felony -- the theft of an SUV. Tony Curtis Phillips, 29, didn't fire a single shot. He didn't even know his girlfriend, Nikki McCormick, was dead until police showed him an online news story. Police said McCormick accompanied Phillips as he attempted to steal the SUV from a barn in an orange grove near Wahneta, Florida, before daylight Tuesday. Grove owner Ladon \"Jamie\" Jones opened fire as the SUV approached him, according to an affidavit released by the Polk County Sheriff's Office. Phillips fled; McCormick was shot in the head and later died. Authorities said Jones is protected by Florida's \"no retreat\" law, which gives him the right to use lethal force if he reasonably believes his life is in danger. Phillips, however, faces charges because police allege he was committing felony grand theft auto at the time of McCormick's death. \"Because his conduct caused her death, he gets charged with a felony,\" Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said. Phillips was arrested late Tuesday in Polk County, near Lakeland, after a day on the run. Police said he didn't believe McCormick was dead at first, telling officers, \"Of all the times you've questioned me, this is a nasty trick you're playing on me this time.\" He agreed to cooperate if detectives could prove she was dead. Judd said detectives called up the shooting story on the local newspaper's Web site and \"let him read it online, and that's when he broke down and cried, and gave us a confession,\" Judd said. According to the affidavit, Jones heard his Toyota Land Cruiser, parked in the barn at his orange grove, start up before daylight Tuesday. Jones told police he grabbed his gun, a 9mm that he keeps with him while working at the grove. He said he could see two people in the SUV as it backed out of the barn, according to the affidavit. He said he saw the passenger's arm reach outside the vehicle, and believed that person might be holding a gun. The Land Cruiser stopped directly in front of him, Jones said in the affidavit. He said he raised his gun and pointed it at the occupants, shouting \"Stop,\" but the vehicle appeared to be moving directly toward him. \"Fearing for his life, he then fired what he thought to be six to eight rounds into the front windshield of the vehicle,\" the affidavit stated. The vehicle backed up at high speed, crashed through a fence and ended up in a ditch. Jones told police a man jumped out of the SUV and ran away. Sheriff's deputies found McCormick inside the vehicle with a bullet wound to her head. She was taken to Lakeland Regional Medical Center, where she died. Jones did not return a call from CNN seeking comment. Authorities will forward their information to prosecutors, Judd said, but are \"not going to file any charges [against Jones] at this point, because we don't see any reason to arrest Mr. Jones,\" Judd said. \"... It appears, at this point in the investigation, Mr. Jones was completely, legally justified in his actions.\" A Polk County judge on Thursday ordered Phillips held without bond. A public defender was appointed to his case. Polk County Public Defender J. Marion Moorman declined to comment on the charges to CNN. \"We will, of course, be interviewing the client very soon, and will be undertaking his defense from there,\" he said. Phillips told police he assumed McCormick had also gotten out of the vehicle and run away, according to the affidavit. He said he was sorry for what happened \"and said he knew he was partially responsible for her death,\" the affidavit said. Polk County State Attorney's Office spokesman Chip Thulberry said his office will review the case when the sheriff's investigation is completed. The Brady Campaign to prevent Gun Violence says Florida is one of 16 states that have enacted \"no retreat\" laws, which some call \"shoot-first\" laws. The laws extend the right to use deadly force beyond a person's home and into public places. \"The shoot-first law is not needed,\" said Brian Malte of the Brady Campaign. \"This person, regardless of the situation, may have done the right thing, but he cannot be prosecuted for doing something wrong if he hit an innocent bystander,\" he said. Other groups stand by the \"no retreat\" laws. \"At the moment a crime occurs, victims don't have the luxury of time,\" said Andrew Arulanandam of the National Rifle Association. \"They have seconds to decide on a course of action to protect their lives and their families.

{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.\n### Input: LONDON, England (CNN) -- Central London fell silent save for the tolling of Big Ben as the United Kingdom honored the dead of wars past and present on Remembrance Sunday. Queen Elizabeth II then laid a wreath at the Cenotaph, the war memorial on Whitehall near Parliament, after a military band played the \"Last Post.\" Other members of the royal family, including her husband, Prince Philip, and grandchildren Princes Harry and William, followed suit under steel-gray skies as Britain marked a tradition going back to the end of World War I. Harry was representing his father Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, who is in Canada. Hours before the ceremony began, the Ministry of Defence announced the 200th British soldier had been killed in hostile action in Afghanistan. The soldier, from the 2nd Battalion, The Rifles, was killed in an explosion in Helmand province, the main British area of operations, in southern Afghanistan. That was then followed by the news that another soldier from 4th Battalion, The Rifles, died from injuries sustained in an explosion that happened in the same region near Sangin. Both soldier's families have been informed, the Ministry of Defence said. An American soldier was also killed in an insurgent attack in western Afghanistan, the International Security Assistance Force said in a statement. The event was not related to an ongoing search for two U.S. Army paratroopers, who went missing Wednesday near Afghanistan's border with Turkmenistan, ISAF said. The service member's name was not released. British troops also marked Remembrance Sunday in Afghanistan. The country honors war dead each year on the Sunday closest to November 11, the day World War I ended in 1918. The memorials this year come as many Britons question the country's military mission in Afghanistan. The UK has about 9,000 troops there, the second-largest contingent after the United States. Prime Minister Gordon Brown attempted to shore up support for the eight-year-old mission Friday. \"Our mission must not fail,\" Brown said. \"It is not easy, the choices are not simple, there is no strategy that is without danger and risk, but that is the responsibility of leadership of government and of our armed forces -- to do what is necessary, however difficult, to keep the British people safe. \"We cannot, must not, and will not walk away,\" Brown said. Sunday marked the first Remembrance Sunday since the death of the last two British World War I veterans living in the U.K., Harry Patch and Henry Allingham. Patch, 111, and Allingham, 113, died within a week of each other in July. Brown and other political leaders laid wreaths after the royal family at the Cenotaph, a memorial designed by the eminent early 20th-century architect Edward Lutyens. Diplomats from countries that used to be part of the British Empire followed, as did uniformed and civilian leaders of the British military. Rows of uniformed veterans stood on Whitehall for the service, wearing red paper poppies in their lapels. The Royal British Legion sells the paper poppies every year to raise money for veterans' causes. They are ubiquitous across the country in the weeks leading up to Remembrance Sunday. The ceremony lasted about 20 minutes from the moment of silence at 11 a.m. (6 a.m. ET) through the singing of \"God Save the Queen\" after a short service led by the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres. After the royal family left the memorial, military veterans and members of the public also walked past the Cenotaph.\n### Response : ", "target": "Queen Elizabeth II and Royal family lay wreaths at the Cenotaph, the war memorial near Parliament in London .\nBritain honors its war dead each year on the Sunday closest to November 11, the day World War I ended in 1918 .\nHours before the ceremony began, the 200th British soldier was been killed in hostile action in Afghanistan .\nThat was followed by the news that a U.S. soldier and another British soldier died in separate incidents .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction: How would you distill the main concepts?(CNN) -- A federal immigration board rejected an emergency appeal Friday for a stay of deportation filed by the lawyer for Nazi war crimes suspect John Demjanjuk. John Demjanjuk, shown at his 1993 Israel acquittal, is sought by Germany for alleged killings at a Nazi camp. The decision by the Department of Justice's Board of Immigration Appeals in Falls Church, Virginia, clears the way for Demjanjuk's deportation to Germany, where he is being sought for his alleged involvement during World War II in killings at Sobibor, a Nazi death camp in Poland. The deportation of Demjanjuk would close a chapter in one of the longest-running pursuits of an alleged Holocaust perpetrator in history, while also paving the way for an extraordinary German war crimes trial. Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement are now free to pick up Demjanjuk at any point and take him into custody for transport to Germany, a board official said. The appeals board rejected Demjanjuk's emergency stay request because it concluded \"there is little likelihood of success that his pending motion to re-open the case will be granted,\" according to board officials. The pending motion argues that a deportation of Demjanjuk, 89, to Germany would constitute torture. \"In the four years since his deportation was [initially] ordered, his health has seriously deteriorated,\" Demjanjuk's attorney, John Broadley, told CNN in a recent telephone interview. Broadley said Demjanjuk suffers from pre-leukemia, kidney problems, spinal problems and \"a couple of types of gout.\" The board, however, has already signaled that argument will be rejected. Demjanjuk may make an additional expedited appeal for an emergency stay to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, though his chances of getting the board's ruling overturned are believed to be slim, according to Justice Department officials. Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center found irony in Broadley's argument for his client. \"He wants to plead the sense of fairness that he regularly denied all of the victims at Sobibor,\" Hier said. Hier called Demjanjuk's comparison of his planned deportation to torture \"preposterous coming from a person that served the [Nazi organization] S.S. in a death camp. It is a preposterous argument and insulting to the survivors of the Holocaust.\" Hier said that 250,000 Jews were killed at the camp, and that none of the guards who worked there was blameless. \"You were there for one job: kill the Jews,\" he said. \"And that's what they did full-time.\" He called the evidence against Demjanjuk \"overwhelming.\" German authorities issued an arrest warrant for Demjanjuk on March 10, accusing him of being an accessory to 29,000 counts of murder as a guard at the death camp from March to September 1943. They studied an identification card provided by the U.S. Office of Special Investigations, and concluded it was genuine, before issuing the warrant. Demjanjuk, a retired autoworker living in Cleveland, Ohio, has been fighting charges of Nazi war crimes for more than two decades. He was previously extradited from the United States to Israel, where he was convicted in 1986 of being \"Ivan the Terrible,\" a guard at the notorious Treblinka extermination camp. The conviction was overturned by Israeli courts on appeal, and he returned to the United States. The United States filed new charges against him in 1999, again alleging that he had been a concentration camp guard. He was stripped of U.S. citizenship and has been awaiting deportation since 2005, despite fighting his case all the way to the Supreme Court. Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian, says he fought in the Soviet army and later was a prisoner of war held by the Germans. CNN's Terry Frieden contributed to this report.\n### Response :", "target": "Ukrainian-born John Demjanjuk loses an appeal to avoid deportation .\nGerman authorities seek him for alleged involvement in Nazi camp killings .\nThe retired autoworker denies all allegations .\nDemjanjuk, 89, lives with his wife in Cleveland, Ohio .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Kashmiris watch as Indian trucks cross into the border town of Chakothi in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. To cheers and band music, the first trucks rumbled from the Pakistani side across a white bridge to a brightly decorated trade center festooned . Apple-laden Indian trucks heading the other way were also warmly welcomed. It is hoped the move will ease tensions in the troubled Himalayan region, which has been a conflict flashpoint between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan who both lay claims to the territory. \"Today, we have regained our lost market,\" said Ghulam Rasool Bhat, president of the Kashmir fruit growers' association.

The beginning of the trade between the two Kashmirs will further improve the relations and lead to a peaceful resolution of the bitter problem,\" he said. The trucks were subjected to thorough security checks before they crossed the bridge, one of the few crossing points in the heavily militarized 742-kilometer (460-mile) Line of Control, the de facto frontier that divides the region. Kashmir has been a major source of dispute between India, and Pakistan since the two countries were partitioned at the end of British rule in 1947. Muslim Kashmiris sided with Pakistan to the north, while the Hindu south joined India. For the past 18 years, Kashmir has been wracked by a bloody separatist campaign. Authorities say up to 43,000 people have died, but rights groups and non-governmental organizations put the death toll at twice that. Violence had dropped off since the countries began a peace process in 2004, but it surged after the state government in Indian-controlled Kashmir announced plans in June to donate land for a Hindu shrine. Muslim protests following the decision prompted a government U-turn that triggered Hindu demonstrations calling for it to be restored. Subsequent violence left 40 dead and hundreds wounded. It is hoped Tuesday's route opening will bolster the peace agreement and combat lingering mistrust between India and Pakistan. A bilateral cease-fire has been holding in the region for more than four years. A bus service connecting the divided Kashmir began amid much fanfare in 2005 but struggled under the weight of elaborate security checks and stifling bureaucracy. \"This is a great emotional moment, as it brings to mind my grandfather, who used to drive lorries on this road,\" said Muzhar Hussain Naqvi, who drove the leading Pakistani truck.

Fast-forward to 2013 and it is Vonn's turn to thank the elements as the American has been handed the World Cup downhill crown for a record sixth year in a row -- despite being sidelined with a serious knee injury. She held off Slovenia's Tina Maze by just a single point after bad fog forced the abandonment of the season's final downhill race in Lenzerheide in Switzerland on Wednesday. Vonn wrote on her Facebook page: \"Omg I won the World Cup Downhill title!!!!! 6 in a row with a bum knee! Everything in life comes back around. #believe #karma #onelegvictorydance #sochi2014.\" The Sochi hashtag is a reference to next February's Winter Olympics in Russia, where the 28-year-old hopes to defend her downhill gold from Vancouver 2010. She has now won 17 Crystal Globes -- handed out for the overall title and each of the six disciplines competed for each season. It puts her two short of male skiing legend Ingemar Stenmark, who holds the record of 19. Vonn was airlifted to hospital on the opening day of February's world championships at Schladming, Austria, where she suffered a torn ACL and MCL in her right knee and a lateral tibial plateau fracture after crashing in the super G race. After losing out to Maria Hofl-Riesch by just three points in agonizing circumstances following the cancellation of her race in 2011, Vonn was understandably thrilled with her latest success. It had looked unlikely with overall World Cup champion Maze expected to overturn the one-point deficit, but fog at the bottom section of the racecourse forced a cancellation. Going into the final event, Vonn led the standings with 340 points despite missing the preceding races at Meribel and Garmisch, with Maze right behind her. Hofl-Riesch ended up third and Vonn's U.S. teammate Stacy Cook was fourth. Maze took to Twitter to congratulate Vonn, writing: \"I guess the DH globe belongs to someone else, Congratulation Lindsey! What goes around comes around!\" Vonn overtook Annemarie Moser-Proll, who won five consecutive downhill titles between 1971-75 on her way to seven globes in the discipline. Vonn also eclipsed the Austrian's 16 globes. In the men's World Cup, Aksel Lund Svindal was declared downhill champion after Wednesday's event was called off. The Norwegian, who has now won nine globes during his career, boasted a 58-point advantage over defending champion Klaus Kroll of Austria going into Finals week. Svindal's victory makes him just the seventh man in the sport's history to win the downhill and super-G titles in the same season.\n### Response: ", "target": "Lindsey Vonn wins sixth successive downhill title after final race canceled .\nVonn has been out of action since beginning of February with serious knee injury .\nU.S. star now has 17 Crystal Globes, just two behind Ingemar Stenmark .\nNorway's Aksel Lund Svindal wins men's downhill event .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Tokyo Electric also announced it will decommission reactors Nos. 1-4 at Fukushima Daiichi. It also has canceled plans to build two other reactors at the site. In addition to the company's earnings, Tokyo Electric president Masataka Shimizu announced his resignation Friday, which must be approved by the board of directors at a June meeting. \"The accident compromised our confidence in the safety of nuclear power,\" Shimizu said. \"We have caused problems and anxiety to the public.\" Managing Director Toshio Nishizawa has been tapped to replace the president. \"We are facing the gravest crisis in the history of the company,\" Nishizawa said. \"I feel the enormous gravity of the responsibility to assume the position of the president ... so I accepted the position.\" Vice Presidents Sakae Mutoh and Makio Fujiwara also tendered their resignations, as did Director Tomijirou Morita.

The Fukushima Daiichi plant has faced a series of setbacks since a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami struck on March 11. The disasters triggered a glitch in the plant's cooling system, and caused radiation to leak. As crews work to bring the problems under control, the government said this week it would compensate more than 78,000 displaced by the nuclear disaster. Tokyo Electric has made a down payment on compensation of 1 million yen (about $12,000) per household to some families. Some analysts say total compensation could amount to more than 10 trillion yen ($124 billion). The government has set no ceiling on the compensation and Tokyo Electric will be required to pay back the money spent out of a government-backed fund.

{"source": "### Instruction:Could you highlight the primary messages?London (CNN) -- A notebook full of work-in-progress versions of some of Dylan Thomas's key poems has been rediscovered more than 70 years after the poet's mother-in-law ordered it to be burnt. The book, in Thomas's cramped, neat handwriting, includes 19 poems in varying states of completion, some with large sections scratched out and revised, and offers a valuable insight into his creative process. Hailed as a \"terrific discovery\" by one leading Thomas expert, the workbook is set to sell at auction for upwards of \u00c2\u00a3100,000 ($156,430), capping off the writer's centenary year and tantalizing poetry scholars around the world. Thomas, one of the leading poets of the 20th Century, is thought to have discarded the notebook during a stay at the home of his mother-in-law, Yvonne Macnamara, at some point in the late 1930s. Thomas and Macnamara did not get on, and he wrote to a friend of his dislike for both her and the place -- Blashford in Hampshire -- in southern England. \"This flat English country levels the intelligence, planes down the imagination, narrows the a's, my ears belch up old wax and misremembered passages of misunderstood music, I sit and hate my mother-in-law, glowering at her from corners and grumbling about her in the sad, sticky, quiet of the lavatory.\" Macnamara gave the workbook to her maid, Louie King, and told her to dispose of it, but King opted to save it from the flames, and instead stashed it away for decades. A handwritten note from King on the cover explains: \"This Book of Poetry by Dylan Thomas was with a lot of papers given to me to burn in the kitchen boiler. I saved it and forgot all about it until I read of his death ...\" King died in 1984, and the book has remained among her family's possessions, hidden away in a drawer ever since, and unknown to Thomas scholars who pore over every other scrap of his work. John Goodby, the editor of Thomas's \"Collected Poems,\" said the discovery was \"probably the most significant find since Thomas's death in 1953 when various papers were bought up, and perhaps even since 1941, when he sold some of his notebooks to the University at Buffalo. \"For some of the poems included, we've never had manuscript versions before, and they show significant changes were made; most of them are fair copies of finished poems, but some are more like worksheets -- they allow us to see how he arrived at a certain phrase, to see what he's up to.\" All the works included eventually made it into print, some in his first collection, \"18 Poems,\" in 1934, and the rest in his second anthology, \"25 Poems,\" in 1936, which suggests the manuscript dates to a critical point in his life. \"At this particular period in his career, his works are like abstract paintings or music: everything is about the words, the language -- they're not anecdotes or narratives,\" he explained, adding that Thomas had likely discarded the notebook because all the poems in it had been published: \"He'd used it up. He was always leaving things behind.\" As literature fans in Thomas's native Wales and around the world celebrate the centenary of his birth, the notebook is being put up for sale at Sotheby's auction house in London in December, where it is expected to go under the hammer for between \u00c2\u00a3100,000 and \u00c2\u00a3150,000 ($156,430 to $234,640). Rosie Chester, of Sotheby's, said that as a \"way of understanding Dylan Thomas's writing process\" it was likely to appeal to anyone with a love of his work. \"It will be very exciting to see where it ends up,\" she told CNN. Goodby, professor of English language and literature at the University of Swansea (Thomas's hometown) said major libraries and university collections around the world would love to own the book. \"Personally, I'd like to see the National Library of Wales or the British Library put in a bid, to stop it from leaving the country, if possible,\" he said. The University at Buffalo, New York, and the Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas -- both already home to large Dylan Thomas collections -- may also take an interest, Goodby added. \"From my point of view the worst thing would be for it to end up in the hands of a private collector who locks it up in a bank vault for 50 years,\" he said, admitting he was desperate to get a closer look at the book after being given a sneak peek ahead of the sale. \"It was hard to keep my hands off it -- I just want to pore through it, to be able to read every word in his crabbed, backwards-sloping hand -- it is such a covetable object.\" Dylan Thomas was born in Swansea, south Wales, in 1914; he found fame with his \"play for voices,\" \"Under Milk Wood,\" and poems including \"Fern Hill\" and \"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night.\" Thomas was also known for his hard-drinking lifestyle. He collapsed at New York's Chelsea Hotel in 1953, shortly after reportedly announcing: \"I've had 18 straight whiskies. I think that's the record!\" and died in hospital several days later.\n### Response:", "target": "A long-lost notebook full of poems by Dylan Thomas is to be sold at auction .\nBook was discarded by Thomas and due to be burnt, but was saved by a housemaid .\nManuscript contains working versions of some of the poet's key works .\nSale likely to attract attention, bids, from universities and libraries in UK, U.S.", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Monti will outline his plans Sunday but will not say until afterward whether he plans to run in elections expected to be held February 24, ANSA said, citing \"sources.\" An economist and former European commissioner, Monti was appointed by Napolitano to fill former premier Silvio Berlusconi's place after he resigned last year under pressure for failing to control Italy's debt and a series of scandals. Since then, international investors have displayed confidence in the country's finances. Italy's borrowing costs have fallen this year on Monti's efforts to bring down borrowing and the improved sentiment generated by the European Central Bank's conditional scheme to buy bonds of struggling sovereigns. Berlusconi has criticized Monti's austerity policies as damaging to the country. Berlusconi's party, the People of Freedom, is the largest in Parliament. While Monti's economic reforms have been popular with investors, earning him the nickname \"Super Mario,\" the measures have not pleased the Italian public, although protests have been more muted than in Spain or Greece. Italy is in a recession, and further belt-tightening will be unpopular with its citizens. The unemployment rate in Italy rose to 11.1% in October, marking a 13-year high, and the Italian economy has contracted for five consecutive quarters. As of the third quarter, its economic growth was down 2.4% from a year earlier. However, investors have welcomed Monti's effort to cut down on the nation's debt, and Italy's borrowing costs have fallen dramatically since the country made economic changes. After drifting above 7% a year ago, the yield on Italy's 10-year government bond has fallen to about 4.5% recently. Monti's term was originally set to expire in mid-2013, but his earlier departure is expected to bring elections forward. Elections must be held within 70 days of the dissolution of Parliament.

Patriotism is about defending America's moral character and celebrating what makes this country great. Unfortunately, this bad law did the exact opposite. I was an adviser to Sen.

Our report, Losing Liberty: The State of Freedom Ten Years After the Patriot Act\" found, and the ACLU has also reported, that the FBI targeted entire communities, specifically Muslims, Arabs, South Asians and Middle Easterners, sowing fear and mistrust among all Americans. So where are we 10 years later? Today, the FBI can show up at your work, unannounced, to interrogate you about an article on political events you post on Facebook, or seize information about your phone calls, e-mails, internet activity and medical and banking records -- all without a shred of evidence that you've engaged in criminal activity. Government agents can stop and interrogate you at the border as you seek to re-enter the United States, asking questions like \"Do you pray?\" \"What mosque do you attend?\" or \"Why did you convert?\" Donating $100 to a charity to help the needy can lead to questions simply because it is a Muslim-run charity. Today, it is difficult to find an American Muslim who has not had one of these encounters with law enforcement, or knows someone who has. But it's not just the Muslim community.  Journalists, professors, and anti-war activists have been targeted for surveillance, questioning and sometimes investigations by law enforcement based on their speech or political beliefs and activities. Little is publicly known about the full scope of the FBI's activities. Much of it is shrouded in secrecy. But we do know that, according to one former senior FBI counterterrorism official, the FBI conducted nearly 500,000 interviews of Muslim and Arab males from 2001-2005, and not a single one of those interviews led to information that would have allowed the government to detect or prevent the 9/11 attacks. Think about that: For every hour an agent spent talking to someone who had nothing to do with terrorism, that was one hour less spent tracking down a real threat, in this case at least 500,000 hours in four years alone not spent on actual criminals. We also know that the FBI has trained its agents that growing a beard, frequently attending a mosque or wearing traditional Muslim attire reveal extremism. This ignores that the 19 hijackers never grew beards or wore traditional Muslim attire while in the United States and that certain individuals, such as Faisal Shahzad and Colleen LaRose, never frequented a mosque. The FBI should be focused on evidence of criminal activity, not targeting law-abiding Americans. This is not the America our founders envisioned, and certainly not the beacon of liberty our nation aspires to be. America is at its best when we overcome fear and face our challenges together as one people, one nation. On this 10-year anniversary of the Patriot Act, it is time for Congress to act with courage. Congress should amend the law to require law enforcement to focus on actual threats, and should conduct a full public accounting of the use of the Patriot Act and all federal surveillance powers that target Americans based on their race, faith or political ideology. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Farhana Khera.\n### Response: ", "target": "Farhana Khera: Patriot Act allows federal government to spy on innocent Americans .\nFor 10 years, she says, FBI has targeted citizens based on race, faith, and politics .\nKhera: FBI can question you about a Facebook post, or spy on your emails, internet, records .\nAct erodes freedoms, sows fear and mistrust, and needs to be changed, she says .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?(CNN) -- Fuel-saving gas-electric hybrid and all-electric cars and trucks powered by sizable battery packs and high voltage motors could present a new kind of danger at serious accident scenes, according to an industry group. A report by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) highlighted risks to first responders and tow operators from potential electric shock from damaged systems not disengaged during or immediately after a crash. \"As electric vehicles enter the marketplace in greater numbers, it's an appropriate time to recognize best practices that facilitate a safe response when these vehicles are in an accident,\" said Todd Mackintosh, chairman of the SAE technical committee that issued the report earlier this month. The group recommended automakers install switches that would kill battery power in the event of an accident. The location of those switches should be standardized for safety. Another recommendation would create a guide for emergency workers, something Mackintosh called a \"cheat sheet for first responders.\" It would quickly identify the location of high-voltage components allowing them to be disabled. Tow truck drivers also need better information and training on how to handle hybrids and electric vehicles without receiving an unexpected jolt, the report said. More than 435,000 battery powered electric and hybrid electric vehicles were sold in the United States this year, an increase of 53%, compared to 2011 sales numbers, according to the Electric Drive Transportation Association. In May, auto industry officials and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Energy Department discussed potential dangers faced by first responders from electrical charges produced by hybrid and electric cars. NHTSA later issued interim guidance for consumers, emergency responders and tow truck operators to increase awareness about specific dangers. Dangers can be reduced if responders have easy access to battery packs and if auto manufacturers create common disconnect locations in all hybrid and electric vehicles, NHTSA said. Automakers are getting the message out to drivers and responders. Nissan places the battery pack of its LEAF all-electric car in a steel case. The Japanese automaker also designed the battery pack to sense a crash and disable its electrical charge when involved in an accident. Ford has published a guide for first responders encountering its Focus EV involved in accidents. The Focus EV includes what Ford calls \"Electric Badges,\" which are clearly marked logos on the doors and trunk lid to warn responders of possible electric shock. Cables wrapped in orange high-voltage warning sleeves are located under the hood of the Focus EV. General Motors, maker of the Chevy Volt, is also helping to prepare fire service and other first responders. Moreover, GM took steps to better protect the Volt battery pack following a fire that flared after a crash test in 2011. NHTSA found no defect with the lithium-ion battery system nor were any real world crash-fires ever reported. But the case highlighted potential safety concerns for first responders.\n### Response :", "target": "Batteries of hybrid and electric cars could present safety risk in crashes, group says .\nClear labels recommended about battery and power systems to protect first responders .\nMore than 435,000 electric, hybrid vehicles sold in the United States this year, figures show .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

But Cavendish's fellow Brit, Chris Froome, didn't have as good of a day since main rival Alberto Contador cut into his overall lead. \"It was a difficult stage, it was a nervous stage, but finally I'm so excited to win,\" said Cavendish. \"It's been a difficult few days and it's nice to be on the podium again.\" Cavendish, who won his second stage this year and 25th all time, became embroiled in controversy Tuesday when he collided with Tom Veelers as part of a sprint finish. Although he was cleared by race officials, Veelers heavily criticized Cavendish and called for him to be thrown out of cycling's most prestigious race. Cavendish was then sprayed with urine by a fan as the difficult days continued and edged by Marcel Kittel on Thursday in another sprint finish after seemingly looking in control. On Friday, though, Cavendish cruised past Sagan at the finish line. He was part of a group of racers who broke away from the pack -- Contador included -- with about 18 miles of the relatively flat 107-mile stage remaining. Cavendish said his Omega Pharma-Quick Step teammates carried him throughout the stage. \"They gave everything for me yesterday and I let them down,\" said Cavendish, now 84 points behind Cannondale's Sagan. \"Today I just sat there while eight guys rode until their legs fell off. \"I didn't really do anything today. I just crossed the finish line first. In the end it was just Sagan and myself. I was really happy to beat him.\" Team Sky was unable to keep pace with the breakaway pack as crosswinds became a factor, leaving Froome behind two-time race winner Contador. Froome didn't benefit from the support of Edvald Boasson Hagen, who was ruled out of the Tour after breaking his shoulder Thursday. \"I desperately wanted to get on to the Contador move but I was sitting a little too far back,\" said Froome. \"I was just behind Cav's wheel when he sprinted across. \"I think he was the last guy to get across and again it's another reminder that this race is 100 percent open and that there is still everything to race for.\" His lead of three minutes, 25 seconds shrunk, although it wasn't Alejandro Valverde in second. The Movistar rider slipped to 16th overall when he collided with another racer and damaged a wheel. Dutchman Bauke Mollema moved into second, 2:28 behind Froome, and Saxo-Tinkoff's Contador shaved a minute off Froome's advantage to pull to within 2:45. \"I knew I had a really good buffer already -- almost four minutes on Contador,\" said Froome. \"And okay, I worked really hard to get that time gap but you can't win them all. \"It was a really tough day.

But savvy travelers can begin ignoring that commandment of air travel beginning Saturday, when the Transportation Security Administration begins recognizing the latest innovation in aviation security -- checkpoint-friendly computer bags. The TSA said it has worked with bag manufacturers to address one of the biggest frustrations of air travelers, the need to remove computers from carry-on bags and place them in bins. It asked manufacturers to design bags that give X-ray machines a clear, unobstructed view of the laptops. Some 60 manufacturers responded to the TSA's solicitation, with 40 of them submitting prototypes for testing. About a dozen manufacturers are currently advertising checkpoint-friendly bags. Many of the bags are deceptively simple. One common design resembles a clam shell.

A commentary in the official China Daily said U.S. President Barack Obama was deflecting criticism of his own domestic political problems by drawing attention to the rivalry over the currencies, but that the U.S. administration had little heart for an open fight over the issue. \"When the Senate was about to vote on a bill to punish 'currency manipulators' last fall, the White House put it off with strong words and possibly behind-the-scene political maneuvers,\" the newspaper said in a commentary. \"Senior economic officials in the Obama administration know that unless all the major Asian currencies increase in value, even a drastic revaluation of the yuan would simply mean U.S. imports from China would just switch to the other countries in the region.\" The U.S. has long called for the Chinese currency, the yuan or renminbi, to be floated to gain its true value. The administration claim that an artificially suppressed currency is unfair to U.S. exporters, making it cheaper for suppliers to source Chinese manufactured goods. The timing of the visit was not lost on the pro-government Global Times which said the Valentine's Day meeting showed all the complexity of a romantic story. \"China is a newcomer on the diplomatic stage of major powers. It is still unfamiliar with how to use its power and how to deal with provocations from smaller countries,\" the newspaper said in an editorial. \"Facing giants like the U.S. and Europe, China is accustomed to acting with care. It never stirs up trouble willingly, instead, when a crisis occurs, China's first reaction is to seek to defuse tension.\" A common theme in Chinese diplomacy and in its official media is that when backed into a corner, China must pursue its own interests. \"China does not need to satisfy the West at the expense of its own interests. China will not provoke the U.S. and Europe, but it has its own principles to follow,\" the editorial said. \"Chinese officials should take opportunities to make the world understand these.\" While the Chinese also have trade complaints against the U.S., in particular U.S. export controls on high-tech exports, there was no mention of issues that have seen China excluded from U.S. preferential trade right status. Similarly, there was little mention of U.S. criticism of China's human rights record or its position on Syria, both of them sticking point in Sino-U.S. relations. Xi -- who is being groomed for the Chinese presidency - is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit since Obama launched a new U.S. policy in Asia in November designed to reassert its influence in the Pacific.

Welcome to #TeamFifty @JamieDornan1,\" writer E.L. James said in a Twitter post on Thursday. The author's revelation comes after industry trades like The Hollywood Reporter and Variety cited sources saying the 31-year-old actor has been tapped to replace Charlie Hunnam, the \"Sons of Anarchy\" actor who was originally cast as Christian Grey and dropped out in mid-October. So far, Universal Studios and the actor's representatives haven't commented on the reports. Dornan's name may not be that familiar to American audiences, but his face might be. The star, who was born in Northern Ireland, got his start as a model for brands like Dior, Armani and Calvin Klein and posed alongside top names like Kate Moss. Jamie Dornan: Who is he? Before he landed acting roles on U.S. shows like ABC's \"Once Upon A Time,\" on which he played the Huntsman/Sheriff Graham, Dornan was known mainly to U.S. celebrity watchers as the guy dating fellow Brit Keira Knightley. In the UK, he stars in the BBC's psychological thriller \"The Fall.\" While Dornan had been considered the front-runner after Hunnam's exit, his wasn't the only name said to be in consideration. The actor reportedly had competition from British actor Christian Cooke, \"The Borgias'\" Francois Arnaud and \"True Blood\" star Alexander Skarsgard. Hunnam, meanwhile, is looking forward to family time. Charlie Hunnam speaks on '50 Shades' exit . \"I am doing good (after dropping 'Fifty Shades'),\" the 33-year-old recently told E!

The South Korean media reported last month that two patients who had received stem cell procedures in Japan and China had died, and cited allegations that RNL Bio had lured clients to clinics overseas to skirt domestic laws banning stem cell treatment. The ICMS refuted the charges, citing forensic evidence it had gathered from RNL Bio, medical records and interviews from Japan and China. \"It is very important that we distinguish the words cause and correlation,\" said bioethicist Glenn McGee, who participated in the ICMS investigation. He explained that the dangers of the medical procedures undertaken in the treatments does not mean the stem cells used in the therapy are dangerous. The ICMS is the largest multinational group of physicians studying the use of adult stem cells and tracks the cases of about 700 patients around the world who receive treatment. Potential dangers cited in the media about carcinogenic cell growth pertain only to embryonic stem cells and is unrelated to the treatment with adult stem cells that is cited in the investigation, according to the group. No deaths have been reported in the cases registered with the society, according to Audley. The two patients from RNL were not registered with the ICMS, although the bio company does participate in patient registry with the group. In the first of the two cases, a 61-year-old man traveled to China for treatment with stem cells provided by RNL for diabetes and other ailments. He died two months later. His cause of death has not been determined, but it is \"unlikely\" the result of the stem cell procedure, according to the ICMS. The death of a 73-year-old former surgeon, who died on the same day he was treated in Japan, \"was due to a pre-existing blood clot that traveled to the lungs, and may have been precipitated by the procedure used to infuse the stem cells, or less probably, from a clot formed by the cells,\" according to the ICMS findings published on the group's website. Stem cell banking is allowed in clinics such as RNL Bio, which specializes in extracting, cultivating and storing adult stem cells obtained from fatty tissue of patients. Patients are only able to receive treatment with these stored cells overseas, and RNL Bio regularly refers patients to clinics in other countries that are determined capable of using their stem cells. No financial exchanges are made for these referrals, according to Kim Ju-sun, the company's public relations director. The ICMS also concluded in its report that no financial transaction could be traced to RNL Bio from the clinics that conducted the stem cell treatments. Under South Korean regulations, stem cell treatments are not authorized and can only be used in clinical trials approved by the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA). The KFDA and the Ministry of Welfare announced they will conduct an investigation into the potential dangers of unauthorized stem cell treatment in the country and create countermeasures, according to a statement from the KFDA.\n### Response :", "target": "Two patients die following stem cell treatments in China and Japan .\nAn independent group says the deaths are not due to the treatments .\nSuch procedures are not permitted in South Korea .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction :Provide a short summary of the story.UNITED NATIONS (CNN)  -- The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Friday to expand and tighten sanctions on North Korea after that nation's recent nuclear test. The U.N. Security Council votes for a resolution imposing sanctions against North Korea on Friday. The 15-0 vote on U.N. Resolution 1874 imposes an embargo on the shipment of arms from the communist regime and broadens a ban on the import of weapons. \"This resolution provides a strong and united international response to North Korea's test of a nuclear device,\" said U.S. Deputy Ambassador Rosemary DiCarlo. The agreement comes amid rising tension surrounding North Korea, which recently conducted a nuclear test, fired test rockets and threatened U.S. and South Korean ships near its territorial waters. The nuclear test and the firing of six short-range rockets occurred in late May. Pyongyang's actions violated existing U.N. resolutions. The Security Council's five permanent members had already passed a draft resolution Wednesday that condemned North Korea's nuclear test \"in the strongest terms.\" The permanent members -- China, France, Russia, Britain and the United States -- reached the agreement in consultation with Japan and South Korea. The draft resolution reaffirmed that the \"proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, as well as their means of delivery, constitutes a threat to international peace and security.\" That resolution provided a \"strong, very credible, very appropriate response to the provocative nuclear test that North Korea launched and its subsequent activities,\" Susan E. Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters at the time. \"And we think that the message that the council will send ... is that North Korea's behavior is unacceptable, they must pay a price, they ought to return without conditions to a process of negotiations and that the consequences they will face are significant,\" Rice said. Provisions already existing in U.N. Resolution 1718, passed in 2006, are strengthened by the new measure, but others are new, Rice said. The new resolution requires states to \"exercise vigilance\" over the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer to North Korea of small arms or light weapons. Nations would be required to notify the sanctions committee at least five days prior to selling, supplying or transferring small arms or light weapons to North Korea. The resolution calls on all states to inspect vessels suspected of containing contraband. If a ship refuses, it is to proceed to the closest port for a mandatory inspection. A new regulation would prohibit nations from providing bunkering services, such as fuel, to North Korean ships believed to be carrying contraband. The draft also broadens authority to prevent the flow of funds that could benefit North Korea's missile, nuclear or proliferation activities. Late last month, two Defense Department officials said U.S. satellite imagery spotted \"vehicle activity\" at a North Korean ballistic missile facility. The officials said the images showed vehicles used to transport Taepodong-2 missiles, but no missile parts. The Taepodong-2 is a long-range missile North Korea tested in April. That test showed a significant improvement in range from North Korea's initial long-range missile test in 2006. This week, a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak on the record told CNN that Washington had \"indications\" that North Korea may be planning another test. The official would not provide any details, however. President Obama's special envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, called \"simply groundless\" accusations by Pyongyang that its nuclear and rocket tests were in response to American aggression. Washington officials have said the United States' goal is for North Korea to return to nuclear negotiations with the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia, known as the six-party talks.\n### Response: ", "target": "U.N.

{"source": "### Instruction:Produce an article summary of the following news article:Doc to summarize:(CNN) -- Robyn Lawley, an Australian plus-size model, is getting a cyber-standing ovation for posting unretouched and makeup-free photos of herself on Facebook in protest against the pathological airbrushing we've grown accustomed to in professional photography. It's a bold move for the 25-year-old, who was also a vocal critic of the recent Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Her message to women everywhere is clear: Beauty comes in many sizes. The problem is, Lawley is not what average people would call plus-size. In fact, when I initially saw her unretouched photos, I kept scrolling through the gallery looking for her unretouched photos. Her natural beauty is undeniable, but if her body is what the fashion industry is calling plus size, that world is more screwed up than we know. Like, seriously, what kind of hallucinogen do you have to take in order to look at Lawley and think she's on the heavier side? At worst she looks like a fitness instructor at one of those gyms where the women show up in full makeup. I've been to Australia. There are plus-size women there. Lawley, for all of her bravery, should not be considered among them. It's the body image distortion that crammed her into that category, which, for actual plus-size women, can't be a good thing. If a size 6, or even 8, 9, or 10, is the industry's idea of a plus-size woman, then how should the average American woman -- who weighs roughly 165 pounds and wears size 12 or 14 -- describe herself? Morbidly obese? Of course not, which is why size designations have been massaged over time. Many women apparently don't want to know their true size, so what was a size 14 or 16 in the 1950s is an 8 today. Vanity sizing, they call it. This ridiculous shell game is how Lawley, who is a size 12, can be both a plus-size role model and on the thin side of average at the same time. And while this sickeningly unrealistic idea of what we should look like is something mainly inflicted on women, men are not immune. The receding hairline of England's Prince William was infamously resurrected as an issue on a 2010 cover of Hello magazine. Tennis great Andy Roddick's arm grew by 10 inches for his 2007 Men's Fitness cover. Cosmopolitan compiled a hilarious gallery of Photoshopped male celebrities like Jon Hamm next to pictures of how they actually look. Earlier this year male model CJ Richards, talking about photo enhancement, said, \"Why would you watch a movie without special effects? You understand that this isn't real. There's Photoshop in magazines and special effects in movies. I mean, it happens. So accept it and know that this is actually a real person underneath all of the computerized effects that they're adding in.\" Are we really ready to take a look at 'real women'? Fair enough. But then recall the fat-shaming of Prince Fielder after he posed nude in ESPN the Magazine's Body Issue. Or notice such things as the increase in steroid use among young men; global sales of male toiletries other than shaving products surpassing purchase of shaving products for the first time; and popularity of the painful sounding \"Brozilian\" waxes. That's when you see it's not just women who are spending money and risking their health to try to look like a picture in a magazine.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?\n### Input:(CNN) -- It's a good bet that millions of Americans on Monday greeted President Barack Obama's magnificent second inaugural address not just with applause and cheers of approval but with loud sighs of relief. Gone were his first inaugural speech's bizarre equal division of blame for the wreckage of real lives between the \"greed of some\" and the so-called \"collective failure\" of the rest of us. Instead, Obama rang out his commitment to equality for all, not the \"shrinking few and lucky\" who call the rest of us simply \"takers.\" Nor did our president chide us to put away ''childish things\" by seeming to describe deep differences over \"perpetual war,\" climate change, immigration, equal rights, voting rights, rights to decent wages for honest labor and rights to \"basic measures of security and dignity\" as \"petty grievances.\" This time around, Obama offered us not song and dance morals from an old Depression musical comedy to \"pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and start all over again,\" but solid, specific support for the serious New Deal pillars of Social Security and Medicare. Opinion: Obama's ringing defense of liberalism . Almost for the first time as president, he dared to utter the word \"poverty\" in a major address, and declared ''we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice.\" These moments and more earned his speech the warm response and respect it deserves. Now it will receive the careful analysis it cannot escape. This will reveal even more profound differences between Obama's second inaugural speech and his historic appearance on the steps of the U.S. Capitol as the president of color few believed they would see elected in their lifetimes. 1. His first inaugural address was a puzzling disappointment after the passionate convictions he expressed so powerfully in both his primary and general election campaigns. Some suggested that his finest moment was Election Night in Chicago's Grant Park. No one who followed his campaign, including his opponents, could have been surprised by his second inaugural speech. 2. Monday's words were those of a leader who has chosen to fight for the change he believes in over flailing attempts to placate that only produced astounding charges that he was unwilling to compromise when in fact he had given so much in doomed efforts to do just that. 3. His repeated calls for \"We the People\" to work together were not-so-subtle warnings of who would be responsible if the U.S. government is unable to do so. No blame-splitting this time. 4. Even Obama's delivery and demeanor conveyed conviction, not the sense that a press aide might soon emerge from Caesar's tent beside the Rubicon to explain that his thinking is still \"evolving.\" Opinion: How Obama made opportunity real in America . In this second inaugural address, Obama the Candidate became Obama the President without a trace of the bait and switch to which too many citizens have become so accustomed that in their cynicism they cease to vote at all. He spoke as a leader who has stopped splitting differences and is prepared to make choices and fight for them -- together as We the People if possible, alone as Obama the President if not. Opinion: Obama's America, better than what Founders imagined . In fact, Monday's speech felt as if after four frustrating years of trying to appease his opponents, Barack Obama had finally met Machiavelli one night in the Lincoln Bedroom and learned that when faced with two equally powerful opposing forces, a president must choose, or both will attack him. He sounded like a leader who knows now that the difference between making a choice and making love is that decisions don't feel better the longer you can draw them out. As Obama goes from celebration to celebration, his supporters and his opponents have a much clearer idea of what he will do tomorrow, and for the next 1,000-plus days he is president. This time when he tells banks and insurance companies that \"a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play,\" they will do well to believe him. Because even with all the cash he collected to fill the coffers of his campaign, Monday's speech makes it clear he will not let it line the coffin of his presidency.

{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.(CNN) -- \"Bikinis and big booties, y'all. That's what life is about,\" professes Alien, the be-grilled, white Camaro-driving rapper played by James Franco in Harmony Korine's \"Spring Breakers\" (in theaters Friday). Add baby-pink ski masks and more than a little gunplay to the mix, and we're off. The art-sleaze film about the decadent rites of American college kids stars former Disney sweethearts Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens alongside \"Pretty Little Liars' \" Ashley Benson and Korine's wife, Rachel, as broke coeds who stick up a chicken shack to fund the spring break of their dreams. When the partying goes too far and the girls find themselves in jail in St. Petersburg, Florida, it's Alien who bails them out and introduces them to a life that's both darker and more tender than they ever knew. The DayGlo- and dubstep-fueled assault on the senses was written by Korine (\"Kids,\" \"Trash Humpers\") while doing some immersion research in a hotel room in Panama City, Florida, where, he told an audience at the South by Southwest Film Festival in Austin, \"people were blasting Taylor Swift music 24 hours a day, vomiting on my door and snorting donuts. It was crazy.\" \"It's a very base culture,\" he continued, \"and I thought there was some kind of strange poetry in it as well.\" The scenes of spring break, raunchy displays of grinding bodies and guys spilling beer into topless girls' mouths from crotch level, were taken from real-life festivities. \"Some of the scenes we were shooting, and you see we're in the motel room, and all of us are just completely covering our mouths and shocked -- that was all real,\" Gomez said. \"We were witnessing things that were happening that were absolutely crazy and reacting in the realest way.\" \"The images were hypersexualized, hyperviolent,\" Korine said, \"and then the subject matter was all the details: The bikinis and the book bags and the flip-flops and the Hello Kitty bags and the nail polish and the neons and the stickers and the glasses were all real childlike, innocent. I thought it was interesting, both of those things working together. It's a nice backdrop but also a metaphor for what happens later in the film once they meet Alien and what the movie becomes.\" Though Faith, Gomez's comparatively pious character, scans as someone who might have grown out of the \"Wizards of Waverly Place\" and Justin Bieber trajectory, she explained that she chose the role because \"I wanted to see how far I could go.\" Benson said, \"People are used to seeing us in certain roles, and this was a movie where we were able to show people a different side of us, and it was more exciting than anything.\" Hudgens added that their characters are \"a little bit psychotic in their own right, but it's such a liberating experience to be able to do a movie like this.\" But, Gomez cautioned, \"I don't necessarily want to know what people are going to say or think\" about her choice. \"It's just better that way. I can't really make anyone happy. I'm an actor, and I love what I do, so if I want to do something I'm super passionate about, I'm just going to go for it. If people like it, awesome.

The limited flight clearance, approved by Navy and Air Force officials Monday, allows the aircraft to fly with an engine inspection regimen and restricted flight envelope following the fleet's grounding after an engine fire last month. Defense Department spokesman Mark Wright said in a statement Tuesday the restrictions would \"remain in effect until the root cause of the June 23 engine mishap is identified and corrected.\" It had been hoped that the stealth fighter would be able to make an appearance at the famed Farnborough air show, under way now, but Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Tuesday afternoon that won't happen. \"The Department of Defense, in concert with our partners in the U.K., has decided not to send Marine Corps and U.K. F-35B aircraft across the Atlantic to participate in the Farnborough air show,\" he told reporters.  \"This decision was reached after a consultation with senior leaders and airworthiness authorities, despite the decision by airworthiness authorities to clear the aircraft to return to flight -- to limited flight.\" The 2014 Farnborough International Airshow began Monday, and runs through July 20 in Farnborough, England.  The opening day brought $42 billion of orders and commitments for commercial aircraft and engines, according to a statement from the show's organizers. The F-35 was developed at a cost of nearly $400 billion so far and beset for years by cost overruns and delays. The so-called Joint Strike Fighter was temporarily grounded following a fire on the runway at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. No one was hurt. Engine maker Pratt & Whitney worked with Air Force investigators to inspect all engines in the fleet. \"We have great confidence in the F135 engine powering the F-35, and we have worked very closely with DoD and the Services to return the aircraft to flying status,\" Matthew Bates, communications manager for Pratt & Whitney Military Engines, said in a statement Tuesday. The F-35's lead contractor, Lockheed Martin, which is producing variants of the plane for the U.S. Navy, Marines and Air Force,  also worked with investigators following the fleet's grounding. F-35 future . The Pentagon wants more than 2,400 of the fighter jets ultimately, while hundreds more are expected over time to go to allies such as South Korea, Japan and Australia. More than 100 planes have been built so far, most for testing, but the program is still in its development and training phases. The military says the stealthy fighter will be \"the most affordable, lethal, supportable and survivable aircraft ever to be used\" by so many services worldwide. But its production has been controversial for its soaring cost history -- the price tag has nearly doubled from early estimates, to $135 million per unit as of last year, according to a U.S. Government Accountability Office report in March -- as well as its schedule, software and other setbacks. Test flights began in 2007. While all models have been grounded in the past for various problems, the version for the Marines, the F-35B, has had more issues. Experts say that's mainly due to its design for shorter takeoffs and vertical landings. Richard Aboulafia, a Teal Group analyst, said earlier this month that every component of the F-35 overall \"is pushing the frontiers of technology\" as engineers combine extraordinary engine power with a lighter weight design. He said the program has made gradual progress in recent years where glitches get resolved pretty quickly compared with 18 to 24 months ago, when setbacks seemed to come one right after another. \"It's a tremendously complex project,\" he said, adding that cost issues remain a concern.\n### Response:", "target": "The F-35 won't participate in the Farnborough air show, Pentagon spokesman says .\nThe return to flight order is a limited flight clearance .\nThe F-35 fleet was grounded after an engine fire in June .\nPratt & Whitney, Lockheed Martin working with investigators to find cause of fire .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

(CNN) -- An Arizona mother has admitted to suffocating her 13-year-old daughter and trying to kill her other children by poisoning them, police said Tuesday. Officers in Casa Grande, Arizona, responded to a 911 call on Christmas Day. A man said that his ex-wife, 35-year-old Connie Villa, had stabbed him but that he had managed to escape and was driving himself to a hospital. When officers arrived at the home, they found Villa with stab wounds, holding a knife to her chest. They managed to subdue her and conducted a sweep of the home. Police found the body of Aniarael Macias, Villa's daughter, in the bathroom. \"Although an autopsy for Aniarael was conducted ... the results of which did not identify a cause of death, investigators feel the evidence found at the scene of the crime along with interviews and medical information of the surviving children, give our Department cause to believe Connie Villa was attempting to end the lives of all of her children and her ex-husband, Adam Villa,\" police said in a statement. Connie Villa faces one count of first degree murder in the death of her daughter. She is also being charged with four counts of attempted murder of her ex-husband and her three surviving children, ages 3, 5 and 8. In an interview, she admitted she tried to kill her children by forcing them to ingest prescription narcotic drugs, police said. The kids had trace amounts of opiates in their systems. Police also said that she told them she was unsuccessful in forcing her oldest daughter to ingest the drugs, and so she suffocated Aniarael. Connie Villa reportedly told investigators she wanted to kill her children and ex-husband because she did not want him to have custody of them. The surviving children are all in good condition and were placed with the family of their father, Adam Villa, 33. He is in stable condition. Connie Villa was released Sunday from Maricopa Medical Center, where she was treated for what investigators believe were self-inflicted stab wounds. She was arrested the same day.

About 350,000 customers across 12 states and the District of Columbia will be suffering in this heat without the benefits of electricity, including power for their air conditioning and for refrigeration to keep their food edible, according to a CNN count from Friday night. Because utilities typically define each residential and business account as a customer, the actual number of people affected was not clear. Many of these people have gone without power for a full week, thanks to strong storms fueled by the heat that barreled east from Indiana to New Jersey. Others have watched more recent but similar storms leave them in the dark. Gadgets to help you survive a power outage . The hardest-hit state continues to be West Virginia, where about 167,000 customers had no power Friday night. \"It's been a very, very serious and critical situation,\" said John David, a West Virginia University Institute of Technology professor and volunteer with the South Appalachian Labor School who has been working in Fayette County. \"But people here are used to sacrifice.\" Nationwide, more than 4,500 record-high daily temperatures have been set in the past 30 days, according to the National Climatic Data Center. And since June 23, scores of cities have been the hottest they've ever been, on any day ever recorded. That includes 107 in Colorado Springs, 109 in Nashville and 106 in Atlanta. In Washington, the thermometer has gone past 95 degrees for nine straight days -- the longest such streak since modern record-keeping began. The high temperatures have been linked to a number of deaths nationwide. That includes five deaths -- of men ages 48, 58 and 59 and two women ages 81 and 91 -- because of \"heat stress\" in Chicago, city public health spokesman Efrat Stein said Friday. Another heat-related death was reported in nearby Cook County, according to Stein. Another three heat-related deaths were reported in Rock County, Wisconsin, according to Chief Deputy Coroner Louis Smit. Heat was ruled an \"exacerbating factor\" in two of those cases, and it was a \"major factor\" in the death of an 83-year-old woman found dead \"from a cardiac-related condition\" in a home that was 95 degrees inside and had \"no cold water or other fluids.\" Powerful storms tied to the weather system have left dozens dead. Most recently, two people died and eight were injured when a storm struck Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains National Park on Thursday night, park officials said. 2 dead in Great Smoky Mountains Park storm .

Mike Chinoy: \"I described the gunfire and the bodies.\" Chinoy was on the balcony at \"Tokyo base\" -- the network's nickname for its makeshift bureau at the Beijing Hotel down the avenue from Tiananmen Square -- watching soldiers march into the square with guns firing. He was also constantly on the phone with CNN Atlanta, giving the network live \"beeper\" updates on what was happening there. CNN's live video capability had long been pulled by the Chinese authorities. And CNN's first pictures from the square had already been confiscated.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?\n### Input:(CNN) -- As regional fears of a spillover from Syria's civil war increase, Israel plans to build a fence along the border with the embattled country. The announcement came Sunday during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's weekly Cabinet address, in which he cited the construction of a 230-kilometer (143-mile) fence along Israel's southern border with Egypt. Read more: Scavenging for food, Syrian children witness war . \"We intend to erect an identical fence, with a few changes based on the actual territory, along the Golan Heights. We know that on (the) other side of our border with Syria today, the Syrian army has moved away, and in its place, global jihad forces have moved in,\" Netanyahu said, according to a transcript of his remarks. \"Therefore, we will defend this border against both infiltration and terrorism, just as we are successfully doing on the Sinai border.\" Syrian opposition and government sources have reported that the extremist al-Nusra Front, which the United States has designated as a terrorist group with links to al Qaeda in Iraq, has taken part in some of the fighting in Syria. Watch: Syrian refugees dig in for the winter . Netanyahu also said the Syrian government is \"very unstable\" and expressed concerns about the possible use of chemical weapons. Israel seized the Golan Heights, along with the West Bank, Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula, during the 1967 war. The Sinai has since been returned to Egypt. Israel annexed the Golan Heights in 1981, a move not recognized by the international community and condemned by Syria, which still claims the land. Chaos from Syria's civil war has already spilled into Turkey and Jordan. Read more: Al-Assad says enemies of Syria 'will go to hell' Last month, shells and bullets landed in Jordanian territory because of fighting between government and rebel forces in western Syria. One Jordanian soldier was wounded, Jordan's armed forces said. And last week, U.S. troops started arriving near the Turkish-Syrian border to man Patriot missile defense batteries, which are intended to intercept any Scud missiles that might cross into Turkey from Syria. The move was made after Syria launched Scud missiles at cities near the Turkish border. The batteries began arriving Monday, video showed. \"The deployment, which will take place over the next few weeks, will be defensive only,\" NATO stressed in a statement Monday. \"It will not support a no-fly zone or any offensive operation. Its aim is to deter any threats to Turkey, to defend Turkey's population and territory and to de-escalate the crisis on NATO's southeastern border.\" In October, five Turkish civilians were killed when errant Syrian artillery shells struck the Turkish border town of Akcakale. The Syrian government: Talk of reform leads to heavy skepticism . Syria's prime minister called Monday for Cabinet members to convene and decide how to implement measures announced by President Bashar al-Assad, state-run TV reported Monday. No date was announced for the meeting. In his first public speech since June, al-Assad outlined a plan Sunday to resolve the Syrian crisis. His plan includes national dialogue and a new constitution that would be put up for a public referendum. But there's a major caveat to the plan: Al-Assad said he refuses to deal with \"terrorists,\" a term the government often uses to describe the opposition. Similarly, opposition members have said they will not work directly with al-Assad's \"criminal\" government, nor will they accept any solution that doesn't involve al-Assad's departure. So the deadly impasse continues. World leaders slammed al-Assad's speech, with British Foreign Secretary William Hague calling it \"beyond hypocritical.\" \"Deaths, violence and oppression engulfing #Syria are his own making, empty promises of reform fool no one,\" Hague tweeted. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday that he was \"disappointed\" by the speech, saying \"it does not contribute to a solution that could end the terrible suffering of the Syrian people.\" At least 71 people, including seven children, were killed Monday in fresh violence, the opposition Local Coordination Committees said. More than 60,000 Syrians have been killed in the past 22 months, according to the United Nations. The chaos started in March 2011, when peaceful anti-government protesters were met by a fierce government crackdown, which spiraled into an armed opposition movement and a civil war.

{"source": "### Instruction: Can you give me a quick rundown?Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A 15-year-old girl allegedly tortured by her in-laws in Afghanistan after she refused to be forced into prostitution is not doing well in hospital, aid workers say. Sahar Gul was rescued by police last month in the country's northern Baghlan province after she was locked in the basement of her in-laws' house, starved and her nails pulled out. She is safe, but signs of the abuse she's suffered remain all too clear, said Wazhma Frogh of the Afghan Women's Network. Sahar is too weak to move her body, which has black bruise marks all over from being beaten, and the nurses gave her diapers because she can't get to the toilet, Frogh said. The girl's eyes are bruised and she can't speak. Her hair was also cut short by her in-laws as a punishment after she refused to sleep with other men. A photograph provided by the Afghan Women's Network shows her asleep in a hospital bed, the bruising on her face obvious and her head bandaged. The mental trauma she suffered is also affecting her, and is under medication to help her deal with it, Frogh said. \"We've also provided her with a trauma counselor because she is very traumatized and even when I wanted to take her hand, she resisted,\" despite being unconscious, Frogh said. Because the teenager was beaten and assaulted, she added, \"now she doesn't want anyone to even touch her.\" Last month, authorities in Baghlan said they rescued the girl after hearing reports that she was tortured after she refused to be forced into prostitution. But, they said, they were waiting for her to fully recover to talk to her and learn more. Sahar was married off to a 30-year-old man about seven months ago. After her parents reported not seeing her for months, police launched their investigation, Baghlan police official Jawid Basharat said at the time. Meanwhile, Sahar's father-in-law, mother-in-law and sister-in-law have been arrested but her husband -- who Frogh said is thought to be a soldier serving in Helmand province -- has not been caught. The Women's Network is determined to do its best to ensure she gets the care she needs -- but Frogh warned that her recovery won't be easy. \"She needs proper food, proper care that our government's hospitals don't have, therefore we have been collecting donations to provide to the hospital to buy her good food, clothing and other basic needs,\" she said. \"We also have to think of her shelter once she is back into normal life, which is going to take some months.\" At the same time, the Women's Network has found a lawyer for Sahar and has persuaded the Afghan authorities to move the investigation to Kabul, where there will be less influence from the local community, Frogh said. It has also contacted the attorney general to appeal for a faster investigation before the girl's in-laws are released from custody. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has called for the abuse to be \"seriously investigated,\" his office said in a statement Sunday. CNN's Masoud Popalzai contributed to this report.\n### Response :", "target": "Sahar Gul is found by police locked in the basement of her in-laws' house .\nThe teenager is starved, beaten and her nails are pulled out .\nHer in-laws abused her after she refused to be forced into prostitution, aid workers say .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given text.\n### Input: (Rolling Stone) -- Last night, Lady Gaga's \"Born This Way\" (out Monday) leaked online. The contents of the disc haven't been a total mystery -- Gaga's released four singles from the album, her third, since February, and has performed other songs from it in concert -- but she still managed to pack in some surprises. Here, Rolling Stone senior critic Jody Rosen goes through the album song by song. \"Marry the Night\" -- It begins big, with Gaga belting \"I'm gonna marry the night/I won't give up on my life\" over tolling, church-like synths. And it just gets bigger. And bigger. And bigger still. The chorus arrives in an eruption of drums and power chords; there's a pummeling funk-rock breakdown; and the touchstones are Eighties arena pop and hair metal: Pat Benatar, Bonnie Tyler, Bon Jovi. \"Born This Way\" -- Yeah, yeah: it's an \"Express Yourself\" bite. And yes: you've heard the song 700 hundred times in the last month. But Gaga's big hit sounds different in the context of the album that shares its name: like an experiment in the audacious plus-sizing of Eighties dance-pop. \"Government Hooker\" -- The requisite \"kinky\" song -- though what exactly Gaga is saying here isn't clear: \"I'll be your hooker/Government hooker,\" \"I could be Mom/Unless you want to be Dad.\" But the techno-pop production, by DJ White Shadow, is gripping: a shape-shifting assemblage of buzzes, beeps and clattering beats. Choice couplet: \"Put your hands on me/John F. Kennedy.\" \"Judas\" -- \"Wear an ear condom\" next time, Gaga sings in a track with one of the catchiest choruses on an album devoted to catchy choruses above all. Gagaologists will spend years pouring over the runes of that rapped bridge. (\"But in the cultural sense/I just speak in future tense,\" etc.) The rest of us will be busy dancing to Red One's walloping production. (Watch the video.) \"Americano\" -- The campiest song Gaga's recorded yet, which is saying something. A disco-fied showtune with a pronounced \"Latin\"-flavor, complete with flamenco guitars and castanets. Possibly about a star-crossed lesbian romance. Definitely set in East Los Angeles. Completely hilarious. \"Hair\" -- Gaga is not the first songwriter to link self-esteem and liberation to free-flowing coiffure. (Remember that rock musical called, um, \"Hair\"? Remember \"Whip My Hair\"?) But she's definitely the most committed. \"I am my hair!\" she cries. Red One supplies the gale force hair-tousling synths. \"Schei\u00dfe\" -- Gaga speaks a little German and intones some inspirational platitudes alongside some generic Eurodisco thump and a wisp of a chorus. \"Bloody Mary\" -- A sluggish tempo, goofy \"goth\" atmospherics and a lyric that sounds like bad high school poetry: \"We are not just art for Michaelangelo to carve/He can't rewrite the agro of my furied heart.\" \"Bad Kids\" -- In which Gaga reminiscences about her misspent youth and croons an ode to juvenile delinquents, set to forgettable Eighties synth-pop. \"Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)\" -- Gaga does her best Springsteen. Or is it Meatloaf? \"Get your hot rods ready to rumble/'Cause we're gonna fall in love tonight/Get your hot rods ready to rumble/'Cause we're gonna drink until we die.\" Sublime schlock, with the biggest, thuddingest drum sound you've heard this century. \"Heavy Metal Lover\" -- More smutty talk, set against a wall of fuzzy synthesizer sound. \"I want your whiskey mouth/All over my blond south,\" Gaga commands. \"Electric Chapel\" -- It earns its title with some heavy guitar riffing and a squealing metal solo towards the end. The lyric holds out hope for monogamous romance: \"Together we'll find a way/To make pure love work in a dirty way.\" \"You and I\" -- Gaga's signature power ballad -- a fan favorite since she first played it live in 2009 -- gets the treatment it merits. Produced by \"Mutt\" Lange, guitar solo by Queen's Brian May, with a torrid, sturm und drang vocal turn by Gaga. It's a confession. (Gaga watchers speculate it's about her on-again off-again boyfriend Luc Carl.) It's also the greatest Def Leppard song Lady Gaga has ever written. \"The Edge of Glory\" -- Those hooks! That chorus! That Clarence Clemons sax solo! \"Born This Way\" goes out in a blaze of shlock-pop glory.(Listen.)

Sheikh Shawky Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam spoke about the recent execution of a Jordanian pilot at the hands of ISIS. Lt. Moath al-Kasasbeh, 27, was burned alive while confined in a cage. \"What happened to the Jordanian pilot is by all means a crime. This barbaric action is far away from humanity, much less religions. Islam is innocent of this act,\" the grand mufti said on Thursday. Allam leads Dar El-Ifta, or the House of Fatwas, the premier authority in Islamic legal interpretations. The institution was founded in 1895, although the grand muftis of Egypt have been interpreting Islam for 800 years. It releases more than 500,000 edicts a year. The battle is ideological, Allam said, and the fight is not confined to Egypt or the Middle East. \"Violence and radicalization have become an international phenomenon that has no home or belief. But it runs through the entire world,\" he said. The pilot's death was captured in a horrific video that was posted online this week. ISIS has distributed footage of its executions before, but previous videos showed beheadings. The grand mufti weighed whether beheadings could ever be justified by Islam. He considered the example of Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the region. There, defendants may be sentenced to death and beheaded. \"What happens in Saudi Arabia is based on judicial investigations and implementing the predominant law. If it is the case, then we respect the rule of law in this state,\" Allam said. By contrast, he argued, ISIS does not follow any system of investigation. \"Everything ISIS does is far away from Islam. What it is doing is a crime by all means,\" the grand mufti said. Earlier this year, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi called for a \"religious revolution.\" Allam believes in the need for reform, but he also believes the foundation of Islam must remain untouched. What does this mean? It means \"renewing the methods, renewing the tools, and renewing the way Islam's teachings are presented, \" Allam said. \"At the same time, we preserve and uphold the stable pillars of religion. Rattling the pillars leads to destabilizing communities.\" In an effort to reclaim the voice of Islam from radical groups, Dar Al-Ifta issues publications in 10 languages, engages in awareness campaigns and joins regional and international efforts to battle extremist ideas and to present a better image of Islam. The grand mufti's advice to young Muslims is to seek specialized scholars to understand the true meaning of Islam. \"We tell youth, Islam didn't carry a message of sabotage and destruction. It only came to serve humanity, to achieve world peace and bring mercy to the world,\" he said.\n### Response: ", "target": "Grand mufti of Egypt says actions of ISIS are far from Islamic .\nSheikh Shawky Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam leads the premier authority in Islamic legal interpretations .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Police initially couldn't determine her gender. Doctors weren't sure if she would survive. Now, more than two years later, physicians at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston have released the first post-surgery pictures of Nash since she received a full face transplant in May. \"These professionals first saved my life, then healed my wounds and strengthened me to face an uncertain future,\" Nash said in a statement Thursday. \"I will now be able to do things I once took for granted ... I will have lips and will speak clearly once again. I will be able to kiss and hug loved ones. I am tremendously grateful to the donor and her family.\" Doctors who performed the surgery called Nash courageous. \"She inspired the team to do everything possible, using our collective expertise, to restore her quality of life,\" said Plastic Surgery Transplantation Director Dr. Bohdan Pomahac, after the surgery. In February 2009, Nash was helping a friend coax her 14-year-old pet chimp, Travis, back into the house. When Nash arrived, the chimp, who had been featured in television commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, jumped on her and began biting and mauling her. Police later shot Travis to stop the attack and he died of gunshot wounds. The unprovoked attack sparked outrage from both animal rights activists and Congress which swiftly passed a bill prohibiting the purchase and transportation of primates across state lines. Nash remained in critical condition for months and was moved to Brigham and Women's Hospital in June 2010, where she became the third person to receive a full face transplant at the hospital. Doctors also successfully attached two new hands, but a few days later Nash became sick and the hands were removed. Nash called the loss a \"bump\" in the road to her recovery. \"I was given the chance to restore most of what I lost by coming to Brigham and Women's Hospital,\" she said. \"Here, I received a new face ... that will allow me to be independent again and able to be a part of society.\" Her new face, she said, has brought her back to life.\n### Response:", "target": "Charla Nash is the third person to receive a full face transplant .\nNash lost her face and both hands in a chimpanzee attack in 2009 .\nNash says: \"I was brought back to life\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Didier Drogba scored a hat-trick as Chelsea bounced back from last weekend's 3-1 Community Shield defeat by main rivals Manchester United, who take on the third promoted side, Newcastle, on Monday evening. Florent Malouda put the London team ahead in the sixth minute on Saturday evening after West Brom goalkeeper Scott Carson spilled Drogba's free-kick, and the Ivory Coast striker made it 2-0 on the stroke of halftime when he curled another set-piece through a poorly-assembled defensive wall. Ten minutes after the break, Drogba scrambled in his second after John Terry's header was blocked on the line, and midfielder Frank Lampard slotted in on 63 after England teammate Ashley Cole squared the ball into his path. Drogba was the Premier League's top scorer last season with 29 goals, and is on target to repeat that feat after his 68th-minute shot was deflected past Carson off the head of defender Gabriel Tamas. English Premier League preview . It lifted him up to sixth on the club's all-time scoring list with 133 goals, putting him above Jimmy Greaves, who played for Chelsea from 1957-61. France winger Malouda sealed a miserable day for West Brom manager Roberto Di Matteo, a former Chelsea player, as he beat the offside trap and fired in off the post in the 90th minute. It was the biggest opening-day win since the Premier League began in 1992. Blackpool, unable to pay their players bonuses for winning promotion via the playoffs until this month, took a 3-0 lead at halftime against Wigan as striker Gary Taylor-Fletcher netted before a double from new signing Marlon Harewood. Goalkeeper Chris Kirkland was at fault for both Harewood' efforts, and was again exposed in the second half as he was beaten at the near post by Alex Baptiste's shot from the touchline. It was a remarkable day for Blackpool, overwhelming favorites to be relegated in the club's first season in the top flight since 1971, as they ended the day second in the table despite a fruitless summer in the transfer market that finally saw free agent Harewood and three little-known Frenchmen arrive this week. \"I will take a photograph of the table and then retire,\" manager Ian Holloway said. \"It has been a horrible summer and I am quite worn out. This is quite a scary place to be.\" In the opening match of the season, Tottenham drew 0-0 with big-spending Manchester City in an early-afternoon battle between last season's fourth and fifth-placed teams. City boss Roberto Mancini fielded three of his five new signings in Yaya Toure, David Silva and Aleksandar Kolarov, but needed young England goalkeeper Joe Hart -- starting ahead of last season's first choice Shay Given -- to keep out a wave of Tottenham attacks. The London side, who face Swiss side Young Boys Berne in the final round of Champions League qualifiers next week, also hit the post through Gareth Bale. City lost Serbia defender Kolarov to injury at halftime, but should have taken the lead through Shaun Wright-Phillips as the winger lost the ball in front of goal. Both sides had several half-chances before Bale also squandered a great chance, and the game petered out in a draw despite a raft of substitutions as Spurs brought on forwards Robbie Keane, Roman Pavlyuchenko and Giovani Dos Santos while City introduced Adam Johnson and Emmanuel Adebayor. Aston Villa, still seeking to replace departed manager Martin O'Neill, crushed West Ham 3-0 in Avram Grant's first Premier League match in charge of the London team. Stewart Downing and Stiliyan Petrov gave the home team a 2-0 lead, then James Milner sealed victory with a 66th-minute strike in what could be the England midfielder's final game for Villa before joining Manchester City. The 24-year-old was given a standing ovation by the crowd when he was substituted late in the game. Blackburn won 1-0 at home to Everton as young Croatian striker Nikola Kalinic took advantage of a mistake by United States goalkeeper Tim Howard to score the 15th-minute winner. Birmingham came from 2-0 down to secure a draw at Sunderland, who had new captain Lee Cattermole sent off in the first half. The home side led in the 24th minute with a penalty from last season's top scorer Darren Bent, then midfielder Cattermole received two yellow cards before defender Stephen Carr -- who had conceded the spot-kick -- headed into his own net 11 minutes into the second half. Scott Dann pulled one back with a header on 78 then defender Gary Ridgewell earned a point two minutes from time. Wolverhampton beat Stoke 2-1 as the visitors lost record signing Kenwyne Jones to injury. Jones, a $12 million buy from Sunderland, hit the crossbar early on but needs a scan after suffering an ankle problem soon after. Wolves took a 2-0 lead at halftime as David Jones and new strike Steven Fletcher scored just before the break, then Abdoulaye Faye gave Stoke hope with a header 10 minutes after the restart. Fulham drew 0-0 at Bolton in manager Mark Hughes' first game in charge, with the home side hitting the post through U.S. midfielder Stuart Holden in the second half. Hughes did not pick veteran Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer, who handed in a transfer request during the week as he seek to join Arsenal. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger signed a new three-year contract ahead of his team's opening match of the season at Liverpool on Sunday.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?\n### Input:(CNN) -- It was far from vintage Barcelona, but it was enough to keep alive the Catalan club's dwindling hopes of retaining the Spanish league title. With white handkerchiefs waving in the Camp Nou to indicate the fans' frustration at what appeared to be another disappointing setback, Lionel Messi came to the rescue on Sunday to earn a 2-1 victory against Athletic Bilbao. Having been knocked out of the Champions League, then losing the Copa del Rey final to Real Madrid, Gerardo Martino's team had been staring down the barrel of an unthinkable fourth successive defeat. With Atletico Madrid having gone seven points clear at the top of the table with Friday's 2-0 win over Elche, it would've spelled disaster if Barca could not recover from Aritz Aduriz's opener for the fourth-placed Basques. The early signs weren't good. After Messi had a goal ruled out for offside, Aduriz hit the Barca woodwork with a spectacular overhead kick, then Alexis Sanchez smacked the Bilbao bar when it seemed easier to score. Aduriz ghosted through Barca's frail defense to slot in a low shot five minutes after the break, and teammate Markel Susaeta had an effort ruled out for offside soon after. To the home supporters' intense relief, Pedro provided the equalizer in the 72nd minute with his 15th league goal this season, diverting a low shot from Sanchez into the net from close range. Soon after that, Messi picked himself up after being fouled on the edge of the penalty area and fired a free-kick through the wall. It ended what, for the four-time world player of the year, was a goal drought -- four games without scoring -- as he netted for the 26th time in La Liga, leaving him third in the Pichichi standings behind Atletico's Diego Costa (27) and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo (28). It proved to be the winner, though Barca needed Javier Mascherano -- who squandered a great scoring chance not long beforehand -- to make a brave block to stop a goal-bound Bilbao shot in time added on. The result left Barca four points behind Atletico with four games to play -- the last of which will be between the two teams at the Camp Nou. It lifted Barca into second place above Real, without a match this weekend ahead of Wednesday's Champions League semifinal first leg at home to Bayern Munich. Atletico, meanwhile, will be seeking to make it an all-Spanish final as the capital team hosts English club Chelsea in Tuesday's opening leg. Earlier Sunday, Sevilla consolidated fifth place with a 4-0 win at home to Granada, Rayo Vallecano moved up to mid-table safety with a 3-1 win that almost certainly condemned Real Betis to relegation, and Celta Vigo beat second-bottom Almeria 4-2.

The Serbian, who triumphed at the grass-court grand slam in 2011, cannot face defending champion Roger Federer, second-ranked Andy Murray or two-time winner Rafael Nadal before the July 7 men's final. Nadal has been seeded a lowly fifth despite his successful comeback from long-term knee injury, which culminated in a record eighth French Open title this month. He lost in the second round at London's SW19 a year ago, which turned out to be his last match until February. The 27-year-old faces the prospect of renewing his rivalry with Federer in the quarterfinals, and the winner of that match will possibly face Murray. Murray, last year's runner-up, is seeded to play France's world No. 7 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the last eight. Murray will begin his bid to become Britain's first male champion since Fred Perry in 1936 when he takes on Benjamin Becker. He defeated the 32-year-old German -- as well as Tsonga -- on the way to winning the title at Queen's Club on Sunday, having missed the French Open due to injury. Federer, seeded third, will start against Romania's Victor Hanescu in Monday's opening matches as he seeks to win his 18th grand slam title and a record eighth Wimbledon crown. Nadal, on a 22-match winning streak, will play 113th-ranked Belgian Steve Darcis in the first round while Djokovic takes on Germany's Florian Mayer. Djokovic could play world No. 6 Tomas Berdych in the quarterfinals ahead of a possible match against Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer -- who could face eighth-ranked Argentine Juan Martin del Potro in the last eight. Ferrer reached his first grand slam final at Roland Garros this month, but had no answer to an in-form Nadal -- who had beaten Djokovic in an epic semi encounter. In the Wimbledon women's draw, defending champion and top seed Serena Williams cannot face Maria Sharapova or Victoria Azarenka until the final. The American, who beat Sharapova in the French Open final, could face a rematch of last year's title match with fourth-ranked Pole Agnieszka Radwanska in the semis. The 31-year-old will first take on Luxembourg's 77th-ranked Mandy Minella, who lost in the first round last year. Radwanska is drawn to meet China's former French Open champion Li Na in the last eight.

The Russian, who won the tournament as a 17-year-old in 2004, is seeded to face Italian No. 5 Sara Errani in the quarterfinals before a possible clash with Azarenka -- who she beat in the Paris semis.

There were the dungarees he wore as a little boy, the dark bell-bottoms he had on for a hike up Japan's Mount Fuji, and the Levis straight-leg 501 jeans he's stayed with for the past 36 years. At 54, Heston doesn't get embarrassed anymore, \"but if I had to share any of these blue jean moments a few years back, I would have been a little more reluctant,\" he says. In particular, there was the snapshot of him on a Hawaii beach in a Daishiki and jeans his mother extended with red fabric because he was growing faster than his pants were wearing out. May 20, 1873, is considered the birthday of blue jeans. Readers shared their favorite and most cringe-inducing moments in denim (hello, acid wash) to mark the occasion. \"They're the most unique piece of clothing everyone owns because they keep changing as you wear them,\" said Angelika Corrente, who runs Denimhead, global trend forecaster WGSN's denim division. A few facts about denim: . 1. Jacob Davis, a tailor in Reno, Nevada, came up with the idea of riveted pants in response to a customer whose pockets kept ripping. He feared someone might steal his idea and recruited Levi Strauss, owner of dry goods wholesaler Levi Strauss & Co., as a business partner. They obtained a patent on May 20, 1873. 2. Denim jeans -- or trousers, waist overalls or dungarees -- started out as work-wear for hard labor in mines, factories and fields. By the 1980s, as high fashion brands began to introduce the concept of designer jeans, the shape and fit began to slim down. 3. Consumers in the United States buy approximately 450 million pairs of jeans every year. 4. On average, U.S. consumers have seven pairs of jeans in their wardrobe, according to Cotton Incorporated. 5. Environmental awareness has pushed denim laundries to improve techniques for bleaching and coating jeans to give them different looks, Corrente said. Where lots of water, aggressive washing and sandpaper was once the norm for creating that worn vintage look, lasers and and ozone gas cameras are now being used to minimize water waste and chemical runoff. 6. This year's trends are marked by a hybrid appreciation for fads of other eras. You're as likely to see someone rocking the heavy raw denim popular among '60s bikers and rebellious youth, an '80s-inspired high-waisted, flower print, or the acid-washed, ripped-up grunge look of the '90s.

Experts called the change great news _ apparent evidence that doctors and women have absorbed warnings about the risks of C-sections and the importance of waiting to deliver until the baby is full-term. \n  \n \"People are getting the message,\" said Dr. Barbara Stoll, an Emory University specialist in the care of newborns. \n  \n A C-section is major surgery with risks of infection and, in very rare cases, death. Recovery time is longer than with a vaginal delivery. And the babies can be more likely to have breathing difficulties and other medical problems. \n  \n For decades, the operations were done in only a small fraction of births, usually only when a fetus was in danger. In 1970, the U.S. rate was 5 percent of all births. \n  \n By 2009, about a third of births were C-sections. Experts say many factors drove the rate up, including the convenience of scheduling deliveries. \n  \n But that rate has at least stopped rising for two years. The overall rate was again about 33 percent in 2011, the latest year available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n  \n Thursday's report focused on preliminary data for that year's single-child deliveries, which are about 96 percent of all births. The trend there was similar to the overall numbers: The C-section rate has held steady at 31 percent since 2009, after rising for a dozen straight years. \n  \n The report found very little change in C-sections through 37 weeks of gestation between 2009 and 2011. But at 38 weeks there were fewer: the rate fell 5 percent, to 32 percent. \n  \n And at 39 weeks, it rose 4 percent, to 34 percent of births. The rate at 40 weeks held steady at 25 percent. \n  \n A full-term pregnancy is 39 to 40 weeks. The changes occurred across the board, for all major racial and ethnic groups and for all ages of mothers. \n  \n CDC health statistician Michelle Osterman said they had hoped to figure out from the report why the overall rates had leveled off, but it didn't provide any answers. Health officials want to push the rate down to a goal of 15 percent. \n  \n Still, the shift to later C-sections is great news, said Dr. George Macones, head of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University in St. Louis. \n  \n \"The important thing is babies born before 39 weeks have more complications than babies born at 39 weeks and beyond,\" Macones said. \n  \n ___ \n  \n Online: \n  \n CDC report: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ |||||\n### Response :", "target": "\u2013 Cesarean sections, long decried as ubiquitous, costly, and often unnecessary, have halted a dozen years of consecutive increases, finds a new federal report.

{"source": "### Instruction: What's the text mainly about?A three-speed global economy faces risks from a currency crisis in emerging markets or unsustainable debt in the US and Japan, IMF managing director Christine Lagarde has warned. Speaking ahead of the International Monetary Fund's spring meeting in Washington next week, Ms Lagarde said that the world was dividing into three groups -- some countries doing well, some on the mend and some still in trouble. Her speech highlights a new phase for the global economy in which the uneven pace of growth around the world is creating new financial imbalances that could sow the seeds of a future crisis. \"We do not expect global growth to be much higher this year than last. We are seeing new risks as well as old risks,\" Ms Lagarde told an audience in New York on Wednesday. \"In far too many countries, improvements in financial markets have not translated into improvements in the real economy.\" Emerging economies were growing fast, she said, but low interest rates in advanced economies were prompting them to build up debt and foreign exchange exposure that could cause trouble. \"Over the past five years, foreign currency borrowing by firms in emerging markets has risen by about 50 per cent,\" said Ms Lagarde. \"Over the past year, bank credit has increased by 13 per cent in Latin America and 11 per cent in Asia.\" She said that developing countries needed to respond by beefing up bank supervision, restricting credit to fast-growing areas, imposing capital requirements that changed with the economic cycle and monitoring their foreign exchange exposures. Ms Lagarde endorsed quantitative easing by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan, but said that rich economies should use fiscal policy more aggressively so there was less pressure for interest rates to stay low. Countries on the mend included the US, Sweden and Switzerland, she said. But she warned that the US was cutting its deficit too fast in the short term, harming growth, but tackling its long-run deficit too slowly. She criticised sequestration under which the US is lopping off $85bn from public spending this year. \"This risks throwing away needed growth, especially at a time when too many people are still out of work,\" she said. But she said that, despite progress on fiscal policy, government debt would hit 108 per cent of gross domestic product this year. \"This is the major policy challenge facing the United States today and it must be met. Otherwise, the substantial gains that have been made can be too easily lost.\" Countries that still had work to do included the euro area and Japan, said Ms Lagarde. In the euro area, the main problem is the banking system. In keeping with the IMF's imposition of a restructuring on Cypriot banks, she said \"the priority must be to continue to clean up the banking system by recapitalising, restructuring or -- where necessary -- shutting down banks.\" In Japan, she warned that the public debt of 245 per cent of GDP \"looks increasingly unsustainable\" and that a clear plan to tackle it was an \"urgent priority\". But Japan must also act \"to finally break free of the deflation trap\" and it needed to \"rely more on monetary policy to kick-start growth\".\n### Response:", "target": "IMF chief: A three-speed global economy faces risks from a currency crisis in emerging markets .\nLagarde: Some countries doing well, some on the mend and some still in trouble .\nShe criticized sequestration under which the U.S. is lopping off $85bn from public spending .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.San Jose, California (CNN) -- A California jury Thursday acquitted a man charged with assaulting a retired Catholic priest, in a case that prosecutors had described as a vigilante attack. William Lynch, 44, was accused of confronting the Rev. Jerold Lindner, 68, during a visit at Sacred Heart Retirement home for Jesuit priests in Los Gatos, California, where Lindner had been living since retirement in 2001. Prosecutors claimed that Lynch walked into the retirement center on May 10, 2010, under the pretense of delivering news about a relative, and attacked his former pastor. Lynch and his younger brother had claimed more than a decade earlier that Lindner sexually molested them during church-led camping trips in northern California when they were 7 and 5 years old. Pennsylvania: Catholic cleric behind bars in landmark sex abuse case . During Lynch's assault trial, Lindner denied abusing the boys and maintained his innocence from the witness stand. But two days into Lindner's testimony, his attorney notified the court that his client was invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and would not testify further for fear of a perjury prosecution. Lynch also took the witness stand and testified that he only had wanted the priest to sign a confession, and he said he had punched him after experiencing an irrational fear triggered by memories of the alleged abuse. Lynch's defense attorney, Pat Harris, claimed Lindner was responsible for his client's actions. \"Society is the victim in all this ... because there's a man sitting up there at Los Gatos who is a rapist, who molests children, and he's allowed to go free,\" Harris said. The statute of limitations on criminal molestation allegations had expired when Lynch and his brother went public with their allegations in 1997. But in a civil lawsuit that was settled in 1998, Lynch and his brother asserted that Lindner sodomized them and forced them to have sex with each other while Lindner watched. In that suit, Lynch and his brother received a $625,000 settlement with the Jesuits of the California Province. In the assault case against Lynch, he faced four counts stemming from the 2010 incident. The jury Thursday acquitted him on three counts and was unable to reach a decision on the fourth charge. The judge declared a mistrial on that count, and dismissed the charge. Connecticut priest charged with possession of child porn . Dozens of Lynch supporters, including his parents, gathered with demonstration signs outside the Santa Clara County Courthouse proclaiming the defendant's innocence. Before the trial, prosecutors offered Lynch a plea deal offer that would have required a year in jail. In closing arguments, prosecutors urged the jury to refrain from being swayed by Lynch's emotional testimony describing the alleged childhood trauma he claimed to have endured at the hands of Lindner.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?\n### Input :(CNN) -- Getafe became the third Spanish football club to pass into foreign ownership on Thursday after signing a deal with Dubai's Royal Emirates Group. The Madrid-based team followed in the footsteps of Malaga and Racing Santander, which were also taken over by overseas interests in the past year. Royal Emirates Group, a conglomerate chaired by Sheikh Butti Bin Suhail Al Maktoum, has a portfolio of more than 200 companies including oil and gas, renewable energy, travel and tourism, health care, water purification, real estate & construction. The deal is worth between \u20ac70-90 million ($101-131 million) and will see the club's title rebranded to \"Getafe CF Team Dubai.\" Getafe's previous owner and president Don Angel Torres Sanchez signed over to his successors in a ceremony at Dubai's Burj Al Arab hotel on Thursday, accompanied by club captain Manu del Moral. The group said it was heavily involved in sports in the United Arab Emirates and abroad. \"The investment in Getafe CF is an evolution of this vision and an expression of renewed confidence that Dubai's businesses are more confident today to make large investments abroad as well as at home,\" Royal Emirates partner managing director Dr. Kaiser Rafiq said. \"Caring for community needs through sport is at the heart of what the Royal Emirates Group aims to achieve. This will send the positive message to the world that Dubai cares.\" Rafiq said that, being conscious of football's popularity with young Arabs, the group hoped to build a bridge between Europe and the Middle East ahead of the 2022 World Cup to be staged in Qatar. \"Royal Emirates Group plans to invest heavily in inducting new blood and promoting the team in the region,\" he said. Getafe, first formed in 1946 and refounded in 1983, has been in Spain's top flight since 2004-05. The club made a strong start to this season but hopes of qualifying for Europe have evaporated, with coach Michel's team 14th out of 20 with six matches remaining. Malaga became the first Spanish club to be bought by a foreign investor when Qatari billionaire Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani paid a reported \u20ac36 million ($52 million) in June 10. He splashed out on players and hired former Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini, but the club is battling to avoid relegation. Santander sold out to Indian businessman Ahsan Ali Syed in January, with his Western Gulf Advisory company taking over. Since replacing coach Miguel Angel Portugal with the club's former boss Marcelino, the Cantabria-based team is four points above 17th-placed Malaga.\n### Response :", "target": "Royal Emirates Group completes takeover of Spanish club Getafe .\nMadrid-based team's captain and former owner go to Dubai for official signing .\nGroup hopes to build a bridge between Europe and the Middle East .\nMalaga and Racing Santander also bought by overseas investors in the past year .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?Censorship is a part of daily life in China. News articles are erased from online search engines, social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter are banned, and CNN is routinely blacked out for Chinese viewers. Instagram was a huge hit in China -- until the government banned it during the Hong Kong protests. \"All good things must end,\" one young Chinese woman told me -- seemingly resigned to the fact that she can no longer post photos on Instagram. While such restrictions would likely incite mass outrage in many Western countries, citizens in China often have no choice but to relinquish some personal freedom as the government keeps a firm grip on certain aspects of life in this booming society. China's Communist Party will do whatever it takes to stay in power. Censorship is just one tool -- along with quickly quelling civil disobedience. Of course, China feels like a utopia of liberty when compared with the repressive North Korean regime. I distinctly remember feeling a sense of freedom and relief when landing in Beijing after a recent visit to Pyongyang. In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the average citizen has never heard of the Internet or social media. Contact with the outside world is forbidden for all but the most elite members of this reclusive society. Propaganda rules the television airwaves and fills the pages of state-run newspapers. Censorship in China . The Sony hack story has received limited news coverage in China. Stories have appeared on CCTV's newscasts and in newspapers like China Daily, though with far less prominence than some other international news outlets. In Shenyang on Tuesday, an Internet search for \"North Korea\" on China's leading (and government-controlled) search engine Baidu.com revealed a list of mostly positive articles about the DPRK. A Baidu search for \"North Korea hack\" in English revealed just one nearly two-week-old article naming the DPRK as \"one of several suspects\" in the Sony hacking investigation. An identical search on unrestricted Google on Wednesday found more than 36 million articles. When questioned by foreign reporters on Tuesday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying shied away from directly addressing the issue on the Sony hacking probe. \"We need sufficient evidence before drawing any conclusion,\" she said at a news conference, adding that the United States and North Korea should communicate. Of course, any substantive communication is unlikely given the two countries have no diplomatic ties. The Great Firewall of China . Censorship is the reality of life behind the so-called Great Firewall of China. The Ministry of Public Security has been heavily censoring content for more than a decade. The Chinese government acknowledges that the Internet is a vital tool to support the country's rapid economic growth. Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba transactions totaled nearly $250 million last year, more than Amazon and eBay combined. Alibaba's overall revenue soared 54% to over $2.7 billion in 2014. China e-commerce transactions are expected to skyrocket to more than $700 billion by 2017. But with the Internet comes the risk of sharing information that, the Chinese government worries, could destabilize the country. In China, any threat to the Communist Party's tightly clenched grip must be controlled. It's why you're likely to find very little mention of North Korea's bureau 121 in this nation suspected of having its own shadowy People's Liberation Army unit 61398 -- believed to be responsible for cyberespionage. Incidentally, the Chinese military has also denounced the United States for having its own massive cyberspying program. As all of this continues to unfold, one thing is certain: International news organizations such as CNN will continue with extensive coverage. And, thanks to heavy-handed government censors, most citizens of China will continue get only the news deemed appropriate by the government.\n### Response :", "target": "News on Sony hack is censored in China, with just a few stories that get little play .\nGovernment-controlled search engine turns up just one article on \"North Korea hack\"\nU.S. government believes N.

The video, taken from a BP gas station less than two miles from the home where Lisa was last seen, shows an unidentified person walking along the road around 2:15 a.m. October 4. The station manager, Anuj Arora, said it's unusual to see anyone walking at that time of night in the region. Arora, who shared the video with CNN on Sunday, said he also turned it over to authorities investigating Lisa's disappearance in hopes it will help in the search for the girl. The FBI and Kansas City police declined to comment on the video, citing the ongoing investigation. Meanwhile Sunday, Lisa's parents, Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin, were seen wiping away tears at the candlelight vigil outside their home. They wore T-shirts emblazoned with Lisa's image. Lisa was reported missing at 4 a.m. October 4, after Jeremy Irwin came home from work to find the door unlocked, the lights on and a window that had been tampered with. Bradley said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the night before. A cadaver dog searching the family's home indicated a positive \"hit\" for the scent of a body, according to documents released Friday. The information was included in an affidavit, dated Tuesday, police filed to request a search warrant of the home. The warrant was executed Wednesday. \"The cadaver dog indicated a positive 'hit' for the scent of a deceased human in the area of the floor of Bradley's bedroom near the bed,\" the affidavit read. It also said that interviews with people involved in the case \"revealed conflicting information\" and that Bradley told police she did not initially look for her baby behind the house because she \"was afraid of what she might find.\" The attorney for Lisa's parents said the release of the affidavit Friday was \"unfortunate,\" as it could derail the search for the missing girl. Joe Tacopina described his clients as \"very shaken up and they refuse to believe anything except that she is out there and alive.\" He said Lisa's parents are \"terrified, not for themselves, but for the welfare of their daughter.\" Bradley said in an NBC interview last week that she was drunk the night the infant disappeared and that she had last seen the baby about four hours earlier than initially reported. Bradley told NBC she is afraid she will be arrested. Police have accused her of killing Lisa, she said, and told her that she failed a lie detector test. \"I was the last one with her,\" a tearful Bradley said. \"And from judging on how the questioning went, that's kind of a fear that I have. And the main fear with that is, if they arrest me, people are going to stop looking for her. And then I'll never see her again, and I'll never know what happened.\" Asked whether he had questions about Bradley, Jeremy Irwin told NBC, \"No. There's no question to be had there. I know who she is. I know the kind of mother she is.\" Irwin said it's possible someone could have entered the house without Bradley hearing, as the couple's bedroom is on the opposite corner of the house from Lisa's room and Bradley sleeps with a fan at high speed. Lisa is described as being 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blonde hair, according to police. She weighs between 26 and 30 pounds and was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it. The missing girl has two bottom teeth and a \"beauty mark\" on her right outer thigh, police said. At the time of her disappearance, she had a cold with a cough.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?\n### Input:Los Angeles (CNN) -- Orange is the new Brown wardrobe. Chris Brown's lawyer was unable to persuade a Los Angeles judge to let the singer out of jail on Monday. Brown, 24, wore an orange jail jumpsuit at court, with his mother sitting behind him, while attorney Mark Geragos argued the singer should be allowed to enter another rehab program instead of spending the next month in jail. The singer was locked up on a probation violation warrant Friday after he was booted from a court-ordered drug rehab program. Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray said Brown has already been ejected from two rehab programs in the last five months and another program should not be considered. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin said he was concerned about a \"provocative\" statement counselors said Brown wrote on a card at the Malibu rehab center. \"I am good at using guns and knives,\" according to a document read in court. The rehab program told Brown to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations, the document said. Brown refused a drug test -- which his lawyer denied -- and he touched elbows with a female patient, according to the document. Brown's next chance to get out of jail comes on April 23 when Brandlin considers if his arrest on a misdemeanor assault charge in Washington justifies keeping him locked up. There is a possibility the judge will speed up that decision so Brown can travel to D.C. for a trial on that charge. Brown's legal troubles began five years ago, when he beat Rihanna as the two sat in a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street. He pleaded guilty to felony assault in June 2009, which resulted in a sentence of five years of probation and 1,400 hours of community labor. The judge has revoked Brown's probation twice in the past year, most recently because of his arrest on a sidewalk near the White House after he allegedly punched a man. Brown voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a Washington jail in October, but he was kicked out a few days later for \"throwing a rock through his mother's car window\" after a family session at the center, a probation report said. Brown was upset because his mother said she wanted him to stay in treatment, the report said. \"Mr. Brown proceeded to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother's car window and it shattered,\" according to a letter from the rehab center included in the probation report. His probation was revoked in November, but the judge allowed him to stay out of jail by entering a 90-day anger management and drug rehab program. Although he completed that program last month, the judge had ordered him to remain a resident at the Malibu treatment facility until a hearing on April 23. Brown's probation officer reported at a hearing last month that the singer \"continues to make great improvement\" in dealing with anger, stress and drugs, but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for the assault charge in Washington on April 17. If he is convicted in that case, the judge would decide April 23 whether Brown should complete his probation in jail. Brown has been working on a highway cleanup labor crew in Los Angeles three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements, his probation report said. At that rate, Brown could complete the labor in mid-October and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year. However, the clock is stopped while Brown is locked up.

Trade and political ties with Arizona would be \"seriously affected\", he warned. \n  \n \"Nobody can sit around with their arms crossed in the face of decisions that so clearly affect our countrymen,\" Calder\u00f3n said in a speech at the Institute for Mexicans Abroad. \n  \n His comments came as the furore over the law escalated, with calls growing in the US for a boycott of hotels, convention centres and other economic targets in Arizona. \n  \n Opponents of the legislation say it will lead to victimisation of anyone who looks or sounds Latino. Supporters say the legislation is needed because the state can no longer cope with an estimated 450,000 illegal immigrants. \n  \n The head of the Organisation of American States, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza, said: \"We consider the bill clearly discriminatory against immigrants, and especially against immigrants from Latin America.\" \n  \n The government of the Mexican state of Sonora, which sits across the border from Arizona, announced it would not attend a co-operation meeting the two states have held annually for four decades.

It has polarised opinion across the US, creating a clear divide between Democrats and Republicans. \n  \n Cleaning crews were called to the state legislative building this morning to clear swastikas daubed on it overnight. And a Democratic congressman from Arizona, Ra\u00fal Grijalva, who called for an economic boycott against \"unjust and racist\" legislation, was forced to close his office at the weekend after receiving two death threats. \n  \n Among those calling for a sweeping boycott of Arizona businesses was the San Francisco attorney, Dennis Herrera, who urged city departments to look at contracts with Arizona that could be terminated. \n  \n He said: \"Arizona has charted an ominous legal course that puts extremist politics before public safety and betrays our most deeply held American values.\" \n  \n He noted that a similar boycott 20 years ago, which included the National Football League's decision to move the Super Bowl from the state, led to Arizona dropping its refusal to recognise Martin Luther King Day. \n  \n At a rally on Sunday, Grijalva, one of Congress's leading advocates of immigration reform that would offer a route to citizenship for illegal immigrants, called for President Barack Obama to use his executive powers to block the legislation. \n  \n The sports editor of the leftwing publication the Nation, Dave Zirin, announced he would no longer write about the Arizona Diamondbacks baseball team. \"For me, they do not exist. They will continue to not exist in my mind as long as the horribly named 'Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighbourhoods Act' remains law in Arizona,\" he wrote. \n  \n The board of governors of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, based in Washington, ordered its executive to move a convention planned for this autumn from Arizona. The association president, Bernie Wolfsdorf, said: \"We cannot in good conscience spend association dollars in a state that dehumanises the people we represent and fight for.\" \n  \n The Rev Al Sharpton, an advocate of African-American rights, said in New York that he would organise \"freedom walkers\", just as the civil rights movement had organised freedom riders to board segregated buses in the 1960s. \"We will go to Arizona when this bill goes into effect and walk the streets with people who refuse to give identification and force arrest,\" Sharpton said. |||||\n### Response:", "target": "\u2013 Arizona's tough new immigration law isn't winning friends across the border: Mexican president Felipe Calder\u00f3n slammed the law in a speech last night, saying it \"opens the door to intolerance, hate, discrimination and abuse in law enforcement.\" And Mexico issued a travel advisory, warning citizens it's no longer safe to go to Arizona because the law's passage shows \"an adverse political atmosphere for migrant communities and for all Mexican visitors,\" the AP reports.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?(CNN) -- A freight train went off the rails outside Casselton, North Dakota, in the last week of December, spilling a load of crude oil and creating an impressive explosion that prompted officials to evacuate the small town. No one was hurt, but cell phone videos of the fireball were given wide exposure in the media. Here was \"an airborne toxic event,\" a phrase Don DeLillo famously used in his novel \"White Noise,\" a theatrical catastrophe born of the most quintessential American screw-up: a railroad crash. In addition to its use as shorthand for a failed government initiative or a friend who really ought to quit drinking, train wrecks occupy a contradictory place in the American cultural memory. They are as much celebrated as they are feared, and frequently memorialized in art and song. One of the most celebrated martyrs in American history, for example -- Casey Jones -- lost his life while trying to limit casualties in a 1900 smash-up on the Illinois Central. But beneath the morbid romanticism lies a historical home truth about train wrecks -- it took a little while before the most spectacular and shocking of them resulted in enough popular outrage to spur by real legislative action to make the rails safer. And so today an incident such as Casselton draws attention, with the help of dramatic TV images, to the enormous amount of oil being shipped on American rails and the inadequacy of current tank-car designs. It was different before mass media, and not every crash was galvanizing. Wrecks were all too common on early American rails, mainly because the tracks were constructed so badly. The merchant barons of Baltimore and Philadelphia were in a rush to get their lines over the Appalachians and into the fertile grain country of the Middle West during the 1830s. Crews grew accustomed to laying warped wooden ties and low-quality iron, and breakneck curves were common in the mountains. Signaling was also primitive, which meant that collisions -- euphemistically called \"cornfield meets\" -- were another cost of doing business. Perhaps because they involved an exciting new technology -- the railroad was the first true \"machine\" of the steam era to see widespread use -- or perhaps because the crashes were so messy and difficult to clean up (a combination of jacks, ramps and pulleys were often necessary to rerail cars), train wrecks came to assume a mythic stature and even a nobility that a later generation of car and plane mishaps would never touch. When engineer Casey Jones hit the brakes on his speeding Illinois Central locomotive instead of jumping in 1900, he died in the crash but became the subject of an enormously popular ballad and an oral legend that he died with the throttle puncturing his heart and a halo of spilled corn around his head. Songs such as \"The Wreck of the Old 97\" and \"Wreck of the Royal Palm\" became beloved standards. There were no stirring ballads to be drawn out of a horrendous train caught fire in Angola, New York, in 1867 that burned 49 people to death. The result was that carriages would no longer be made of wood and track gauges were standardized throughout the country, a turning point for cars and rails. And in New York City's Park Avenue was torn up and Grand Central Depot was completely rebuilt after a wreck in the tunnels killed 15 people in 1902. The Long Island Rail Road installed automatic speed control on its system after a crash near Richmond Hill, in Queens, in 1950 killed 78 commuters and triggered the threat of a boycott by frightened Long Island riders. And Southern California's Metrolink began an accelerated program to install a GPS-based safety system called positive train control after a 2008 wreck in which the driver blew through a stop signal because he was texting on his phone. Likewise, the deadly crash of a Metro North train north of New York City in December has raised the urgency of a 2015 federal deadline for railroads to install positive train control. Wrecks have so fascinated and horrified the public since the early days of train travel that perhaps it is no surprise that America's first corporate public relations department was created by the Pennsylvania Railroad after one of its trains plunged into a creek near Atlantic City in 1906, killing 53 passengers. Last week's derailment in North Dakota has already raised questions about just how much oil is now being shipped by rail in America. The answer: a lot. Almost all of North Dakota's considerable production of oil is shipped by rail, and train cars carrying petroleum went from about 10,000 in 2009 to an estimated 400,000 by the end of this year. This signals a revival of a hauling practice not widely used since the 1860s, and has spurred calls to toughen federal design standards for the DOT-111 type of tank car that is most often used to transport oil. Unlike other transforming rail crashes in American history, nobody died or was even hurt in the Casselton incident. It would be a major step forward -- perhaps even worthy of myth -- if this bloodless wreck on the prairie is what it took to bring us better oil cars on American tracks.

Although the Department of Defense (DoD) had \"internal processes and controls\" to track payments, the \"bulk of the records are missing,\" the report says, adding that the department is searching for them. Other documents are missing as well, including monthly reports documenting expenses, the audit says. \"From July 2004 through December 2007, DoD should have provided 42 monthly reports. However, it can locate only the first four reports.\" A letter accompanying the report is signed by Stuart Bowen, the inspector general. The audit was overseen by Glenn Furbish, assistant inspector general for audits. In a response letter also contained in the report, Defense Under Secretary Mark Easton acknowledges \"a records management issue.\" The audit says it believes records management is to blame, and \"has been an ongoing problem for DoD in Iraq. By all accounts, DoD established good internal processes and controls to account for and report on\" the funds it was given after the Coalition Provisional Authority dissolved. Where the records did exist, they matched other records and contained \"good financial documentation supporting individual payments.\" Also, there is \"sufficient evidence\" that required monthly reports were sent to the government of Iraq, even though they can't be found, the audit said. The audit deals with a time when Iraq's government was undergoing a transition. The Coalition Provisional Authority ran the country for 14 months from 2003 to 2004. During that time, the authority awarded numerous contracts. When it dissolved in 2004, the Iraqi government gave the U.S. Defense Department access to the $3 billion to pay bills for contracts the provisional authority had awarded. The Defense Department letter from Easton -- the department's deputy chief financial officer -- thanks the inspector general's office for \"the collaborative effort and professional courtesy\" in a series of audits. Separately, the inspector general's office sent a letter Sunday to the U.S. ambassador to Iraq complaining that the U.S. government is not providing Iraq with a complete list of reconstruction projects. The U.S. criteria for selecting which projects to report to Iraq -- which include only those valued at $250,000 or more -- is a central part of the problem, the letter says. The U.S. Embassy says the system is designed to help Iraq \"focus its limited resources on sustainment of infrastructure and other large capital projects done through U.S. reconstruction efforts,\" the report notes. The inspector general's office argues that the limited list -- which is also \"hampered by unreliable data and other data entry problems\" -- does not allow Iraq to decide where to focus its resources, and notes that the country might consider some smaller projects more important than those that are reported. \"Without more comprehensive knowledge about reconstruction projects the (Iraqi government) will not be in a position to maximize the use of its resources,\" the report says. Billions of dollars in spending are not reported to Iraq under the current system, the report says. In a response letter, Peter Bodde, assistant chief of mission for the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, says that while the current system is incomplete, \"it does capture the vast majority of reconstruction projects and there is no other alternative that captures more.\" He also notes that the Iraq reconstruction effort \"is now in its very last stages, and all remaining capital projects will be reported through the asset transfer process.\" The Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction was created in 2004 to continue oversight of Iraq reconstruction programs.\n### Response : ", "target": "NEW: The U.S. is keeping Iraq out of the loop on some projects, report says .\nNEW: The U.S. Embassy in Iraq disagrees with that complaint .\nThe Defense Department can't account for about $2 billion in past spending, report says .\nThe department acknowledges a \"records management issue\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Given the following news article, summarize the article:(CNN) -- Sepp Blatter has told CNN that his main aim in his fourth and final term as FIFA president is to restore the battered credibility of world football's governing body. The 75-year-old was re-elected unopposed as head of the organization on June 1 after the only other candidate, Asian Federation chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, pulled out of the race before being provisionally suspended by FIFA over bribery allegations. The vote drew widespread criticism as Blatter received 186 votes from football's 208 member associations, with critics saying it should not have gone ahead until the investigation into Hammam and FIFA vice-president Jack Warner -- who was also subject to suspension -- had been completed. \"I have said 'zero tolerance' is one thing, but I have also said the social and cultural implementation of football is important -- but now it's to rebuild the image of FIFA, that's number one, and I have already started,\" Blatter told CNN in his first sit-down interview since the election. Never mind Saint Sepp, the system is to blame . \"We are now somewhere where football needs a little bit more credibility because we came building up football, bringing so much money in to this game. \"Automatically a lot of devils came in to the game and now we are in a situation where we have to go forward and we have to cut all these allegations, criticism, whatever. We can't do it in one day, but we will do it.\" Blatter -- who described his election win as \"the title without glory\" and called the ruling body \"my FIFA\" -- ruled out blanket life bans for any FIFA member found guilty of corruption. \"It's not a killing instinct that we have to kill people! Zero tolerance means that if you commit something outside the play of field, you will have a punishment,\" the Swiss administrator said. \"But it can be a yellow card, it can be a red card, it can be a suspension for two games, three games ... lifetime.\" Maradona attacks 'corrupt' FIFA chiefs . Despite recent turmoil and opposition to Blatter in the race for the presidency, the Swiss insisted that both Hammam and Warner were longtime friends who remain on good terms. \"We are friends, but friends going together when it is in the interest of some of the people. For me, going together with people it's only for the interest of FIFA because I have represented FIFA for 36 years -- it's my FIFA,\" Blatter said. Warner has since backed down, for legal reasons, on threats to release \"a football tsunami\" by making public his email correspondence with Blatter. \"This is a question of character. If you have a problem inside your family you are not going to disclose if there is anything to be disclosed to the public,\" Blatter said. \"But I don't know what he means by the tsunami! It's easy to say, it's like allegations made by (England's former 2018 bid leader) Lord Triesman -- these are allegations and there is no evidence, so if somebody says it's a tsunami, you know there are also very little tsunamis.\" Blatter commits to 'change' after winning FIFA's presidential vote . Blatter said he would not open an investigation into the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar -- Hammam's native country, which has been accused of bribing delegates ahead of last December's controversial vote -- unless his proposed new \"solutions committee\" or FIFA's existing ethics panel recommended such a probe. FIFA's own secretary general Jerome Valcke wrote an email suggesting that Qatar's financial clout had been behind its success. \"Let me work now on this new approach of the ethics committee, let me work with this committee of solutions. And if this committee of solutions or the ethics committee have the impression that they should do something then let them take the decisions,\" Blatter said. Blatter has vowed to bring in a panel of experts to form the solutions committee and help address FIFA's problems, including 88-year-old former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Dutch football legend Johan Cruyff, 64, and 70-year-old opera great Placido Domingo. \"These gentlemen are more or less advisers. They are not the experts but advisers, and what they should be also is the kind of council of wisdom -- which my Executive Committee would not like because they think they are the council of wisdom,\" Blatter said. \"Placido Domingo will be part -- he is happy, he is proud that he is part -- as Kissinger also! People say he (Kissinger) is an old man, but he is a wise man.\" The solutions committee will be chaired by a FIFA official, with Blatter dismissing suggestions that it should be an entirely independent body. \"The football family has asked me to solve the solution inside FIFA and not outside FIFA,\" he said. \"And if we have to go and open our borders and say everyone can come in ... we are a very organized institution with 208 associations, six continents. I've put already zero tolerance in the agenda!\"\n### Response : ", "target": "Sepp Blatter admits that FIFA's reputation has been tainted by recent scandals .\nPresident says FIFA's financial wealth has brought in \"a lot of devils\"\nBut he rules out blanket life bans for any FIFA members guilty of corruption .\nHenry Kissinger and Placido Domingo to form part of new \"solutions committee\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction: What's the main idea?(CNN) -- Google rolled out a new Nexus 7 tablet on Wednesday. But a much smaller, much cheaper new gadget may be the one that makes a seismic impact in the consumer technology world. Chromecast is a glorified thumb drive that enables Web streaming to television. At $35, it's also practically free, considering that it comes packed with three free months of Netflix. Streaming media onto the (relatively) big screen is nothing new. Set-top boxes like Roku and Boxee have provided the service, at least in part, for years. More recently, Google's now-defunct Nexus Q has battled Apple TV for the hearts and minds of consumers who have grown used to on-demand video on their laptops, tablets and even phones. With Chromecast, though, Google appears to have stripped down Web streaming to its purest elements. \"It looks like they have learned from their mistakes, and radically simplified the experience,\" Janko Roettgers wrote for tech blog GigaOM. \"Gone are the attempts to integrate existing pay-TV offerings, recruit app developers for yet another medium and ship devices with hideous, complicated remote controls. \"Instead, Chromecast is pure simplicity: Search and discovery of video content is happening on the mobile device or laptop, and all Chromecast does is stream media from the cloud.\" Google and Apple have both tried and, at least so far, largely failed to make inroads into the living room with streaming TV products. Google TV struggled to get some major content providers to play ball. And Apple CEO Tim Cook has acknowledged that Apple TV has languished as more of a novelty for diehard fans than a mass-market success. (A full-on Apple TV set, which has been the tech world's most-anticipated piece of rumored vaporware for the past couple of years, could of course change that). Those products, along with Roku, Boxee and the like, have been, in a way, similar to traditional TV. Approved \"channels,\" chiefly Netflix, Amazon and other Web video services, are available. But Chromecast takes streaming to a whole new level -- offering a quick, simple version of what tech-inclined folks have been able to accomplish by rigging up their laptops or desktops with their TVs. Essentially, if you can watch it on a computer, tablet or phone screen, you'll be able to watch it on your TV. That's the logical end goal of Web streaming, and many analysts are saying Google struck a huge blow by being the first to offer it up in a way that the typical consumer can understand and use. \"By coming out early at an extremely affordable price, Google may wind up dominating the TV delivery industry,\" consumer tech analyst Larry Magid wrote for Forbes. \"It's hard to imagine that Hulu, Major League Baseball, HBO Go and every other content provider isn't beating a path to their door. I imagine that the TV networks, too, are anxious to get their content on the device.\" Early interest in the 2-inch gadget appears to be high. Thursday afternoon, Chromecast was listed as out of stock on Amazon and Best Buy's website. The Google Play store was accepting orders, saying the device would be shipped in 3-4 weeks. While deals with the TV networks seem inevitable, Chromecast also could allow Google to make deals directly with content providers, in much the way Netflix has with original programs like Emmy-nominated \"House of Cards\" and a revived \"Arrested Development.\" Web TV services like Hulu have thus far tried to limit their basic service to computer screens, offering the ability to stream to television for extra money. Now, Hulu says it's working with Google to offer an \"optimized\" version on Chromecast. How Chromecast will impact Google's battle with Apple remains to be seen. The existing Apple TV product, with its Airplay feature that streams from the Web, has its devotees. But it only works with Apple products, naturally. Chromecast is designed to work on any platform that can run its Chrome browser. So a user could, for example, stream a YouTube video from an iPad, then watch a Netflix movie from a PC -- all streamed on a TV set through a Google device. \"On paper at least, it's the best device Google has ever announced ...,\" Mat Honan wrote for WIRED, a CNN.com content partner. \"Did Google just win the living room? No. But it definitely just cozied up on a lot of couches and got comfortable.\"\n### Response: ", "target": "Google's Chromecast could be a TV game changer, analysts say .\nThe Web streaming device costs $35 and plugs into TVs .\nIts simplicity is the key, some say .\nHow Chromecast will affect the TV battle with Apple remains to be seen .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The former member of the Eurythmics, famous for songs such as \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" and solo hits including \"Walking on Broken Glass,\" was honored for her work fighting AIDS and poverty in Africa. Lennox is one of 997 people on the 2011 New Year Honors List, which is released every Dec. 31 and recognizes outstanding achievement and service. Other big names on the list include actors David Suchet, known for his portrayal of Agatha Christie's detective Hercule Poirot, and Sheila Hancock, a famous face on British stage and screen. Both received a CBE, which stands for Commander of the Order of the British Empire, the highest honor below a knight or dame. A CBE also went to Trevor Horn, the record producer behind some of pop music's biggest hits from the 1970s to the present day. His extensive discography ranges from \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" by the Buggles, \"Relax\" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood, and Band Aid's \"Do They Know it's Christmas?\" to Seal's \"Kiss from a Rose\" and albums from Charlotte Church and John Legend. Fashion designer Katherine Hamnett, famous for her 1980s slogan T-shirts with phrases such as \"Choose Life\" and \"Stay Alive in 85,\" also received a CBE. The co-founders of Lush Cosmetics, Margaret and Mark Constantine, received OBEs, which stands for Order of the British Empire, the next-highest honor. Their business began in a shed in their garden and has since grown to become a well known brand with more than 600 stores in 43 countries. Far from being big names, 74% of the recipients are local heroes, honored for outstanding work in their communities. They include a beekeeper, a driving instructor for people with special needs, an equine physiotherapist, and a woman who has coached girl's athletics for 60 years. The bridgemaster at London's Tower Bridge, Erick Sutherns, received an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire. An MBE also went to John Mackay, who has worked as a postman for 44 years in Caithness, described as one of the most challenging delivery routes in the Highlands of Scotland. A founding member of the first gay men's soccer team in Britain also received an MBE. Aslie Pitter was recognized for making an enormous impact in tackling homophobia through sports in his role at the club. Golfer Graeme McDowell, the 2010 U.S. Open winner and member of the victorious European Ryder Cup Team, received an MBE. Former World Cup-winning rugby player Mike Catt, now a rugby coach, received an OBE. Among those receiving the highest honor of a knighthood was Martin Broughton, chairman of British Airways, recognized as an outstanding business leader with a strong track record of service to the wider community.

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.LONDON, England (CNN) -- The \"crime scene cookies\", \"baaji custard\" and \"sponge shafts\" depicted in Oliver Beale's letter of complaint to Virgin Atlantic struck a chord worldwide. Mean cuisine? Airline industry experts insist standards of in-flight food are improving. The missive he sent to Virgin chairman Sir Richard Branson about a meal he received on board a Virgin flight from Mumbai to London in December spread across the web and email with a vengeance. Not only was this a complaint letter par excellence, but it hit upon one of the most emotive subjects of long-haul air travel: the in-flight meal. Read the letter here. \"Food gets everybody going, whether they are sitting at the back end or the front end of the plane,\" says Peter Miller, marketing director at Skytrax, a UK-based aviation research organization. \"Apart from the sheer fact you might be hungry, it is there to alleviate the boredom. Because of that people tend to focus on it more.\" But the criticism passengers target at airline food is not always warranted, Miller argues. Skytrax has been tracking airline service for a decade and every year it ranks airlines according to catering in economy, business and first class. Miller acknowledges that there have been cut backs on catering across short-haul flights and a decline in spending on food in long-haul economy. But Skytrax's research has also revealed a general improvement in standards over the last five years. \"We are actually strong supporters of the overall quality that is served up across most airlines in most parts of the world,\" says Miller. Standards have improved firstly as a result of greater competition between airline catering companies, says Miller. What do you think? Are in-flight meals getting better or worse? What was your worse meal? Sound off below. Austrian catering company DO & CO has transformed the food served onboard Austrian Airlines and Turkish Airlines flights. Skytrax reported a 35 percent increase in customer satisfaction for Turkish Airlines since DO & CO was hired in 2007. \"In the last 15-20 years, the industry has focused on lean production. But we believe [airline catering] is not the job of a car manufacturer,\" says Attila Dogudan, CEO of DO & CO. Good quality airline food not only depends on the quality of raw ingredients, he says, but also the intangible elements of good cuisine. \"If you have chefs doing 3,000 filets on the grill, after 300 they lose the passion,\" says Dogudan. To inspire enthusiasm in its kitchens, DO & CO says it employs an unusually high ratio of chefs to work on a greater variety of dishes. They say they also insist on training cabin staff in food service; they replace the dreaded disposable food trays with crockery; and give passengers menus explaining where their fresh, local ingredients come from. Airlines also use food as a marketing tool and improve standards to attract premium customers. Austrian Airlines has won the Skytrax award for Best Business Class Catering for the last two years. As Michael Braun, spokesman at Austrian Airlines says, \"the current situation in the airline industry is tough and costs have to be cut. But the competition is also very tough, so we need something that makes us unique compared to other airlines.\" And for Austrian Airlines, one unique selling point is its food. There is an on-board chef on every Austrian Airlines flight who puts the crucial finishing touches on premium-class meals. The airline also offers a \"Vienna coffee house in the air\" and one quarter of flight attendants are trained sommeliers to guide passengers through the extensive wine list. Airlines worldwide also hire celebrity chefs to add prestige to their culinary efforts. British chef, Gordon Ramsay is one of Singapore Airline's \"Culinary Panel\"; Juan Amador works with Lufthansa; and United Airlines enlisted the services of U.S. chef Charlie Trotter to inspire its in-flight menu. Chefs help airlines design meals that perform at high altitude. As Michelle Bernstein, Delta's celebrity chef has said, palates weaken in pressurized air cabins, which means dishes need to be made a more flavorful and seasoned than they would be on the ground. Miller at SkyTrax is skeptical about the true benefits a celebrity chef can bring to onboard catering. After all, Gordon Ramsay isn't actually in the cabin saut\u00e9ing the potatoes. But he does acknowledge that some chefs have influenced a new style of in-flight cuisine. Chef Neil Perry, hired by Qantas in 2003, initiated a move to healthy eating in first and business class. His work has since influenced standards across catering in all classes. Qantas won the Skytrax award for Best Economy Class Catering in 2008 partly as a result of simple enhancements such as the availability of fresh fruit between meals and from the self-serve bar in economy on its A380 aircraft. But as airlines grapple with a deepening recession, can passengers expect treats to vanish from food trays? Across short-haul flights, making cuts is an \"easier game,\" says Miller. Passengers notice it far less if an airline switches a sandwich for a packet of biscuits and a plastic cup of coffee, he says. But on long-haul flights, airlines are restrained in what they can cut. Miller: \"People measure the standard of their flight by the quality of the food or the size of the portion they get. If a meal is cut back too severely they are going to walk away.\" How important is food for you on flights? Is it good enough? Sound off below.\n### Response:", "target": "In-flight food has been the butt of much criticism for the airline industry .\nIndustry experts say quality is improving despite some budget cutbacks .\nAirline food is back in focus after a six-page rant from a Virgin passenger .\nThe complaint letter referred to the passenger's \"culinary journey of hell\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?\n### Input :(CNN) -- A California police officer won his appeal Monday at the Supreme Court, after being sued for chasing a suspect onto private property without a warrant. At issue is whether a homeowner's \"expectation of privacy\" was violated, since there was no \"immediate danger\" to law enforcement and the alleged offense -- disobeying the police -- was a misdemeanor. The justices said Officer Mike Stanton of the La Mesa Police Department had \"qualified immunity\" from civil claims of unreasonable search and seizure. \"There is no suggestion in this case that Officer Stanton knowingly violated the Constitution,\" specifically the Fourth Amendment, said the unsigned opinion from the high court. \"Stanton may have been mistaken in believing his actions were justified, but he was not 'plainly incompetent.' \" Judges generally give wide latitude in justifying police chases involving felonies and use of weapons, but in cases where the circumstances are less clear, there can be tricky legal questions like those presented here. The incident happened in May 2008, in a neighborhood east of San Diego that lower courts had said was known for \"violence associated with drug gangs.\" Stanton and his partner responded to a 911 call about an \"unknown disturbance\" concerning a person with a baseball bat. The officers arrived in their marked vehicle, saw three people and ordered them to stop. One of the men, who carried no noticeable weapon, ran into a nearby fenced residential yard. Stanton pursued, and believing the suspect had committed a misdemeanor, made the \"split-second\" decision to kick open a 6-foot-high gate. The owner of the property, Drendolyn Sims, happened to be on the other side of the gate and was struck when it flew inward, cutting her forehead and injuring her shoulder. Sims sued in federal court, alleging the officer invaded her home without a warrant. A judge agreed with the officer, saying the situation was potentially dangerous, Stanton \"feared for his safety\" and he was justified going after the fleeing suspect. But a federal appeals court in San Francisco found for Sims, allowing the lawsuit to proceed. Now, the high court has reversed, saying previous rulings made clear that Stanton deserved immunity from civil claims. The conservative majority court in recent years has given the benefit of the doubt to law enforcement in a number of cases involving searches of private property. \"Stanton was in hot pursuit of\" the suspect, said the high court. \"He did see (the suspect) enter Sims' property, and he had every reason to believe that the suspect was just beyond Sims' gate.\" The issue was thrown back to the lower courts to be sorted out, after the Supreme Court's conclusions, and could lead to the lawsuit's final dismissal. The case is Stanton v. Sims (12-1217).\n### Response:", "target": "A California homeowner sued police after an officer chased a suspect onto her property .\nShe says the officer invaded her home without a warrant, but a judge sided with the officer .\nOn appeal, a federal court found for the homeowner, allowing the lawsuit to proceed .\nThe U.S. Supreme Court sides with the officer, citing his \"qualified immunity\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

It will do little for Benitez's popularity with many Chelsea supporters still angry at the removal of Di Matteo and the arrival of the former Liverpool manager. \"A lot of things went wrong today,\" Benitez told reporters. \"We knew we were playing against the bottom of the table side and we spoke about that. \"We knew we had to be focused but we did not have the tempo and some players may have been tired. \"It was going wrong against a side who played deep and were organized.\" This was supposed to be a routine victory for Chelsea against a Rangers side which had managed just one league victory all season.

The home side were fortunate not to be reduced to ten men on four minutes when Marko Marin threw himself into a wild and dangerous challenge on Stephane Mbia. The Germany winger was shown only a yellow card for the tackle, which could easily have resulted in a straight red. While Chelsea had plenty of possession and worked goalkeeper Julio Cesar on a couple of occasions, the home side was unable to muster that moment of magic to claim the lead. Lampard double inspires Chelsea . Lampard thought he had put his side ahead on 66 minutes only for his effort to be ruled out for offside. Chelsea's failure to turn possession into goals allowed their opponent to grow in confidence. Suddenly, QPR began to look dangerous on the counter-attack, soaking up pressure before pushing forward in search of an unlikely winner. That winner did eventually come with 12 minutes remaining and when it arrived, it was provided by a man who used to wear the Chelsea blue. Shaun Wright-Phillips, who spent three years with the club between 2005-2008, showed his former employers how to finish, slamming home from 20-yards to send shockwaves around Stamford Bridge. The result leaves QPR five points adrift of safety with league games against Tottenham, West Ham and Manchester City to come this month. Quite what Chelsea's prospective signing Demba Ba thought of the team's performance is unknown, but with the Newcastle striker sat in the stands, the Blues flattered to deceive. While Ba was busy watching Chelsea, Newcastle was suffering a 2-1 home defeat by Everton. Papiss Cisse had given Newcastle a second minute lead before Leighton Baines' stunning free-kick and Victor Anichebe's strike won it for Everton. David Moyes' side are now just two points behind fourth place Chelsea, while Newcastle sits two points above the relegation zone. Chelsea striker Sturridge joins Liverpool . Elsewhere, Liverpool cruised to a 3-0 win over Sunderland thanks to two goals from Luis Suarez. The Uruguay international took his tally to 15 Premier League goals for the season with Raheem Sterling having opened the scoring on 19 minutes. Liverpool, which completed the $19.6 million signing of Chelsea striker Daniel Sturridge Wednesday, now sits eighth in the table. Manager Brendan Rodgers also confirmed that midfielder Joe Cole is holding talks with former club West Ham after enduring an unsuccessful spell at Anfield. He told reporters: \"I spoke to Joe earlier. He is a really good lad and has been brilliant during my time here in terms of as a human being. \"He is obviously speaking with West Ham at the moment and if they can get something organised, it will be a terrific move for Joe.\"\n### Response:", "target": "Chelsea loses at home against bottom of table Queens Park Rangers .\nFormer Chelsea player Shaun Wright-Phillips scores only goal of the game .\nLuis Suarez scores twice as Liverpool wins 3-0 .\nEverton comes from behind to defeat Newcastle 2-1 .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?(CNN) -- Chelsea have closed the gap on leaders Manchester United at the top of the English Premier League after a John Terry header and a Frank Lampard double gave them a comfortable 3-1 win at Blackpool on Monday. Terry was left unmarked to nod home Lampard's 20th minute corner to put the defending champions on their way to a second victory in a week -- following last Tuesday's 2-1 home success over United. Blackpool were unlucky not to level before half-time when midfielder Jason Puncheon's fierce low drive was tipped onto the post by goalkeeper Petr Cech. But Lampard doubled the advantage just past the hour mark when he converted from the penalty spot after substitute Salomon Kalou was tripped in the area by defender Ian Evatt. And the England midfielder was on hand again four minutes later when he slid the ball home after Kalou's pass had split Blackpool's defence wide open. But Blackpool continued to battle away and they scored a late consolation goal when Puncheon found the corner of the net after being set-up by James Beattie. The result means Chelsea stay in fourth place, nine points behind United although they do have a game in hand. However, Blackpool remain in relegation trouble and they lie in 15th place, just two points and three positions above the relegation zone. Meanwhile, in Spain's Primera Liga, Deportivo La Coruna beat Real Sociedad 2-1 to improve their chance of avoiding relegation.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you briefly describe the text?(Health.com) -- A popular pain-relief treatment that uses electricity to stimulate nerves isn't likely to benefit the millions of Americans who live with chronic low back pain and shouldn't be recommended for that purpose, new guidelines say. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, or TENS, is delivered using a small battery-operated generator connected to a set of electrodes. The generator, about the size of a BlackBerry, transmits a weak electric current through the electrodes, which are attached to the skin at the site of chronic pain or at other key points. Despite their popularity, there is little evidence that these devices are effective for chronic low back pain, according to the guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology, which were published Wednesday in the journal Neurology. \"Physicians are advised against ordering TENS for patients with chronic low back pain since it is proven not to work,\" says the lead author of the guidelines, Richard Dubinsky, M.D., a professor of neurology at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas. Health.com: How yoga can relieve back pain . Dubinsky and his colleague based the guidelines on a review of past studies that compared TENS with a sham TENS procedure (a mock treatment equivalent to a placebo) for chronic low back pain, which is defined as pain lasting three months or more. They turned up just five studies in all. Two high-quality studies found that TENS produced no benefit; the other studies had mixed results, but they were considered to be less reliable. Health.com: All the right moves to avoid back pain . The relative dearth of research on TENS and chronic low back pain suggests that the new guidelines shouldn't be accepted as gospel, according to Andreas Binder, M.D., and Ralf Baron, M.D., neurologists at Christian-Albrecht-Universit\u00e4t Kiel, in Kiel, Germany, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new guidelines. \"[A]bsence of evidence is not evidence of absence,\" they wrote. Although the research on TENS may be thin, they added, \"there seems to be considerable empirical evidence that, at least in some patients, TENS is useful.\" Binder and Baron point out that, unlike opiates and other pain medications -- which carry a risk of side effects, including abuse and addiction -- TENS is a safe, fast-acting, and user-friendly treatment that has very few side effects, doesn't interact with medications, and can be stopped at any time if it isn't effective. Health.com: Is chronic pain ruining your relationship? The treatment is also relatively affordable. TENS units can be purchased for less than $100, although some models cost several hundred dollars or more. There certainly is a market for the devices. Back pain is the second most common cause of disability in the U.S. after arthritis, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Eight out of 10 adults will experience low back pain at some point in their lives by some estimates, although 95 percent of those cases will get better within three months. Charles Cranny, the director of outpatient physical therapy at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, says that because of the treatment's upside, TENS may still be worth recommending to patients with chronic back pain for whom other treatments have come up short. \"We use TENS as a last resort in people with chronic back pain who are not improving with other measures,\" he says. \"I say, let's give it a try in these patients. We have had some who swear by it and a lot who say, 'It worked for a couple of weeks, but then I returned it to the vendor.'\" Health.com: 5 natural fixes for back pain . Exactly how TENS works -- or whether it does work -- isn't known. Experts believe that the electrical current may overstimulate the nerves that sense pain, confusing the brain in the process and blocking out the real pain signals. \"TENS likely has a placebo effect, but its safety and side effect profile makes it an ideal tool in approaching chronic pain syndromes,\" says Derk Krieger, M.D., Ph.D., a neurologist at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. In contrast to the findings on low back pain, the new guidelines state that TENS may be useful in treating nerve pain associated with diabetes, which affects up to 70 percent of people with the disease. Two studies have found that TENS has some positive effects on diabetic nerve pain, but because neither of them compared TENS with any other treatment options, it remains unclear when TENS is most appropriate to use in such cases, the guidelines say. Health.com: Diet tips for pain patients . \"No recommendations can be made about when to use TENS compared to other treatments for diabetic nerve pain,\" says Dubinsky. Cranny says that, in his experience, TENS has indeed proven effective for diabetic nerve pain. \"This is a whole different type of pain than typical low back pain, and my patients with diabetic nerve pain swear by it,\" he says. \"If they don't use TENS they will have a bad day, and if they do use it they will feel better.\" In the new guidelines,  Dubinsky and his colleague call for more studies of TENS, particularly in people who have never used the devices before. Future studies should also try to determine the optimal way to administer TENS, they write. In the meantime, says Cranny -- and the new guidelines notwithstanding -- patients have little reason not to try TENS. \"Try it, see if it works; if it doesn't, return it,\" he says. \"It's worth a shot, because there aren't too many significant side effects.\" Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .\n### Response: ", "target": "Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation doesn't help back pain, study finds .\nTENS transmits weak electric current through electrodes at pain site .\nOther experts say research is insufficient to completely dismiss TENS' value .\nBack pain is the second most common cause of disability in the U.S. after arthritis .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?(CNN) -- Funny thing about fish: You can see right through them in their infancy and watch their organs develop. That gave scientists looking into the aftereffects of 2010's Gulf of Mexico oil spill the chance to watch the growing hearts of large commercial species like tuna and amberjack after exposing them in laboratories to oil collected from the undersea blowout. The results ranged from abnormal heartbeats in fish exposed to low concentrations of oil to \"severely malformed and malfunctioning hearts\" at high levels, said John Incardona, an environmental toxicologist from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Incardona is the lead author of a NOAA-led study published Monday that warned those heart defects could lead to widespread losses of popular deep-sea fish in the gulf. He and his colleagues exposed bluefin tuna, yellowfin tuna and amberjack embryos to concentrations of oil \"that mimicked what happened in the Gulf of Mexico,\" he said. Even where the volatile compounds in oil made up as little as one millionth of a gram per liter, some fish ended up with heart problems, they reported. \"Those fish would in all likelihood survive the immediate effects of oil exposure, but would also probably end up with a milder heart malformation that could reduce their aerobic performance -- which for fish, means swimming,\" Incardona said. Fishermen hauled in more than 1,500 tons of tuna and amberjack across the gulf in 2012, according to NOAA catch statistics. Scientists have already tracked a sharp decline in bluefin tuna, but the findings may spell trouble for other big fish as well, Incardona and his colleagues reported. How extensive any losses may be is still under study, but estimates may come \"in a few months,\" said Barbara Block, a Stanford University biologist and co-author of Monday's study. The spill struck at a time when fish were spawning, with their embryos and larvae floating on the surface of the gulf. Since bluefin tuna in particular take eight years or more to grow up, the \"the trickle-down impact of this oil spill will take a long time to manifest upon the population on a level that one could see,\" Block said. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on the 25th anniversary of what had been the worst U.S. oil spill -- the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska. It's one of the \"key studies\" commissioned by the federal government to gauge the damage left behind by the Deepwater Horizon disaster, NOAA official Tom Brosnan said. \"It's one of the most difficult aspects of this oil spill to the particular population that we're talking about,\" Block said. But since bluefin have been extensively tagged electronically, both before and after the spill, \"those data sets exist, and they're currently being explored to get answers to those questions.\" Millions of barrels of crude poured into the gulf after the April 2010 explosion that sank the drill rig Deepwater Horizon off Louisiana and killed 11 workers. Well owner BP has already paid $43 billion in cleanup, restoration costs and fines for the 2010 blowout, and an ongoing federal court case in New Orleans could add several billion more on top of that. BP immediately disputed Monday's findings. \"The paper provides no evidence to suggest a population-level impact on tuna, amberjack or other pelagic fish species in the Gulf of Mexico,\" the company said in a written statement. \"The oil concentrations used in these lab experiments were rarely seen in the gulf during or after the Deepwater Horizon accident. In addition, the authors themselves note that it is nearly impossible to determine the early life impact to these species. To overcome this challenge, it would take more information than what's presented in this paper.\" But Fernando Galvez, an environmental toxicologist at Louisiana State University, said the samples to which the embryos were exposed were \"environmentally realistic.\" The effects seen in individual fish \"have very strong indications for population-level impacts,\" he said. \"You mess up the heart, you mess up the ability of species like this to do simple functions like swim to catch its prey,\" said Galvez, the co-author of a 2013 study that pointed to similar problems among fish in coastal marshes hit by oil.

{"source": "### Instruction:Produce an article summary of the following news article:Doc to summarize:Egypt's new temporary government began to take shape on Sunday, with reformer and Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei sworn in as the country's interim vice president for foreign relations. Nabil Fahmy, former Egyptian ambassador to the United States, accepted the post of foreign minister, he told CNN. Ahmed Galal, a liberal economist educated in the United States and a World Bank veteran, has been appointed as finance minister, and Hisham Zaazou will retain his post as tourism minister, the state-run MENA news agency said. These are key first steps in establishing a civilian governance, after the military overthrew President Mohammed Morsy in a coup early this month. And it's the first phase of a transition that is expected to usher in presidential elections next year. Ruling authorities are focused on choosing technocrats -- nonpolitical people with expertise in particular fields -- who will help bring back efficient governance and foster a functioning economy. Critics of Morsy's government have decried what they said was rife administrative incompetence and political cronyism during the ousted president's administration -- dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood and its political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party. A reason for staging the coup was offered in a statement from Egypt's top military officer, Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi. In a statement posted on the military's Facebook site Sunday, he said that the armed forces decided to side with \"the people\" against the Morsy government when the president refused a demand for a referendum that would authorize a new presidential election. \"The people were worried that the state and its tools will be used against their rights, and therefore, the armed forces had to confirm the legitimacy of the people and help them restore their inherent rights to choose and decide, and that is what we did,\" the statement said. Morsy, Muslim Brotherhood face probe . A technocracy in the making . The choices represent a change in direction, away from the Islamist bent of the Morsy government. ElBaradei -- who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work as director general of the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency -- and the others are people with whom Western governments have been comfortable. The head of the IAEA from 1997 to 2009, ElBaradei has been regarded as an outsider in Egypt because of his international achievements. While he ran unsuccessfully for president last year, he persisted as a reformer and has a reputation as a technocrat. Fahmy is the founding dean of American University in Cairo's School of Public Affairs and a \"career diplomat,\" according to his bio on the school website. He has \"played an active role in the numerous efforts to bring peace to the Middle East, as well as in international and regional disarmament affairs.\" Galal is managing director of the Economic Research Forum -- a research institution covering the Arab countries, Iran and Turkey -- and fits the bill as a technocrat. His bio on the ERF website calls him \"a noted, non-partisan, proponent of the importance of growth with equity\" and of the \"vital role of politics for sound economic policies. Zaazou was one of the few ministers in Morsy's Cabinet who hadn't been connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. He resigned from the Morsy government in the weeks before the coup, because a man associated with an Islamist group tied to militants who killed tourists in 1997 was appointed as governor of Luxor province. International tourism is a huge business in Egypt, and Luxor, with its ancient monuments, has been a major tourist attraction. The ongoing political unrest in Egypt has hurt tourism. Interim Prime Minister Hazem El-Beblawi will meet with Cabinet nominees Sunday and Monday in an effort to complete formation of a new government by Tuesday or Wednesday, state-run EGYNews reported. Egypt's fever of violence: Where is accountability? U.S. diplomacy . The United States has long had a close relationship with Egypt and a high-ranking diplomat is visiting there to \"underscore U.S. support for the Egyptian people,\" the State Department said. Egypt gets $1.3 billion in annual military aid. During the rule of Hosni Mubarak -- ousted in 2011 at the beginning of the Arab Spring -- the government had been pro-Western and a bulwark against Muslim extremism. It continues to maintain a peace treaty and diplomatic ties with Israel. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns is visiting Cairo through Tuesday. He will meet with \"interim government officials and civil society and business leaders.\" Civil society is a reference to nongovernmental groups and entities independent of government and business. Burns will be emphasizing \"an end to all violence, and a transition leading to an inclusive, democratically elected civilian government.\" All of the latest developments come as Egyptian authorities launch an investigation of ousted Morsy as well as several leaders and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. The state prosecutor opened the probe after receiving complaints against Morsy and FJP leaders, said Deputy Prosecutor General Adel al-Said. Prosecutors also froze the assets of 14 people, including prominent Muslim Brotherhood figures, as they investigate violence in Cairo.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you briefly describe the text?\n### Input: Get the measles vaccine, and you won\u2019t get the measles\u2014or give it to anyone else. Right? Well, not always. A person fully vaccinated against measles has contracted the disease and passed it on to others. The startling case study contradicts received wisdom about the vaccine and suggests that a recent swell of measles outbreaks in developed nations could mean more illnesses even among the vaccinated. \n  \n When it comes to the measles vaccine, two shots are better than one. Most people in the United States are initially vaccinated against the virus shortly after their first birthday and return for a booster shot as a toddler. Less than 1% of people who get both shots will contract the potentially lethal skin and respiratory infection. And even if a fully vaccinated person does become infected\u2014a rare situation known as \u201cvaccine failure\u201d\u2014they weren\u2019t thought to be contagious. \n  \n That\u2019s why a fully vaccinated 22-year-old theater employee in New York City who developed the measles in 2011 was released without hospitalization or quarantine. But like Typhoid Mary, this patient turned out to be unwittingly contagious. Ultimately, she transmitted the measles to four other people, according to a recent report in Clinical Infectious Diseases that tracked symptoms in the 88 people with whom \u201cMeasles Mary\u201d interacted while she was sick. Surprisingly, two of the secondary patients had been fully vaccinated. And although the other two had no record of receiving the vaccine, they both showed signs of previous measles exposure that should have conferred immunity. \n  \n A closer look at the blood samples taken during her treatment revealed how the immune defenses of Measles Mary broke down. As a first line of defense against the measles and other microbes, humans rely on a natural buttress of IgM antibodies. Like a wooden shield, they offer some protection from microbial assaults but aren\u2019t impenetrable. The vaccine (or a case of the measles) prompts the body to supplement this primary buffer with a stronger armor of IgG antibodies, some of which are able to neutralize the measles virus so it can\u2019t invade cells or spread to other patients. This secondary immune response was presumed to last for decades. \n  \n By analyzing her blood, the researchers found that Measles Mary mounted an IgM defense, as if she had never been vaccinated. Her blood also contained a potent arsenal of IgG antibodies, but a closer look revealed that none of these IgG antibodies were actually capable of neutralizing the measles virus. It seemed that her vaccine-given immunity had waned. \n  \n Although public health officials have assumed that measles immunity lasts forever, the case of Measles Mary highlights the reality that \u201cthe actual duration [of immunity] following infection or vaccination is unclear,\u201d says Jennifer Rosen, who led the investigation as director of epidemiology and surveillance at the New York City Bureau of Immunization. The possibility of waning immunity is particularly worrisome as the virus surfaces in major U.S. hubs like Boston, Seattle, New York, and the Los Angeles area. Rosen doesn\u2019t believe this single case merits a change in vaccination strategy\u2014for example, giving adults booster shots\u2014but she says that more regular surveillance to assess the strength of people\u2019s measles immunity is warranted. \n  \n If it turns out that vaccinated people lose their immunity as they get older, that could leave them vulnerable to measles outbreaks seeded by unvaccinated people\u2014which are increasingly common in the United States and other developed countries. Even a vaccine failure rate of 3% to 5% could devastate a high school with a few thousand students, says Robert Jacobson, director of clinical studies for the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Vaccine Research Group in Rochester, Minnesota, who wasn\u2019t involved with the study. Still, he says, \u201cThe most important \u2018vaccine failure\u2019 with measles happens when people refuse the vaccine in the first place.\u201d ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Then four people she'd interacted with got sick\u2014including, oddly enough, two who had been vaccinated and two who showed signs of earlier measles exposure, which should have protected them. In Measles Mary's case, her vaccine-given immunity had apparently declined.

Statements like that feel gross, of course, if you know that Berdymukhamedov has been accused of imprisoning political dissidents, imposing \"draconian restrictions on freedom of expression and association,\" says Human Rights Watch, and, according to The Atlantic, ordering his goons to kill or get rid of stray cats. \"Singing happy birthday to dictators while dissidents and journalists die in their torture chambers?\" human rights lawyer Ronan Farrow (son of actress Mia Farrow) wrote on Twitter. \"Still Jenny from the block, @JLo?\" He followed-up that tweet with this orthographic quip about the pop star's visit to the former Soviet Bloc country, squished between Iran, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. \"More like Jenny from the bloc, am I right?\" The criticism is fully warranted. But there could be a positive here: When J-Lo and other celebrities stumble unknowingly (yes, apparently unknowingly: A publicist told CNN that \"had there been knowledge of human right issues of any kind, Jennifer would not have attended.\" This, in the age of Google!) into human rights quagmires, a kind of awareness gets raised. J-Lo's concert in Turkmenistan may at least give the rest of us a chance to learn something about a desperate nation that never would make American headlines if not for such a celebrity appearance. Raise your hand if you could name (much less spell the name of) Turkmenistan's president before this weekend? Considering how well-controlled the country's Internet is, I'll assume you're not from there and knew almost nothing about the place. Now that we (J-Lo, that is) have your attention, consider these sobering facts: . \u2022 Freedom House ranks Turkmenistan as one of its \"Worst of the Worst\" countries. The group says Turkmenistan is \"not an electoral democracy\" since \"none of the country's elections ... have been free or fair.\" Additionally: \"Employment and educational opportunities for ethnic minorities are limited by the government's promotion of Turkmen national identity. Freedom of movement is restricted, with a reported blacklist preventing some individuals from leaving the country. Traditional social and religious norms, inadequate education, and poor economic conditions limit professional opportunities for women, and anecdotal reports suggest that domestic violence is common.\" \u2022 Human Rights Watch condemns Turkmenistan for imprisoning and silencing political opposition figures. \"As a result of more than two decades of the government's practice of using imprisonment as a tool for political retaliation,\" the group says, \"unknown numbers of individuals languish in Turkmen prisons on what appear to be politically motivated charges. During the previous (Universal Periodic Review), the government rejected an important recommendation to 'account for those prisoners whose fate is unknown.' The fate of some of several dozen prisoners convicted in relation to the November 2002 alleged assassination attempt on then-president Saparmurat Niyazov remains unknown, with their whereabouts not disclosed even to their families.\" \u2022 Turkmenistan is basically North Korea plus oil, as Robert Kelly writes on the Asian Security Blog. (Hat tip to Max Fisher for spotting that. Specifically, Kelly says North Korea has been referred to as \"Turkmenistan without the oil.\") \u2022 Berdymukhamedov (here's a pronunciation guide from Voice of America) hates pets as well as humans. Eurasianet quotes from a diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks: \"There have been reports about a recent incident in which a motorist crossed an intersection in front President Berdimuhamedov's motorcade as it moved through Ashgabat. Several high ranking police officials were fired after the incident, and the driver of the vehicle was reportedly beaten and charged with attempted assassination. In another incident, a military official was fired after a cat ran in front of the president's car as he was traveling to his dacha,\" or second home. Calls and e-mails to Turkmenistan's embassy in Washington were not returned on Tuesday morning. It would be easy to argue Lopez's performance served only to legitimize Turkmenistan's government. Or that her appearance could serve to paint the country (inaccurately) as a modern and welcoming place -- the kind of open, dance-ready society that loves freedom and rocks to \"Get Right.\" Exactly the opposite is happening in the wake of her performance, however. People are learning a thing or two about how desperate Turkmenistan is. And a diva's visit with a despot can raise more than awareness. After being publicly shamed for performing on behalf of the government of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, Beyonc\u00e9, Usher, Mariah Carey and Nelly Furtado announced in 2011 that they had donated or planned to donate the money they received to charity. J-Lo should do the same, as New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof has suggested. In effect, that would mean Turkmenistan's dictator unwillingly is funding human rights efforts. And it would be a sign J-Lo, too, learned something from this experience. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of John D. Sutter.\n### Response: ", "target": "Singer Jennifer Lopez draws criticism for her performance in Turkmenistan .\nJohn Sutter says the \"Happy Birthday\" concert actually was productive .\nHe says Lopez inadvertently lent her celebrity to raising awareness about human rights .\nSutter: \"a diva's visit with a despot can raise more than awareness\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction: How would you encapsulate this?\n### Input:London (CNN) -- For months, the West has struggled to take a strong stand against Russia for its incursion into Ukraine. And while Europe's leaders are acutely aware of the threat to peace on their Eastern flank, the countries with the most at stake have, time after time, seemed unable to present a united and resolute front. But the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 has become a game changer -- a watershed moment which most concede would be too dangerous to let go. And now, as Europe prepares to finally take decisive steps, its chiefs will have to recognize that, if they are to be effective, they will also have to hurt their economies. As a block, the European Union exports about 100 billion euros worth of goods and services to Russia and takes in roughly 200 billion euros of the latter's imports. That is money that matters, for sure, but it's not Russia's role as a consumer that would affect Europe most. Rather, it's Russia's function as a major supplier of energy. Should Russia cut its gas to the West in response, the loss in European production would more damaging than the hit its trade balance would take. Just as the region is trying its best to revive a stagnant economy, attempting to mend a fragile debt market and tackle high unemployment, alienating a major trading partner next door is a risk Europe's ministers are understandably loath to take. And some countries have more to lose than others. With its billion dollar contracts for Mistral warships -- a deal which keeps some 1,000 Frenchmen and women employed in a country with a 10% unemployment rate -- France is Europe's largest supplier of arms to Russia. The UK also provides more minor military hardware and sells cars to Russia. With its own gas fields in the North Sea and the potential in future years to harness its shale oil, the UK does have other energy options. However if the EU hits Russian state-owned banks, London's financial center would suffer while its luxurious residences in the capital would also become less appealing to the swathe of oligarchs who have relocated to Britain of late. For Germany, curtailed trade with Russia could really bite. And considering as the former is Europe's biggest economy the implications would be felt well beyond its borders. More than 6,000 German firms operate in Russia, pouring in billions of dollars in foreign direct investment. Some 300,000 German workers depend on their country's trade with Russia for their livelihoods. Sectors like the automotive industry, defense and engineering which have haemorrhaged jobs since the 2008 crisis would be hit hard once again. So, are such sanctions really worth it and would they work? To answer this question it depends on what Europe hopes to achieve. Russia's economy was already headed for a recession before Europe and the U.S. started talking tough. Some $90 billion of capital is likely to flee its markets this year, according to the conservative estimates of Russia's central bank which was forced to pull a recent bond auction due to unfavorable market conditions. By tightening the noose over Russia's banks, Europe hopes not only to turn the country's key industrialists away from president Putin but also to limit the Kremlin's ability to fund its banks on the international markets, meaning Russia would have to dig deep into its currency reserves and undermine the value of the Ruble -- a currency which has up until now been surprisingly unruffled. In the longer term -- say in three to five years-- bans on equipment and so-called sensitive technologies to the energy sector could hamper Russian plans to further exploit its massive oil and gas reserves. Presumably the EU hopes that for everyone's sake the crisis surrounding Ukraine will be solved by then. But in the meantime, if the EU intends to send the strong message it needs, its leaders must reconcile their wish to make a point with the potential to lose a few points off of their GDP.

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?(CNN) -- Durable, shock resistant and, most of all, growing in a ready-to-use tubular form, it's a wonder bamboo hasn't always been used to make bicycle frames. While the prototype for a bamboo-framed bicycle was first developed as early as 1894 -- causing a minor sensation when it was unveiled at a London technology show at the time -- the idea never took off. Now 120 years later and a small but determined outfit in Ghana is working hard to change all that. \"We can't keep (up) demand with the orders for our customized bicycles,\" explains Bernice Dapaah, the executive director of Ghana Bamboo Bikes Initiative. \"We are hoping to go into mass production by June this year.\" While mass production for a company that currently employs about 30 people means turning out just 60 to 100 of the beautiful handmade bicycles a month, Dapaah is confident of scaling up the operation. Here the advent of a minimal amount of technology has made all the difference. \"We still do it by hand, but now we've got a construction jig and this makes manufacture that much faster,\" she told CNN from the small factory outside the capital Accra. Using a method developed by American engineer Craig Calfee -- a renowned bicycle designer who first experimented with bamboo bicycles in 1995 -- the frames are lashed together with fiber and then coated with epoxy. Sturdy, and with a greater weight-to-strength ratio than steel, the bikes are robust, make for a smooth ride and are gaining a small but devoted following in Europe. Growing international attention . \"We are getting a lot of interest from the United Kingdom where people are using them for touring,\" she said. \"And they're popular with shops and exhibitors because people like the look of them.\" Their first prototype came out of the factory more than four years ago and is still in operation. Dapaah said the bikes are remarkably durable and there's every indication that the first model will continue for many years to come. With just two sticks of bamboo enough to make one bicycle, and six regions in Ghana where bamboo grows abundantly, the Ghana Bike Initiative is unlikely to run out of raw materials. Last November the bicycle was the darling of the Warsaw Climate Change Conference (Conference of the Parties 19) where UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon donned a crash helmet to take a shaky turn around the conference center on one of the Ghanaian bikes. Christiana Figueres, the head of the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), also entrusted herself to the bicycle's rigid pannier rack to hitch a ride around the center. \"They're made by women and these women are teaching other women to make these bamboo bikes and to sell them so that they have another income stream,\" Figueres said. Building opportunities . As a vehicle for women's emancipation, the bicycle in history has been unrivalled. During the bicycle craze in the United States and Europe of the late 19th century, it came to symbolize the new woman, not only giving them unprecedented mobility but launching reform movements such as the Rational Dress Society which advocated for a woman's right to dress appropriately for cycling. For Dapaah -- who co-founded the company with school friends Kwame Kyei and Winnifred Selby -- the Ghana Bamboo Bikes Initiative proudly carries on that tradition. \"Currently we have about 20 to 25 women trained who are working in the factory but as we expand we hope to bring more on board,\" she said, adding that the initiative was launched as a way of using local renewable materials and satisfied local needs and created employment opportunities. \"Not only that but it looks cool and attractive,\" she said. One customized model even comes emblazoned with Martin Luther King motifs rendered in distinctive Ghanaian folk-art style. She said the prize the initiative won last year in Warsaw, the UNFCCC Momentum for Change Women for Results Award, was bringing with it more attention, more orders and greater ambitions for the company. \"Currently we don't manufacture many of the metal parts -- the chain and the forks we have to import but some of the metal parts for the frame are manufactured here. \"But we are hoping that if we find a collaborator in the medium to long-term, the tires, the wheels, the chain, and everything else could be made here in our factory.\" CNN's On the Road series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile.

{"source": "### Instruction :What's the text mainly about?\n### Input:For years, China has talked about promoting \"green growth.\" But this probably isn't what they had in mind. For the seventh year in a row, monstrous quantities of green algae known as enteromorpha prolifera have sprouted in the coastal waters near Qingdao, China. But this year's growth, covering 28,900 square kilometers (11,158 square miles), is the biggest outbreak ever recorded, state-run news agency Xinhua reported. The previous record was 13,000 square kilometers (5019 square miles) in 2008. Swimmers and beachgoers were pictured frolicking among the stringy piles of slime, while bulldozers attempted to scoop it away. Chinese officials have blamed past algae outbreaks on unusually warm seas. Dr. Christopher Bolch, an algae expert at the University of Tasmania, says the explanation doesn't hold water. \"You may get faster growth rates with higher temperatures, but you can't get such large amounts of biomass without access to nutrients,\" he explained. According to Bolch, massive algae blooms feed off of high levels of nitrites and phosphates in the water, which typically comes from agricultural waste, industrial pollution, or human sewage from highly populated areas. Enteromorpha is \"fairly benign,\" said Bolch, but can harm marine ecosystems. Algae blocks sunlight from reaching aquatic life, reduces oxygen levels, and emits bacteria when the algae dies and rots. Similar but more dangerous types of aquatic growths, such as phytobacteria or dinoflagellates, can produce harmful toxins and posion people.  \"They should consider themselves quite lucky that it's not one of those,\" said Bolch. Chinese state media reported that the seaweed began proliferating on June 5, and that local governments had \"taken measures\" to minimize the impact to marine ecosystems. Officials reported that they had removed around 7,335 tons of algae. Bolch said enteromorpha typically does not cause health problems in humans, but \"large concentrations of anything can be problematic.\" There could be a risk of skin inflammation, said Bolch. \"If you were stupid enough to go in, I wouldn't go in naked.\" In 2012: Melting Arctic 'blooms' with algae .\n### Response: ", "target": "Coastal waters near Qingdao covered with 28,900 sq km of green algae .\nLargest outbreak seen by local officials, doubling previous record in 2008 .\nScientist says algae is caused by pollution and sewage in water .\nAlgae 'generally not harmful' to humans, but scientist urges caution .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Doing so aboard a 15-meter yacht, hemmed in by the thick ocean ice of one of the harshest environments on earth must surely complicate matters a whole lot more. But Eric Brossier wouldn't have it any other way. The French oceanographer and his wife, France, have spent the past eight winters happily recording scientific data across the northern polar-regions while living aboard a specially equipped yacht fittingly called Le Vagabond. Since 2007, the couple have been accompanied by their eldest daughter, Leonie (now six) and, since 2009, her younger sister Aurora (now three). \"It's not an ordinary life,\" he explained from the lower deck of the vessel-come-family home. \"Outside is minus 27 degrees and we won't see the sun for at least a few more weeks. \"[But we] love the wildlife, the mountains, sailing in between the ice, the mix of pack ice drifting with icebergs next to glaciers,\" he added. See also: Fine sailing art graces London in the snow . Brossier has carried out a raft of seasonal studies near the remote island of Spitsbergen, Norway, and around coastal Greenland in recent years. Polar bears, walruses and an array of spectacular arctic creatures have proved more regular company than people during these trips, which can last between six months and a year at a time. This year, however, the family headed further west and dropped anchor outside the remote Inuit town of Grise Fiord in the Canadian Arctic. The trip marks the first time they have set up camp close to a human settlement. \"The main reasons we decided to come here this winter was so that our eldest daughter could go to school and our youngest daughter could socialize with other kids her own age,\" Brossier said. \"Without kids we'd probably live a couple of kilometers further out just to feel nature a little bit more. \"Still, the town only has a population of around 120 people and we can head out if we wish on snow mobile or with dogs,\" he added. See also: Superyacht doubles as a science lab . Although Grise Fiord represents the most northerly civilian settlement in North America, Brossier explains that the town is still privy to the comforts of contemporary western life. Homes have central heating, running water and access to the internet, with Facebook being one of the most popular modes of communication -- a far cry from the spartan existence of Inuit communities in Greenland and northern Russia. Yet these modern trappings provide the Brossiers with a happy medium between the Arctic wilderness the family so adores, suitable schooling facilities and viable long-term research work. Brossier says his current assignment is based around the earth's changing climate. He is paid to measure the thickness of the winter ice, ocean currents and weather patterns in and around Grise Fiord for research institutions in Toronto and Vancouver. In previous years however, he has acted as a guide for television and documentary crews. \"We decide where to go according to the job offered to us or the measurements we have to take,\" he said. \"If we can find such projects in the future that meet our work needs and the needs of our children then we may be able to carry on for five or ten years,\" he added. But while enthusiastic about adventures the future may hold, Brossier is aware that others -- especially those with young children -- may find his nomadic lifestyle in the Arctic chill less than appealing. He admits there are things he misses from time to time but would advise any avid scientist, sailor or adventurer keen to experience the far north to set sail and experience it for themselves.

Pakistan has deployed paramilitary troops to a district taken over by the Taliban. A Pakistani government official said the militants fully withdrew from the Buner district on Friday, although other officials cast doubt on the extent of the pullout and how long it would last. Buner is only 60 miles outside Islamabad. The situation is particularly concerning because Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state. The Islamic republic is believed to have between 30 and 40 nuclear warheads, according to the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Those warheads, however, are unassembled and scattered about Pakistan in areas that are not under the control of the Taliban, several analysts said. iReport: Should the U.S. intercede in Pakistan? Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that Pakistan was in danger of falling into terrorist hands. But Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, said that the situation is not as dire as Clinton described. \"Yes, we have a challenge,\" Haqqani told CNN. \"But, no, we do not have a situation in which the government or the country of Pakistan is about to fall to the Taliban.\" Analyst Michael Krepon said while the news out of Pakistan is \"disturbing,\" the real concern is what happens if Pakistan decides to move the weapons components, which are closely guarded by its army. \"The nuclear weapons are the most well-guarded inanimate objects in the country,\" said Krepon, co-founder of the Stimson Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. \"When they're not in motion, they're not going to be subject to hijacking or being overrun by the Taliban.\" Krepon, who studies Pakistan's and India's nuclear programs, said tensions between those two countries could prompt Pakistan to move its weapons components. \"If there's a crisis with India ... odds increase greatly that weapons could move around, and when weapons move around, it is very worrisome,\" he said.  Watch a former CIA official view \u00bb . However, Pakistani political consultant Hasan-Askari Rizvi downplayed the threat of the Taliban insurgency to Pakistan's nuclear weapons program. \"The threat to nuclear weapons is not so imminent because they are far away from those places and secondly, they are under control of the army,\" Rizvi said. \"Only a few people in the army know about it,\" he said, noting that the Pakistani army would defend their control of the nuclear weapons until the end. \"It's a source of power,\" Rizvi said. \"Whoever controls the weapons will dictate to the Pakistani government.\" Commentators and politicians in the West have long harbored concerns that Pakistan's nuclear weapons could be stolen by Islamic militants. A month after suspected Islamist extremists assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December 2007, top Pakistani security officials held a special briefing with Western journalists, insisting that the country's nuclear arsenal is secure from Islamic extremists. The January 26, 2008 news conference took place a few weeks after IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei warned that Pakistan's \"many internal problems\" put the country's nuclear arms at much greater risk. At the briefing, Lt. Gen. Khalid Kidwai -- head of the army division that controls Pakistan's nuclear sites and weapons -- said the country's weapons were protected by a \"fool-proof\" security system. Kidwai said there are 10,000 troops assigned to guard the country's nuclear facilities, including special agents who report directly to the country's intelligence services. He stressed that Pakistani military sites were equipped with security cameras; biometrics and access control; bullet-proof vehicles, high security walls; and quick reaction forces. Around 2,000 scientists working with sensitive materials and information at the sites had to undergo extensive background checks before being given security clearances, he added. \"In Pakistan we have been extremely conscious of our responsibilities and obligations in this regard and we have instituted command and control structures and security measures in a manner so as to make these fool proof,\" Kidwai said.

Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington. Airline passengers may get some relief from restrictions on use of personal electronic devices... (Associated Press) \n  \n The 28-member FAA advisory committee voted to recommend the change during a closed-door meeting Thursday, said industry officials familiar with the deliberations. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the government asked them not to talk publicly about their deliberations. \n  \n The recommendation will be sent Monday to the Federal Aviation Administration, which has final say on whether to ease current restrictions on the use of personal electronic devices on planes. \n  \n If the panel's advice is followed, passengers would have greater opportunity to use most devices below an altitude of 10,000 feet, although some devices would have to be switched to airplane mode. Downloading data, surfing the Web and talking on the phone would remain prohibited. \n  \n \"You will not be able to play `Words With Friends,' you will not be able to shop, you will not be able to surf websites or send email,\" said Henry Harteveldt, an airline and travel industry analyst with Hudson Crossing who was reacting to word of the recommended change. \n  \n \"You will be able to read or work on what's stored on the device,\" he said. \"You want to edit that PowerPoint? Great. You want to watch `Breaking Bad' and you have it downloaded to your smartphone or your tablet? You can continue to do that.\" \n  \n Passengers are currently required to turn off phones and other electronic devices while planes are below 10,000 feet to prevent interference with sensitive cockpit equipment. Takeoffs and landings are the most critical phases of flight. But newer aircraft are better equipped to prevent electronic interference, and critics long have complained that the safety concerns behind the regulations are groundless. \n  \n \"We've been fighting for our customers on this issue for years _ testing an airplane packed full of Kindles, working with the FAA and serving as the device manufacturer on this committee,\" Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement. \"This is a big win for customers, and frankly, it's about time.\" \n  \n \"These devices are not dangerous. Your Kindle isn't dangerous. Your iPad that is on airplane mode is perfectly safe,\" Sen.

There have been many reports from pilots over the years of electronic interference that appeared to have been caused by passenger use of devices. Technical panels that have looked into the issue in the past concluded evidence that the devices were safe wasn't sufficient to merit lifting restrictions. \n  \n But Delta Airlines said in a letter to the FAA last year that out of 2.3 million flights over two years, the airline received 27 reports from pilots and maintenance crews of possible device interference. None of the reports could be confirmed, the letter said. \n  \n It's up to FAA officials whether to follow the committee's recommendations. The agency created the committee, put several of its employees on the panel and was closely involved in the deliberations, so it's expected that all or most of the recommendations will be implemented. How long that will take is unclear. \n  \n Airline passengers could see restrictions lifted as soon as early 2014 if the agency chooses a faster implementation track, or the process could drag on for a year or more if airlines have to apply, carrier by carrier, to have their planes approved as safe for use of the devices, industry officials said. \n  \n McCaskill said that if FAA officials don't \"act swiftly\" to implement the recommendations, she'll introduce legislation to force their hand. \n  \n The FAA doesn't have the authority to lift restrictions on cellphone calls. The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the cellphone industry, has opposed allowing passengers on fast-moving planes to make phone calls, citing potential interference with cellular networks as phones in the sky skip from cell tower to cell tower faster than networks can keep up. \n  \n ___ \n  \n Follow Joan Lowy on Twitter at https://twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy ||||| Article Excerpt \n  \n An FAA advisory committee has concluded passengers can safely use hand-held electronic devices, including those connected to onboard Wi-Fi systems, during all portions of flights on nearly all U.S. airliners, according to one of the group's leaders. \n  \n The committee's report and its more than two dozen recommendations, which haven't yet been released by the Federal Aviation Administration, go further than industry officials previously suggested in recommending lifting current restrictions on such devices under 10,000 feet. \n  \n The panel determined that no matter what applications the devices are running or what wireless-transmission mode they are in, \"the vast majority\" of aircraft \"are ... |||||\n### Response :", "target": "\u2013 The end is in sight for that game in which the flight attendant tells you to turn off your e-reader for takeoff like she really thinks it's going to crash the plane, and you nod solemnly and pretend to actually turn it off until she's out of sight.

Bryant Purvis says he is focusing on his studies and practicing basketball. Purvis, who was facing charges of second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy, entered a not guilty plea to the reduced charges in the LaSalle Parish Courthouse in Jena. Charges have now been reduced against at least five of the students in the racially charged \"Jena 6\" case. Charges against Jesse Ray Beard, who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime, are unavailable because he's a juvenile. Civil rights leaders Martin Luther King III and Al Sharpton led more than 15,000 marchers to Jena -- a town of about 3,000 -- in September to protest how authorities handled the cases against Purvis and five other teens accused of the December 2006 beating of fellow student Justin Barker. After the arraignment, Purvis said he has moved to another town to complete high school. He said he is focusing on his studies and practicing basketball, which he hopes to play in college. Mychal Bell, 17, is the only one of the \"Jena 6\" teens still in jail. Although he was released in September after his adult criminal conviction for the beating was overturned, he was ordered two weeks later to spend 18 months in a juvenile facility for a probation violation relating to an earlier juvenile conviction. A district judge tossed out Bell's conviction for conspiracy to commit second-degree battery, saying the matter should have been handled in juvenile court. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal in Lake Charles, Louisiana, did the same with Bell's battery conviction in mid-September. Prosecutors originally charged all six black students accused of being involved in beating Barker with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy.

A win for United would have all but sealed a record 19th championship, but they now lead Chelsea by just three points and Arsenal by six. The top two play effectively a title decider at Old Trafford next weekend, with Arsenal waiting to pounce if either falters. \"In terms of ability -- a game at Old Trafford, the supporters will be ready for it -- and so will our players,\" defiant United manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports. Ferguson's team, who have a poor record against the top six this season, particularly away from home where they have failed to win, fell victim to a 56th minute strike from young Welshman Ramsey. Arsenal might have had a penalty in the first half when Nemanja Vidic appeared to use his hand to deflect Theo Walcott's cross away from Robin van Persie as the Dutchman prepared to head towards goal, but referee Chris Foy ignored their claims. United's Wayne Rooney went close with a curling free-kick that Wojciech Szczesny saved superbly after the break before Ramsey scored his first Gunners goal since January 2010. He was set up by Van Persie who cut the ball back for him to beat Edwin van der Sar. Nani went close for United and Michael Owen had a penalty appeal turned down, but Arsenal deservedly held on for their first victory over United since November 2008. Sunday's late kick off saw Manchester City consolidate fourth place with a 2-1 win over bottom side West Ham at Eastlands. City are now seven points clear of Liverpool and Tottenham as they try to claim the final Champions League qualifying position. Nigel de Jong and a Lars Jacobsen own goal gave City a 2-0 lead after 15 minutes. But Demba Ba pulled one back in the 33rd minute and the home side had to endure some nervous moments before sealing the three points. Earlier Sunday, Liverpool moved over Tottenham into fifth place on goal difference with a 3-0 win over Newcastle at Anfield. Maxi Rodriguez opened the scoring in the 10th minute when his shot deflected in off Danny Simpson. Dirk Kuyt scored the second in the 59th minute after Luis Suarez was fouled by Mike Williamson.

{"source": "### Instruction : How would you outline the content?\n### Input:(CNN) -- Nearly two centuries ago Wednesday, Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry signed an obscure redistricting law that helped his party stay in office and, more importantly, codified one of the most enduring legacies in U.S. politics: gerrymandering. The U.S. House of Represenatives, home to many beneficiaries of gerrymandering. Now a part of an American lexicon often heard in Washington's K Street bars and among \"inside-the-beltway\" crowds, the term is seen as a combination of the governor's name and the word \"salamander,\" because of the salamander-like shape one electoral district took on after the redistricting. Elected governor in 1810, Gerry signed the redistricting bill two years later, enabling greater and perhaps disproportionate Republican representation in the Massachusetts legislature. The controversial move has become a favorite across the country among incumbent parties, which pack opposition voters into districts already lost in an effort to minimize the opposition's influence over the state's broader electorate. But some political analysts cry foul. \"In the end, democracy comes out the big loser,\" former federal prosecutor Edward Lazarus wrote in a 2004 column for CNN. \"The effect of such partisan gerrymandering is to block new entrants into high political office and to make the result of almost every congressional election a foregone conclusion. This, in turn, effectively disenfranchises all those voters who don't support the preordained winner,\" he wrote. In 2006, the Supreme Court threw out part of a Texas congressional map, but found the overall redistricting plan orchestrated by House Republicans acceptable. The redistricting helped Republicans in Texas defeat four Democratic congressmen in the 2004 elections. The court ruled that the redistricting plan, promoted by then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, unfairly weakened the voting strength of Latinos in two congressional districts. \"A state may not trade off the rights of some members of a racial group against the rights of other members of that group,\" wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy. \"The question is therefore not whether line-drawing in the challenged area as a whole dilutes minority voting strength, but whether line-drawing dilutes the voting strength of the Latinos in [Texas'] District 23.\" The court ordered that District 23 be redrawn. States are constitutionally required to redraw congressional districts every 10 years in line with population shifts documented by the U.S. Census Bureau, a part of the Department of Commerce. This year, controversy re-emerged when President Barack Obama announced a decision to cross party lines and nominate U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg, R-New Hampshire, to run the Commerce Department. The move sparked criticism from leaders of minority groups concerned that the Census Bureau under Gregg, who voted to abolish the Commerce Department in 1995, might lack the resources needed to accurately count minorities. The White House promised to work directly with bureau's director to assuage those concerns, but that response drew further criticism from House Republicans concerned about greater executive influence in the Census Bureau. In a letter to the president, House Republicans Patrick McHenry and Darrell Issa described the White House as \"circumventing the secretary of commerce\" and called it \"both outrageous and unprecedented,\" suggesting the Obama administration could affect U.S. census results and congressional districting due out in 2010. The move, they say, could insulate Democratic congressional power. The White House said it recognizes the importance of an accurate census count \"free from politicization\" and added it \"has not proposed removing the census from the Department of Commerce.\" \"From the first days of the transition, the census has been a priority for the president, and a process he wanted to re-evaluate,\" it said in an earlier statement. The method through which the Census Bureau collects data has long been a topic of partisan bickering. Republicans have generally favored the \"door-to-door\" approach, which actually is done primarily by self-enumeration through the U.S. mail. Democrats commonly prefer a statistical sampling method meant to fill in \"population gaps\" they say occur because some members of minority groups and homeless populations are missed by the door-to-door approach. A 1999 Supreme Court ruling said statistical sampling could not be applied to the redistribution of congressional seats, but it did not put gerrymandering of the political landscape entirely off limits. So, almost 200 years after Elbridge Gerry helped coin the term, gerrymandering remains a key part of American politics.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you briefly describe the text?(CNN) -- With just 3,700 residents in Red Bud, Illinois, Denise Metzger is using the process of elimination to guess who bought a lottery ticket now worth $218 million at her convenience store last month. \"We're watching to figure out who hasn't been coming in,\" Metzger, manager of the Moto Mart, said Tuesday. \"If they got the ticket and are making themselves scarce, that's what we've been paying attention to.\" The Mega Millions mystery winner's identity will be revealed by Illinois lottery officials at the Red Bud Village Hall by Wednesday morning. Mayor Tim Lowry sees the decision by the winner to have the announcement in his southern Illinois town as evidence it's a Red Bud resident. \"Not knowing who it is, it seems like they want to make a splash in Red Bud,\" Lowry said. It probably didn't help that the drawing happened on the eve of April Fools' weekend, leading some locals to joke on Facebook and the sidewalk that they had the winning ticket. It kicked off more than two weeks of speculation around town and online. Michigan winner charged with welfare fraud . Red Bud locals commenting on a message board thread threw out several names of suspected winners. \"Names are just going around, we just need to wait and see when they come forward. Congrats to whoever it was!\" one poster wrote. \"I really don't care who won. I really don't want to know, It wasn't me so I could care less!!!\" said another. \"I just hope it is someone that needs the money,\" another commenter said. Moto Mart, which has seen a two-fold rise in lottery ticket sales, also seems to be gossip central for lottery rumors. One rumor floating there is that someone ordered 12 new Camaros from the local Chevrolet dealership, Metzger said. \"That's a big rumor. I had a big laugh about that one.\" The sales manager at Weir Chevrolet Buick GMC shot down that gossip. \"They were Corvettes,\" said Brandon Liefer. \"I'm just messing with you,\" Liefer added, clarifying that he has no clue who the new millionaire might be and they've not ordered new cars. The mayor said the \"windfall of money\" could be a boostfor his farming community's economy, but a person \"can only buy so many groceries.\" The winner may find it tough to stay in a small town like Red Bud and avoid having their privacy invaded, he said. Two other winning tickets were sold for the March 30 drawing that had a record $656 million pre-tax payout. Maryland and Kansas allowed their winners to remain unnamed, but Illinois requires them to come forward publicly. The man and two women who shared ownership of the winning ticket in Maryland are public school employees who are known only as the \"Three Amigos.\" The elementary school teacher, a special education teacher, and an administrative worker said they plan to keep their fortune a secret -- and keep working. Metzger and her nine employees at Moto Mart collected their own payoff for selling the winning ticket.

Wen hosted a welcome ceremony for Putin at the Great Hall of the People at the start of a three-day visit, before their private talks and a larger session involving ministers from both sides, Xinhua said. \"Russia and China have become genuine and comprehensive strategic and cooperative partners in recent years,\" Putin was quoted by Xinhua as saying. Bilateral relations have become stable and mature since the forging of diplomatic ties 60 years ago and particularly the establishment of the Russia-China strategic cooperative partnership in 1996, Wen told reporters.

{"source": "### Instruction :What's the main idea?\n### Input:(CNN) -- It is widely recognized that the signing of the Armistice in 1918 did not put an end to the drama that began in 1914. Traditional geopolitical rivalries continued but now overlapped with competing ideologies of fascism and Stalinism to foster a climate of permanent war. That is why many observers at the time described the period 1914-1945 as a modern version of the Thirty Years War. Yet this second Thirty Years War soon gave way to the four decades-long Cold War. For a very brief moment the demise of the Cold War appeared to bring to an end the conflicts unleashed on the battlefields in 1914. But this \"End of History\" moment was brief. Today we are in the midst of a conflict originally designated as a \"War on Terror\" but which has been rebranded by the American government as the \"Long War\" and more recently as \"Overseas Contingency Operation.\" The conflicts unleashed in 1914 were not confined to the military sphere. They were also a battle of ideas and a clash of cultures. The story that began in 1914 was influenced by a crisis of meaning that afflicted the political and cultural elites of western societies. A powerful mood of estrangement and disorientation dominated cultural life. In this moment of confusion even artists and intellectual sought meaning through fighting for a cause -- even a military one. Some of the most enthusiastic supporters of the war were motivated by a disposition to react against what they took to be the soulless world of capitalist modernity. Stefan Zweig, the renowned Austrian novelist, playwright and well-known pacifist lived to see two world wars. When the Great War broke out in 1914, he along with almost all European intellectuals, supported his nation's war effort. Later, with a hint of embarrassment he recalled the sense of excitement and celebration that the news of the impending conflict provoked among people. \"And to be truthful, I must acknowledge that there was a majestic, rapturous, and even seductive something in this first outbreak of the people from which one could escape only with difficulty,\" he recalled. World War I would be the last time that a significant body of intellectuals and artists would seek existential meaning on the battlefield. But conflicts over norms and values, which were crystallized through their quest for meaning continues to this day. Indeed on hindsight it is evident that the Great War was a catalyst for eroding the prevailing system of meaning and helped intensify a clash of values. That is why the origins of what is currently described as the Culture Wars can be situated at some time around August 1914. Culture became politicized and geopolitical ambitions were framed through appeals to a \"way of life.\" Today, very few respectable intellectuals would be caught waving the flag. Instead of the flag, competing groups flaunt their identity and instead of celebrating their way of life they acclaim their lifestyle. With the demise of old ideologies the politicization of culture has acquired an increasingly unrestrained character. It is worth noting that most of the high-profile divisive issues -- family life, gay marriage, abortion, assisted suicide, multiculturalism -- express conflicts over cultural values. These symbolic struggles over the constitution of legitimate lifestyles continually exacerbate the fragmentation of social life. What's more disturbing is that such struggles increasingly extend into global affairs. The current conflict between Russia and its Western opponents is almost entirely conducted through the medium of culture. The denunciation of Putin as an authoritarian homophobe is self-consciously countered by the claim that Russia stands firm as the bastion of traditional values. Like Putin, many Muslims also take their stand on hallow grounds of tradition. Young Western Muslims self-consciously reject the values of the communities where they grew up and embrace a call to arms for a war of cultures. Jihadist videos often communicate a simple message -- which is that the Jihad provides quest for meaning. As I write, the war drums are again beating. Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the head of ISIS, has declared the establishment of a new caliphate in the Middle East. His object is to abolish one legacy of World War I, the border between Syria and Iraq. There is still no end in sight to the Great War.\n### Response :", "target": "The period 1914-1945 was once described as a modern version of the Thirty Years War .\nThis second Thirty Years War gave way to four decades-long Cold War, says Frank Furedi .\nFuredi: Origins of \"Culture Wars\" can be situated at some time around August 1914 .\nYoung Muslims embrace a call to arms for a war of cultures, he adds .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Produce an article summary of the following news article:Doc to summarize:\n### Input:MODESTO, California (CNN)  -- Some of the people hit hardest by this bad economy are the youngest. Almost 2 million children nationwide have had or will have their lives disrupted by home foreclosures, according to one study. There are more empty desks in Suzell Tougas's fourth grade classroom after 10 students have stopped coming. These are the children whose families have had to move, sometimes more than once. The youngsters are pulled out of school, often leaving their friends behind without even saying goodbye. Nine-year-old Kenia, who is in the fourth grade at Fairview Elementary School in Modesto, California, said that is what happened to her. She is new to the school, having moved to the area just a few months ago. She said it is really hard and she misses her friends. Her classmate Bethany said her best friend since kindergarten just left without saying goodbye. Heather Sharp, the principal at Fairview, said her school has been the one most affected by the bad economy in the Modesto City School system. \"We have, over the last couple of months, 50 students coming new to the school and 50 students leaving,\" Sharp said. It was so bad that the school conducted a door-to-door search for missing students, she said. \"We had our community aide going out to houses. And they were boarded up, windows boarded, yard brown. She had to go to neighbors to find out where the kids were.\" In terms of raw numbers, California had the most foreclosures of any state from 2007 through January 2009. More than 57,000 homes entered foreclosure. Many of those were in Stanislaus County, where home prices have declined 65 percent since December 2005, according to the Modesto Bee. Fourth-grade teacher Suzell Tougas said she has lost 10 kids from her class so far this year and is braced to lose more. She usually has a room full of children with every desk occupied. Now, it \"looks empty ... it's like a \"ghost town\". She said constant moving is hard on kids. \"Just having to start over and start over is really hard on a child,\" Tougas said. \"It takes six weeks for a child to adjust ... at least.\" While children are in that period of adjustment, she said, they aren't learning and their studies suffer. \"The biggest issue is that when [children have to move] when there are other stressors going on, we know it puts these kids at greater risk for being behind in their academics,\" said Pat Popp, a past president of the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth. That is borne out in a recent study by a nonpartisan group in Washington called First Focus. It said that children who move twice in one year are only half as likely as others to be able to read proficiently, and may have a greater chance of being held back. It also found that  moving a lot reduces the student's chance of graduating from high school by half. Read the report here . The report, published in May, estimated that 1.95 million children will be affected by foreclosure over the next two years. The number of homeless students is increasing dramatically. A study by the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children reported that more than 450 school districts across the nation had an increase of at least 25 percent in the number of identified homeless students between the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 school years. Read the report here (pdf) A student who moves \"may hear the same information again that you learned in your previous classroom or miss information that has already been covered in your class but wasn't taught in your previous school,\" Popp said. The fallout from the rash of foreclosures likely will have a long-term impact on education, especially in California. Schools get much of their funding from property tax revenues. Real estate values are spiraling downward and so is the revenue. At Fairview Elementary, Principal Sharp worries about students like 9-year-old Eunice, who has moved twice in the last year.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?(CNN)  -- Canada reserved the best to last as its ice hockey heroes beat arch-rivals the United States 3-2 with an overtime goal from Sidney Crosby to claim the final gold of the Winter Olympics. Crosby, Canada's star player, broke American hearts with his goal seven minutes and 40 seconds into added time to give the hosts its 14th gold of a triumphant Vancouver Games. Canada looked headed for a comfortable victory as Jonathan Toews scored in the first period and teammate Corey Perry followed up to make it 2-0 early in the second. But Ryan Kesler pulled one back later in the second period to set up a frantic finale. Canada's much-vaunted Stanley Cup hero Crosby missed a breakaway chance to seal the gold for his side but with the clock counting down it seemed not to matter. That was until the United States threw caution to the wind and Zach Parise forced overtime with just 25 seconds remaining, his fourth goal of the Games for the previously unbeaten in five U.S. squad. The momentum now appeared to be with the United States, who had beaten Canada 5-3 in a preliminary round match. But they reckoned without Crosby, who had not been a significant factor in the final until he came good as he received a pass from Jarome Iginla and slid his winning shot under U.S. goaltender Ryan Miller. He was immediately mobbed by teammates who had finally lived up to the expectations of an ice hockey-mad nation. \"I just shot it,\" Crosby told gathered reporters.\"It doesn't even feel real. It feels like a dream.\" It's the first victory for a host country in Olympic ice hockey since the famous United States triumph at Lake Placid in 1980. But their 2010 counterparts were unable to match their golden feat and it clearly hurt. \"We only came here for one thing we wanted that gold medal, it's really a tough feeling right now. It stings you a lot, said Patrick Kane. The other gold decided on the 17th and final day of action in Vancouver went to Norway's Petter Northug who won the men's 50km cross country title.

Together they developed a workout program, and the young man made great strides. \"Even (his) doctors saw the physical and psychological improvements we were able to make,\" Norton said. It didn't take long for word to spread. Patients from a rehabilitation center sought out Norton's help, and he began training them for free. After a newspaper published an article about Norton's workouts with the disabled, his phone rang off the hook. \"So I opened a gym designed to fit their needs,\" he said. For the past 25 years, Norton has dedicated himself to providing free and low-cost strength and conditioning training for hundreds of people living with a variety of disabilities. \"They can't move, they can't be independent. They can't live their lives,\" said Norton, 55. \"I'm building them up, building them stronger, so they can go out and live life like they're supposed to.\" Bodybuilder with a big heart . Norton trains more than 120 people every week through his nonprofit, Warriors on Wheels. His clients' disabilities include spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and Down syndrome. \"I never worry about what they can't do,\" said Norton. \"I worry about what they can do, and make them as independent and capable as possible.\" Participants come to the gym twice a week for one-hour sessions. Norton's strength-training equipment is specially adapted to fit his clients' needs. Most of the people he trains are in wheelchairs and rely on their upper body strength to get around. \"The world is more accessible now for people with wheelchairs,\" Norton said, \"but you've got to be strong to be in a wheelchair.\" Tom Clement knows that first-hand. About 40 years ago, he fell off a roof and severed his spinal cord. He has been in a wheelchair ever since. \"When you lose (the use of) your legs, your arms become your legs. So upper body strength is key,\" said Clement, 65. Clement has worked out at Norton's gym several times a week for the past 15 years. He says it's helped him live independently. \"My activities in the gym have increased my ability to maintain the stamina of everyday work,\" said Clement, who runs a frame shop and art gallery with his brother. \"Thanks to Ned, I've been able to live a full life.\" For those who can afford to pay it, Norton charges $25 a month. Most of his clients are living on disability income and Social Security, and he says less than half can afford to pay the fee. He never turns away anyone who has a disability. Strength in numbers . Norton is the only trainer in the facility, which was donated to him by the city. Participants often form friendships and motivate one another. They also become resources for each other, providing advice and references. \"After an accident, people are devastated. Their family and friends have no clue what they are going through. They are out there on their own,\" Norton said. \"But when they come here, they get a network of people going through the same challenges.\" Kathleen Lane has been coming to the Warriors on Wheels gym for about 15 years to help with her multiple sclerosis. Lane, who is in a wheelchair, also benefits from the social aspect of the program. \"I come out of here feeling better than I do when I first come in,\" said Lane, 51. \"It changed my life. ... Ned's unbelievable.\" Norton says many of the people he has worked with have gone on to drive again, gain employment and pursue their interests without letting their disabilities get in the way. \"I'm not a genius.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?\n### Input :(CNN) -- One of the most sensational and infamous murder cases in modern U.S. history returned to a courtroom Monday as former Green Beret doctor Jeffrey MacDonald sought a new trial in the killing of his family. MacDonald was back in court in Wilmington, North Carolina, as his lawyers argued new evidence should be heard by a jury. \"We feel like evidence is coming in the way we want it to. So we are very pleased at this point,\" MacDonald lawyer Gordon Widenhouse told CNN affilliate News 14 Carolina. MacDonald is serving a life sentence in the 1970 slayings of his wife and two young daughters in their Fort Bragg home. The 68-year-old has long maintained that they were beaten and stabbed to death by a group of hippies who broke into their homes, chanting \"kill the pigs\" and \"acid's groovy.\" MacDonald and his lawyers contend that DNA tests show that hair samples found underneath the fingernail of one of the victims did not come from a member of the MacDonald family and presumably were from one of the killers. The defense will also try to prove that the prosecutor in the criminal trial threatened Helena Stoeckley, a witness who had earlier confessed to being in the MacDonald home the night of the murders. MacDonald told investigators that he was at home, sleeping on a couch, when he heard screaming. He awoke to find three men and one woman, whom he described as having blond hair and wearing a floppy hat. He was found with two stab wounds and a collapsed lung. While an Army inquiry into the murders recommended that MacDonald not be court-martialed, a civilian federal jury found him guilty in 1979. He has been behind bars since 1982. But in 2011, a federal appeals court ruled that MacDonald was entitled to an evidentiary hearing. During MacDonald's trial, Stoeckley said she was not present and had no involvement in the killings. The defense insists the prosecutor, James Blackburn, pressured Stoeckley to alter her testimony. Stoeckley, who had a long history of drug and alcohol abuse, died in 1983. Blackburn would not comment on the charge, citing Monday's hearing. \"I was the prosecutor in the case, and I did that job to the best of my ability,\" Blackburn told CNN. \"I did it in great reliance of the evidence the government had, and we presented an honorable case and it was straightforward and it was based on good and competent evidence. And I agree with the jury's verdict.\" The MacDonald saga has captivated the public's attention for decades. It also became the focus of the controversial and popular book \"Fatal Vision\" by Joe McGinniss. On television, millions watched a miniseries about the case and a memorable \"60 Minutes\" interview with MacDonald. This month, Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker Errol Morris spoke to CNN about \"A Wilderness of Error: The Trials of Jeffrey MacDonald,\" his new book on the subject. \"We've been sold a bill of goods about this case,\" Morris said. \"It's as phony as a three-dollar bill.\" \"There are many things about this case that rub me the wrong way, but principal among them was how the jury was asked to make decisions about his guilt or innocence with incomplete evidence; evidence that was withheld, corrupted and suppressed.\" Author seeks to prove MacDonald is innocent .\n### Response : ", "target": "NEW: \"We are very pleased at this point,\" MacDonald lawyer says after first day .\nJeffrey MacDonald was convicted of killing his wife and two daughters in the 1970s .\nMacDonald blames a group of hippies for the murders .\nCourt ruled last year that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing; attorneys cite new DNA tests .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction: Write a summary of the given paragraph.\n### Input:(CNN) -- Cheryl Morse was 19 years old when she hitchhiked more than 700 miles from Chicago, Illinois, to Bethel, New York. She was determined to make it to the Woodstock music festival. An estimated 400,000 people attended the Woodstock music festival in Bethel, New York, in August 1969. Although Morse, now 59, no longer recalls details such as how long it took to get there or what food, if any, she ate, she still vividly remembers the music. When Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young opened their set with \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,\" she said the energy in the crowd was intoxicating. And she can still picture folk musicians Arlo Guthrie and Joan Baez performing in the rain Friday night. \"It was like being totally shut off from the rest of the world for three days, with nonstop music by world-class musicians playing their hearts out ... for our party,\" she said. Forty years later, the Woodstock Music and Arts Fair remains a major cultural touchstone. Held in Bethel on August 15, 16 and 17, 1969, the music festival welcomed some of the biggest musicians of the era and legions of fans from across the United States. Despite the concert's size -- an estimated 400,000 people attended the festival -- it seems the idea of Woodstock is bigger than the actual event was. It is remembered as a peace- and love-filled celebration, an out-of-this-world experience fueled by rock 'n' roll music and copious drugs.  See Woodstock 40 years ago, and what the site looks like today \u00bb . Like many others, it wasn't until Morse left the festival grounds and re-entered the outside world that she began to realize Woodstock's impact. She stopped at a local market on her way out of town and saw news coverage of the festival on television. \"Until [then], I had not thought about the outside world at all,\" Morse said. \"That was when I slowly began to comprehend the impact the gathering was having on the country.\" Woodstock, Morse explained, \"came at a pivotal point in history,\" when the Vietnam War and subsequent anti-war movement were in full swing. The festival, a massive event that was largely peaceful and free of riots, was considered exceptional for the time. Years later, Morse realized that Woodstock \"would never be forgotten,\" she said. \"It took you 10 years to realize you were part of history,\" said Lenny Eisenberg, who made the journey to Bethel to see Jimi Hendrix perform. \"At the time, it was just another great show.\" Part of the concert's lasting power was fueled by the Oscar-winning documentary \"Woodstock,\" which also led to a blurred perception of the festival, Eisenberg said. \"I have some distorted ideas of what happened,\" he said. Still, Eisenberg recalls Hendrix's performance that famously closed the festival on Monday morning. The aspiring photographer saved one of the three rolls of film he brought with him to document the guitarist's set. The wait was worth it, he said. Eisenberg captured several shots of Hendrix, including one of the guitarist with his middle finger in the air, seconds after he flashed a peace sign to the audience. iReport.com: See Eisenberg's photos . \"It's really hard to pin down a best memory,\" said Thomas Burke, who was 19 years old when he went to Woodstock. \"The whole place was a memory.\" Burke still has his Woodstock tickets along with the check his mother wrote for them. His memories from the event are fond, but fuzzy. \"I remember some of the acts, but not the order or where I was when they played,\" he said. He recalls seeing Richie Havens and Jefferson Airplane, and can't forget Hendrix's legendary performance of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\" \"Woodstock marked a big turning point in my life,\" said Burke, who was drafted into the Army soon after returning home from the festival. \"It was a fitting end to the '60s.\" \"It was the experience of a lifetime. I've always been proud of the fact that I was there,\" said Ralph Chin. He remembers the rain and mud, nonstop music, free-flowing drugs and conversations with strangers. For Chin, nothing can recapture Woodstock. \"I went to a couple other festivals after Woodstock, but they fell short on the overall feeling,\" he said. iReport.com: 'The experience of a lifetime' \"Woodstock was like a big party with all your friends there, whereas the festivals afterward felt more like you were an independent entity and had no connections to anyone else.\" \"I think it was the ultimate spontaneous thing. It just happened,\" said John Laferlita, a photographer who attended Woodstock at 23. Laferlita heard about the festival on the radio and thought, \"Why not?\" He hopped on a bus from Manhattan, New York, on Saturday, with little more than his camera and tickets. Like many others, he slept on the ground that night. \"There hasn't been anything like it,\" added Laferlita. \"Everything else is planned to the minute, but this was spontaneous.

Combet said officials are unlikely to identify every soldier at Fromelles, though they will try. DNA was key to identifying the soldiers, but historical, anthropological, and artifact evidence was also used, he said. \"I am also pleased to say that we have strong reason to believe that more identification could occur in the future,\" he said. Excavations of the mass grave began in May 2009 and lasted until September. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which builds and maintains cemeteries for Commonwealth troops who died in the two world wars, built a cemetery near the site of the battle where the excavated troops are being reburied. The Pheasant Wood cemetery was the first full cemetery it had constructed in more than 50 years, the commission said. \"All but one of the soldiers have been reburied in individual graves in the purpose-built Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery,\" said Alan Griffin, Australia's minister for veterans affairs. Those whose identities cannot be determined will be marked by a headstone reading \"Known unto God,\" the commission said. The final soldier will be buried at a special ceremony in July to mark the 94th anniversary of the battle, he said. \"The new cemetery is a fitting resting place for these brave men, who made the ultimate sacrifice,\" he added. The Australian Department of Defence released photographs of some of the 75 men whose remains were identified. They include Cpl. Herbert Thomas Bolt of Sydney, Australia, of the 55th Battalion, who peers out from the picture wearing a slouch hat, a wide-brimmed hat pinned up on one side that is a trademark of the Australian Army. Private Henry Alfred Cressy, from New South Wales, of the 54th Battalion, sits for a portrait while wearing his military uniform. Private Clifford Dawson Holliday, also from New South Wales and the 54th Battalion, smiles in his picture while wearing a peaked cap. The men's ages were not immediately known. About 800 people from Britain and Australia who think they may have a relative buried at Fromelles have donated DNA to try to identify the bodies, said Peter Jones, the DNA consultant on the project. But that's only half as many as the experts need, he said, since about 1,600 Commonwealth dead from the battle remain unaccounted for. The Ministry of Defence urged people who believe they have a relative at Fromelles to get in touch. The 250 bodies being buried at Pheasant Wood are among the 1,600. Personal items found with the bodies have also helped experts identify them. In addition to military decorations, uniforms, and buttons, the items include personal effects such as a locket with a lock of hair, and a return ticket to Perth, Australia -- left on the body of a soldier who never lived to use it. A full list of the soldiers identified and also their photos is available on the Australian Department of Defence Web site.

The Cessna 206 single-engine aircraft went down about a half mile off the coast of Quebradillas. The man's body was found Monday less than 150 feet from shore, Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad said. The Coast Guard launched two more search missions Tuesday morning for four men and one woman still missing. Authorities have not released their identities, nor the name of the man found Monday. \"The Coast Guard will continue to search as long as there is the possibility of finding any survivors,\" Castrodad said. Eighteen divers will conduct searches Tuesday in the area where the body was found, the Coast Guard spokesman said. Volunteer divers from Arecibo found the body Monday, said Jose Daniel Echeverria, spokesman for the Puerto Rico Emergency Management Agency, which also is involved in the search. As of Tuesday, the Coast Guard will have conducted 12 search operations, eight done by four HH-65 Dolphin helicopters from Air Station Borinquen and four by the Cutter Matinicus, Castrodad said. The search is complicated, he said, by the roughness of the area. \"It's like a cliff,\" he said. \"The surf is very rough. It's hard to get in that area.\" Smaller boats from the emergency management agency and the Puerto Rico Police Joint Forces for Rapid Action are being used because they can reach areas that the Coast Guard cutter cannot, Castrodad said. The private plane, chartered by Tropical Aviation Corp., took off from the Dominican Republic and was on its way to an airport in Puerto Rico when it went down Sunday evening, officials said. The four males and one female onboard were returning to Puerto Rico after spending the weekend in the Dominican Republic, said Noemi Corporan, service manager for Tropical Aviation. The passengers were San Juan residents and had flown to the Dominican Republic on Friday, she said. The airplane took off from Casa de Campo International Airport in the Dominican Republic and was supposed to land at the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Marin International Airport in Carolina to clear U.S. customs before going on to the Isla Grande Airport in San Juan, the Coast Guard said. A 911 emergency operator notified the Coast Guard at 6:51 p.m. Sunday that an aircraft had crashed into the waters off Quebradillas. Searchers found a debris field in the area late Sunday. In the Dominican Republic, meanwhile, a man who said he spent the weekend with the missing passengers said he urged them not to leave Sunday night because of severe weather. Retired businessman Manuel \"Manolin\" Lecaroz, 64, told El Nuevo Dia newspaper that the group left because one of them had business to conduct Monday morning. He did not have a premonition, Lecaroz said. \"It's just that you can't fly when the weather is bad.\" The winds and heavy rains that were still being felt in Puerto Rico on Monday had ruined the group's chances to spend the weekend fishing and playing golf in the Dominican Republic, which is 79 miles (127 kilometers) away. \"It rained every day,\" Lecaroz told the Puerto Rican newspaper. \"The wind was blowing very hard, so much that we couldn't go out in the boat any day.\" As they left Sunday night, group members hugged Lecaroz and talked about returning later this month to fish and golf, he said.\n### Response :", "target": "Coast Guard launches search missions for five still missing after plane went down .\nDivers find man's body near shore of Quebradillas, Puerto Rico .\nSearch complicated by the roughness of the area, U.S. Coast Guard official says .\nSix onboard private plane returning to Puerto Rico from Dominican Republic .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Inside the house, the father used his body as a shield in trying to protect the other three children. Despite the father's efforts, the gunfire wounded two of his children: a 6-year-old boy in the pelvis and a 7-year-old girl in the chest. Both were in critical but stable condition, police said.

The oldest of four children, an 8-year-old boy, was the sole family member who wasn't injured, police said. \"What would motivate an individual to do this is inexplicable,\" Inglewood Police Chief Mark Fronterotta said. Inglewood is adjacent to Los Angeles and its international airport. Police were conducting a manhunt for the suspect, who lived in a house in the rear of the property. That rear house was also set afire, believed to have been ignited by the gunman, police said. Police did not release names of the father, 30; mother, 28; or their children as of Saturday afternoon. The incident occurred about 4 a.m. Saturday when police received a report of 10 gunshots at the property. The fire department also received a call at the same time.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the main idea?Attorneys and a federal judge are expected to meet in a North Carolina courtroom Friday afternoon for a status hearing regarding the pending criminal trial of John Edwards, the former presidential candidate and U.S. senator. The hearing comes after attorneys on both sides filed several motions, many of them sealed from the public. In December, attorneys for Edwards asked again to delay his criminal trial, saying Edwards had an unspecified medical issue. Last year, the Justice Department charged Edwards with conspiracy, issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws. He has pleaded not guilty. Last September, the trial was delayed until January 30 after Edwards' attorneys said he needed more time, in part due to his position as the sole caretaker of his two youngest children, ages 11 and 13, after his wife, Elizabeth, passed away in December 2010. The motion to continue the trial for 60 days filed on December 22 said Edwards' \"unexpected\" medical issue is explained in a sealed exhibit. The issue will \"prevent a trial of this matter during the January 2012 criminal term,\" according to the motion, and cannot be resolved before the end of the term. Attorneys for Edwards, who was the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2004 alongside John Kerry, also say in the motion a January trial would not give them enough time to prepare, especially given the \"unusual and complex\" prosecution. \"Since this trial date was set, the government has produced as part of the discovery process an additional 103,102 pages of material including more than 91,000 e-mails as well as 26 voicemails received by cooperating witnesses between 2007 and 2010,\" the motion says. In addition, both the government and Edwards are seeking evidence from North Carolina state courts. \"Absent a continuance, Mr. Edwards' counsel will not be able to effectively use the evidence the government was obligated to provide him ... and this, in turn, threatens Mr. Edwards' right to effective counsel and a fair trial,\" according to the motion. \"This is not hyperbole. Mr. Edwards' counsel are experienced trial lawyers and they are and have been working hard -- long hours, late nights and weekends -- and they have not made it their practice to seek unwarranted continuances.\" It is unclear if a decision has been made on whether the trial has been delayed. A chief issue in the upcoming trial is whether money given to support Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter, by the then-candidate's benefactors should have been considered campaign donations, a contention Edwards' team has disputed. They maintain the money was a gift to Hunter. If convicted on all counts, Edwards could face 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1.5 million.\n### Response:", "target": "The trial was set to start January 30 after a delay in September .\nEdwards' attorneys are asking for 60 more days .\nThey say they need time to review evidence provided by prosecutors .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Read the paragraph below, then write a summary of it. (CNN) -- A policeman and a former corrections officer say that on Friday they will unveil evidence of what they claim is their biggest find ever: the body of Bigfoot. The thawed body of a creature reputed to be Bigfoot reportedly weighs more than 500 pounds. Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer, a pair of Bigfoot-hunting hobbyists from north Georgia, say they found the creature's body in a wooded area and spotted several similar creatures that were still alive. The carcass of the furry half-man, half-ape is 7 feet, 7 inches tall and weighs more than 500 pounds, they say. However, the two are not disclosing the exact location of their discovery to protect the remaining creatures. Tom Nelson, chairman of the biology department at North Georgia College and State University in Dahlonega, said he's \"pretty skeptical\" the world will feast its eyes on a new species Friday. \"That would certainly rock mammalogy,\" joked Nelson, who specializes in the study of mammals. \"I see a research grant in my future.\" Whitton and Dyer plan to unveil what they say is DNA and photo evidence of the discovery in Palo Alto, California, in conjunction with a group called Searching for Bigfoot Inc. A photograph on that group's Web site shows what appears to be the body of a large, hairy creature with an ape-like face, stuffed into a large freezer. According to a written release, the two announced the discovery on an Internet radio show, \"Squatch Detective,\" several weeks ago. iReport.com: Do you believe in Bigfoot? \"The only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was 'the Real Bigfoot Hunter,' Tom Biscardi,\" Dyer said, referring to Searching for Bigfoot's CEO, who has been looking for the elusive, legendary creature in the United States and Canada since 1971. Whitton is a Georgia police officer who is on administrative leave after being shot in the wrist during a pursuit. Dyer is a former prison guard. DNA tests on the body have begun, said the statement, and \"extensive scientific studies\" will be done on the body by scientists, including a molecular biologist, an anthropologist and a paleontologist. Nelson, the university professor, acknowledged that new species of animals have been discovered in recent decades and that, in science, \"we always acknowledge the possibility of something new.\" But he said that even in north Georgia, home to the Blue Ridge Mountains and the foot of the Appalachian Trail, it stretches the imagination to think a family of 7-foot-tall creatures could have eluded hunters, hikers and creeping development until now. \"To the average person, these places just seem like extreme wilderness where you'll find lions and tigers and bears,\" he said. \"The reality is that you're never more than a mile from a road.\" The group says the animal is male, has reddish hair and \"blackish-gray\" eyes and human-like feet, hands and teeth.

{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.(CNN) -- State Sen. Wendy Davis' stand in Texas was the \"filibuster heard round the world\" -- suddenly everywhere you look, you see news about one state or another rolling back reproductive rights. Even as all eyes were on resumed hearings in Texas late Tuesday night, the North Carolina legislature was busy sneaking anti-choice measures into an unrelated bill, and Wednesday that bill passed the state Senate over the fierce objections of North Carolina women. But the more I read about what is happening to women's rights, the less I see about how anti-choice lawmakers are passing these bills. We're taught as kids that cheaters never win, but that lesson didn't sink in with Republican leaders in Texas and in many other states where these rights are under attack. Instead they've decided that if you don't have the people with you to pass a bill, you can just change the process. Take the Texas bill: a hodgepodge of arbitrary restrictions, it would close nearly 90% of the clinics that perform abortions in Texas, making it impossible for women across the state to access all sorts of medical care they need and deserve. It would also ban all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which compromises the moral and medical autonomy of women who need care. Following on 12 other states that have enacted the unconstitutional ban, Texas Republicans are trying to put in place costly restrictions to solve a problem that doesn't exist: The number of abortions after 20 weeks is tiny (less than 2%) and are most often sought by women in desperate circumstances, exactly the kind of cases that require close attention by doctors, not sweeping prohibitions by ideological politicians. The Republicans couldn't pass this bill in regular session -- Texas law requires a two-thirds Senate majority for these measures, and the GOP simply didn't have it. So instead of building support the old-fashioned way for this radical legislation, Gov. Perry decided he'd just change the rules. He called a special session after the end of the normal legislative period, and his friend, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, declared they no longer needed a super majority vote. What they didn't count on was opposition from citizens who knew the rules and wouldn't stand by while Republicans cheated. In the House, GOP committee members shut down legally mandated public hearings when witness after witness testified that they resented this intrusion into private, personal medical decisions; then committee members voted on the bill in a private room where the public couldn't see what they were doing. And finally, in the move that earned them national disdain, they tried to use every dirty trick in the book to shut down Davis' historic talking filibuster in the final hours of this widely watched session. They challenged the content of her speech. They cried crocodile tears about her receiving assistance to don a back brace. They ignored Democrats who were raising legitimate procedural questions. Republicans presiding over the debate recognized their fellow Republicans when Democrats had the floor. One senator, Leticia Van de Putte, even had to ask: \"At what point must a female senator raise her voice or hand to be recognized over the male colleagues in the room?\" And then, after Texans watching in the gallery erupted in jeers at the strong-handed tactics Republicans were using, the GOP leadership held a vote after midnight, after the special session had officially ended. They then changed the time stamp on the official record of the vote, only changing it back after they were caught red-handed. That meant the bill was dead, so Gov. Rick Perry did what cheaters do when they lose -- he called for a do-over. I wish I could say the tactics in Texas were the exception, but Republicans are using underhanded ploys like these to pass anti-choice bills all over the country. In Ohio, Republicans sneaked a requirement for unnecessary ultrasounds into a budget bill, without holding public hearings. In North Carolina, they shut out testimony from pro-choice activists late in the night to move their draconian measures to the floor for a vote. On Monday, I stood in the hot Austin sun with thousands of fellow Texans who share my outrage at this attack on our fundamental rights. But they didn't just cheer for Davis' stand to protect women's rights and health. They were there to celebrate the rule of democracy, rules that Republicans have shown they will change if it suits their political ends. But changing the rules doesn't change the truth. I don't know what will happen at this next special session in Texas, but I do know that if Republicans cheat their way to victory in this battle, they are going to lose the war for the confidence of the people they seek to represent.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the main idea?(CNN) -- A research team has identified two more sets of remains from unmarked graves at a former reformatory in Marianna, Florida, reported the University of South Florida. Thomas Varnadoe and Earl Wilson were the second and third students at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys identified through a DNA match, USF said in a press release issued Thursday. Wilson was the first African-American student identified . For years, stories circulated that boys were beaten, tortured and murdered at the school about 65 miles west of Tallahassee, Florida, but nobody was ever prosecuted. The school opened in 1900 and closed in 2011 for budgetary reasons. Records about who died at the school are sketchy, authorities have said, so an effort to locate and identify remains began several years ago. Investigators now say there's evidence 98 boys died at the school. Remains have been excavated from 55 unmarked graves, USF says. Thomas Varnadoe, 13, was sent to the school in September 1934 with his older brother, Hubert, USF said. According to USF, a death certificate said Thomas died of pneumonia 34 days after being admitted. His body was found very close to the body of George Owen Smith, the first student whose remains were identified, USF said. Thomas's remains were positively matched with DNA from his brother, Richard Varnadoe, USF said. Four students killed Earl Wilson, 12, a few days after he arrived at the school in August 1944, USF said. Medical evidence presented at the trial of the students listed the cause of death as blunt force trauma to the head, USF said. Results of the trial were not included in the press release.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?\n### Input:Milwaukee (CNN) -- My 91-year-old mother finds a lot of things aggravating. Drugstores that run out of things that are on sale. Typos. And phone calls from Mitt Romney. Quite a few phone calls from Mitt Romney. Also from Rick Santorum. And other people advocating for each of them. She's had enough. Also the television ads. Do they have to run so many? This is one time my mother and the rest of Wisconsin appear to be in sync. The political atmosphere that has prevailed since February 2011, when Republican Gov. Scott Walker launched his proposals to strip public employee unions of almost all of their power, remains supercharged. But as one big event follows another, with more coming soon, there is also a widespread sense that it's all getting to be too much. How much can one state take? A sense of political fatigue appears to be growing just as events are coming to a peak. Actually, they're coming to quite a few peaks, which is part of the problem. There's the peak that comes Tuesday, with the Republican presidential primary. Romney and Santorum, the two front-runners, have been up and down, particularly in the eastern half of Wisconsin the last few days. It's been rare in the last few decades for a Wisconsin primary to be consequential, but the general assumption is that if Romney beats Santorum, Romney will pretty much seal the deal as the GOP nominee. So this is kind of a big deal. Then there's the peak that will come over the next few weeks: a recall election in which Walker, who took office only 15 months ago, will face a Democratic challenger, quite possibly the person he defeated in November 2010, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. The recall, only the third for a governor in American history, was ordered after more than 900,000 people signed petitions. A Democratic primary with -- as it appears at the moment -- four candidates will be held on May 8, with a final election June 5. At the same time in recall-happy Wisconsin, Walker's lieutenant governor, Rebecca Kleefisch, will also face a recall, making her the first lieutenant governor in American history in that situation, and four state Senate seats held by Republicans will be involved in recall elections, with control of that house of the Wisconsin Legislature in the balance. Then there are the fall elections, with the strong prospect that Wisconsin will be a key battleground between President Barack Obama and the Republican nominee. Then there's an open seat for the U.S. Senate. Democratic Sen. Herb Kohl is retiring, and a heated Republican primary for that nomination is shaping up for August. So that totals up to major election days in April, May, June, August and November. It also means the prospect -- already being demonstrated -- of amazing amounts of campaign spending, much of it by independent groups; of robocalls inundating people across the state, and a level of television advertising that some experts say may leave Wisconsin viewers in the unenviable position of being exposed to more political spots in one year than virtually anyone else in U.S. history. It adds up to more than $100 million worth of political advertising in one state over 11 months. If one were to rank these election dates in order of interest, the Walker recall would be at the top of the stack. Tuesday's presidential primary may be a big deal in the national perspective, but it has been a relatively low-passion event at ground level. According to polls, Romney trailed Santorum in February; he was ahead in the last few days. Wisconsin has a large number of conservative voters, but the religiously motivated aren't as numerous as they are in Southern states, where Santorum has done well. Plus, it appears many Wisconsin Republicans, starting with powerful Rep. Paul Ryan, want to get the nomination race over and unite behind Romney. As in other places, support of Romney doesn't appear to mean high enthusiasm. The Walker recall, on the other hand, carries huge implications for Wisconsin's political climate for at least the next few years. Walker remains a polarizing figure like few who have ever crossed the landscape of the state. In almost any conversation with people who are not directly working in campaigns, the exhaustion factor comes up quickly. When will it all end? How many more ads can we take? How bottomless are the checkbooks of donors, especially the small- to midlevel donors? These concerns are sort of like the old Yogi Berra line about the restaurant that nobody goes to anymore because it's too crowded. Wisconsinites are worn down precisely because so much is going on, so many people are in various forms of uproar, and the parade of amazing political events doesn't seem to stop. But in a state that historically has had very high voter turnout, one of the things that will be important to watch in coming months is how many people come to the polls. Will turnout begin to droop? If so, to whose advantage or disadvantage? At what point does fatigue become a major player on the battlefield of Wisconsin politics, and a 91-year-old woman who would prefer some political peace and quiet become a key opinion leader? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alan J. Borsuk.\n### Response :", "target": "Alan Borsuk: Wisconsin politics in overdrive, with convergence of high-drama elections .\nComing up, he says, are Tuesday's primary, recall votes, primaries for their opponents .\nBorsuk: Fall vote, open Senate seat mean Wisconsinites are suffering from political fatigue .\nPeople are sick to death of deluge of political ads and robocalls, Borsuk says .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given review.\n### Input:WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Security experts are questioning information released by the Pentagon last week, saying 61 former detainees from its detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, may have returned to terrorist activities. President Obama has signed an executive order to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility. The report, released days before President Obama took office, says 18 former detainees are confirmed to have participated in attacks, and 43 are suspected to have been involved in attacks. That figure would be about 11 percent of the roughly 520 prisoners who have been released from the Guantanamo facility, which Obama on Thursday ordered be shut down. On Friday, a Pentagon spokesman defended the integrity of the report but would not directly answer questions about where the figures come from. \"We don't make these figures up. They're not done willy-nilly,\" spokesman Geoff Morrell said. Pentagon officials have said they would not discuss how the statistics were derived because of security concerns that such information could give clues to how U.S. intelligence officers collect their data. \"It is painstakingly done by the Defense Intelligence Agency, and they go over this with great care,\" Morrell said. He said evidence of someone being \"confirmed\" to have returned to terrorism could include fingerprints, a conclusive photograph or \"well-corroborated intelligence reporting.\" CNN has learned that some former Guantanamo detainees have returned to the fight. An al Qaeda video viewed by CNN's Nic Robertson showed militants labeled with their former prisoner numbers. Saeed Shihri, Prisoner No. 372, is believed to have been responsible for an attack on the U.S. embassy in Yemen that killed nearly a dozen people in September, barely a year after he was released from Guantanamo. A U.S. counter-terrorism expert said Shihri is one of al Qaeda's top leaders in Yemen.  Watch former Gitmo detainee train with al Qaeda \u00bb . Others have included Abdullah Mahsud, who blew himself up to avoid capture by Pakistani forces in July 2007, and Ruslan Anatolivich Odizhev, who was transferred to Russia in March 2004 and killed in a June 2007 gunbattle with Russian security forces. Peter Bergen, a national security expert and CNN analyst, notes that of the 18 people the Pentagon says are confirmed to have engaged in terrorism, only a handful of names have been released. If one accepts that all 18 on the \"confirmed\" list have returned to the battlefield, that would be 4 percent of the detainees who have been released, Bergen said. Bergen also noted Federal Bureau of Justice Statistics data that show the recidivism rate for U.S. state prisoners who have been released is more than 65 percent. Those same numbers show that about half of the released prisoners are returned to prison. Bergen said that some of the prisoners at Guantanamo may not have been terrorists at all but were singled out by vengeful villagers who told U.S. authorities they were al Qaeda. \"We know that a lot of people who were in Guantanamo don't qualify as being the 'worst of the worst,'\" he said, quoting former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's assessment. Bergen said some of those \"suspected\" to have returned to terrorism are so categorized because they publicly made anti-American statements, \"something that's not surprising if you've been locked up in a U.S. prison camp for several years.\" In a briefing Thursday, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates -- an advocate for closing Guantanamo while serving under President Bush and, now, under President Obama -- seemed to downplay the number of former detainees who have returned to fighting. \"It's not as big a number if you're talking about 700 or a thousand or however many have been through Guantanamo,\" he said. As the Pentagon begins the work of closing the facility and finding places to send, or release, detainees there, Gates stressed that security will remain his top concern. \"Clearly, the challenge that faces us, and that I've acknowledged before, is figuring out how do we close Guantanamo and, at the same time, safeguard the security of the American people,\" he said. \"That's the challenge that we will continue to face.\" CNN's Mike Mount at the Pentagon and Brian Todd contributed to this report.\n### Response: ", "target": "Questions arise over report 61 Gitmo detainees have returned to terrorist activities .\nPentagon defends report but says it cannot explain where figure comes from .\nPresident Obama has ordered Guantanamo Bay facility to be closed .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Read the following passage and summarize it.\n### Input:(CNN) -- More than 115,000 volunteers have joined the crowdsourcing search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane by going to their computers and reviewing satellite photos of the open ocean to find signs of the aircraft, a sponsor said Wednesday. In all, these humanitarian-minded volunteers have posted 100 million page views in the first 34 hours since the crowdsourcing campaign began this week. The public was viewing 2 million pages of satellite imagery every 10 minutes on Wednesday, said a senior director of a Longmont, Colorado, the firm that is leading the Internet effort. The volunteers are assisting the experts now in Malaysia and its surrounding ocean by looking for any sign of the commercial airliner. But as of Wednesday, the amateurs online hadn't had any luck. \"Up until now, there hasn't been the smoking gun, the final clue, that leads to the location of the wreckage of the missing aircraft,\" said Shay Har-Noy, founder of DigitalGlobe's tomnod.com, where the online searches are being conducted. It wasn't immediately clear whether authorities in Malaysia were aware of the crowdsourcing effort or chasing any leads identified by volunteers. However, search experts were examining Wednesday the findings of a Chinese satellite that \"observed a suspected crash area at sea,\" a Chinese government agency said. The Chinese imagery marked a potential big break in the frustrating search for the Boeing 777. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has become such an international mystery that Internet do-gooders have mobilized a \"crowdsourcing campaign\" poring over DigitalGlobe's satellite photos -- all in the effort to find any trace of a plane floating in the Gulf of Thailand. The task, however, is like the cliched search for a needle in a haystack. \"We have found a lot of really interesting pieces of debris, lots of ships,\" which are involved in the search, Har-Noy told CNN on Wednesday. \"We can see from space all the boats and the infrastructure that's in place\" for the open sea hunt, said Har-Noy, also a senior director for geospatial big data for DigitalGlobe, which acquired tomnod.com last year. So many people are tantalized by the mystery and want to help in the search -- online, at least -- that they have crashed the website several times in the past couple of days. \"Yes, yesterday we had a quite a bit of trouble keeping up with the volume,\" Har-Noy said. \"The response has been extraordinary.\" In fact, scores of volunteers have posted their findings from tomnod.com on their CNN iReport pages, which is CNN's own version of crowdsourcing, sometimes used in the news outlet's coverage of world events. One CNN iReporter, Mike Seberger, early in the crowdsourcing campaign spotted an image in one satellite photograph that appears to be a commercial airliner floating in the ocean -- though Seberger concedes the silhouette also resembles a boat. His discovery, however, has apparently turned out to be a false alarm -- especially in the wake of Har-Noy's declaration Wednesday that none of the online tips has yet yielded a major clue. Seberger's flagging of the interesting image, however, went viral, and in the span of a couple of days, his iReport page is now ranked the eighth most popular of all-time, between a Hurricane Sandy posting and a Super Typhoon Haiyan photo.

{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.\n### Input:(CNN) -- Every day millions of women apply lipstick without a second thought. What many don't know is that lipsticks may contain lead, the notorious metal that can cause learning, language and behavioral problems. Lead is a neurotoxin and can be dangerous even at small doses. So what's lead doing in lipsticks? Not all lipsticks contain lead, but a number of studies in recent years show that the metal is more prevalent than previously thought. In 2007, the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics conducted a study -- \"A Poison Kiss\" -- that detected lead in 61% of the 33 lipsticks tested, with levels ranging from 0.03 ppm to 0.65 ppm. Parts per million (ppm) is the measurement of lead in the environment. Medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the blood. The FDA says it doesn't consider the lead levels it found in lipsticks to be a safety issue. No lipstick lists lead as an ingredient. The amounts are small, but the presence of lead in lipstick, which is ingested and absorbed through the skin, raises concerns about the safety of a cosmetic product that is wildly popular among women. Urged on by both consumers and the cosmetics industry, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted its own testing in 2010. The FDA's results were even more astonishing: The agency detected lead in all 400 lipsticks tested, ranging from 0.9 to 3.06 ppm -- four times higher than the levels observed in the study done by Campaign for Safe Cosmetics. And lead isn't the only toxic metal you may be applying to your lips. In a recent study, University of California researchers tested eight lipsticks and 24 lip glosses and detected nine toxic heavy metals, including chromium, cadmium, manganese, aluminum and lead. The FDA said, \"We have assessed the potential for harm to consumers from use of lipstick containing lead at the levels found in both rounds of testing. Lipstick, as a product intended for topical use with limited absorption, is ingested only in very small quantities. We do not consider the lead levels we found in the lipsticks to be a safety concern.\" Likewise, the cosmetics industry also doesn't see this as an issue, saying that the dose makes the poison -- in other words, the trace amounts of heavy metals in lipsticks are not harmful. But the FDA noted, \"Although we do not believe that the lead content found in our recent lipstick analyses poses a safety concern, we are evaluating whether there may be a need to recommend an upper limit for lead in lipstick in order to further protect the health and welfare of consumers. \" Indeed, what the FDA and the cosmetics industry have been ignoring is cumulative exposure and potential long-term adverse effects. It's true that a single lipstick application will not lead to harm. And the good news is that not all lipsticks contain detectable levels of lead or other heavy metals. (And by the way, cost doesn't seem to be a factor; a cheap or expensive lipstick isn't the determinant of how much lead is present.) The problem is when women who wear lipstick apply it two to 14 times a day, according to the University of California study. The result is that they are ingesting and absorbing through their lips as much as 87 milligrams of product a day, the study says. Women are not only applying their lipsticks several times a day, but they also are doing this in the span of a whole lifetime, which means that exposure to lead and other heavy metals adds up and can potentially affect their health. One challenge for people wanting to avoid exposure is that none of the metals, with the exception of aluminum, are deliberately added to lipsticks and lip glosses. The metals are contaminants that are present in the pigments and base materials used to make the products. Because the metals are not ingredients, cosmetics companies are not required to list them on products' ingredient labels. The law regulating cosmetics passed Congress in 1938 and has never been updated. The FDA possesses no legal authority to make sure products are safe before they are sold. Nor is the agency empowered to pull dangerous products from store shelves. It's the Wild West for cosmetics companies, which have very few rules restricting chemical ingredients used in everything from shampoos to lotions to lipsticks. As the contamination of lip products with heavy metals makes it clear, allowing the industry to police itself is not the best idea. We need the FDA to be empowered by Congress and to take action so women won't face any health risks when they put on makeup. Cosmetics companies should be required to adhere to a standard for best manufacturing processes to limit metal contamination. For now, consumers should take precautions to protect themselves from heavy metal exposure from lip products. First, use less. If you find yourself reapplying lipstick 14 times a day, consider cutting back. Second, don't let children use lipstick, as their young bodies are especially vulnerable to toxic metals. Then let's get to work to make sure that by the time they've grown up, we have solved the problem of toxic chemicals in cosmetics.\n### Response : ", "target": "Sharima Rasanayagam: Studies found higher level of lead in some lipsticks .\nRasanayagam: This raises concerns about the safety of a popular product .\nShe says FDA and cosmetic industry should pay attention to long-term effects .\nRasanayagam: Congress needs to update the laws regulating cosmetics .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Laborers work on a construction site in a fishing village in Indonesia's Aceh on December 21. Hundreds of thousands were left homeless and jobless after the tsunami, and poor and isolated communities were left even worse off. Today, new schools have been constructed, and armies of workers -- many of them volunteers -- have cleared and rebuilt homes and towns, and helped get people back to work. \"The tsunami, despite being a horrific event, also provided a lot of opportunities for those countries,\" said Jonathan Cauldwell, chief of UNICEF's Tsunami Transition Support. \"It brought a peace dividend within Banda Aceh (Indonesia) where you still see peace in an area which had long term localized conflict in place. It allowed those areas to be built up as well, to have investments in the infrastructure in the social sectors ...,\" he added. Agencies such as UNICEF said that while the immediate emergency was over, they remain committed to improving the lives of millions of children across the region. \"The lessons of the tsunami will never end. The funding will end, we can complete the construction, we can complete the project, but the intervention never ends ...,\" Cauldwell said. Oxfam International, which said it will close its response to the tsunami at the end of December, said it has provided housing to tsunami survivors in Aceh, helped restore the livelihoods of people in India and Sri Lanka, and funded the reconstruction of eight tsunami-affected secondary schools. \"The money we received allowed us not only to help meet the immediate emergency needs of tsunami-affected populations, but also to try to address the factors that made them vulnerable: not least poverty and a lack of influence over their own lives,\" Barbara Stocking, chair of the Oxfam International Tsunami Fund Board, said in a statement. \"What has been achieved is astounding. Hundreds of thousands of people are now living in better conditions than they were in before the tsunami ...,\" she added. UNICEF said the basic needs of children affected by the tsunami have been met -- more children are going to school as a result of improved facilities, and better nutrition, post-natal care and other life-saving interventions are helping those countries worst hit transition to developing regular services and programs. But long-term improvement of water and sanitation is critical, the agency said, and so is building new schools that are better able to withstand earthquakes.

Given the perfect ride by jockey Thierry Jarnet, 11-1 shot Treve stormed to the front in the final furlong to win from Flintshire and favored English filly Taghrooda. Unbeatable as a three-year-old, Treve had been winless after being kept in training, until giving a timely reminder of the old sporting adage that form is temporary, class is permanent. It was a fairytale victory for her trainer Criquette Head-Maarek, who has twice beaten life-threatening illnesses, and knew her horse had similar fighting qualities. She controversially took the decision to take famous jockey Frankie Dettori off the filly, replacing him with Jarnet, who rode Treve to the 2013 success and was winning his fourth Arc. \"This is a great personal satisfaction for me,\" said the 66-year-old from the famous Head racing dynasty, who have secured a string of Arc victories over the years as jockeys and trainers. Her grandfather William Head and father Alec trained two and four Arc winners respectively, while brother Freddie won three as a jockey. Head-Maarek has now trained three winners, the first back in 1979 before Treve's double triumph, but she believes this is her greatest achievement. \"It is the best race I have ever won with all the problems with her back and hoof and criticism aimed at her. This is brilliant, I'm not yet back down to earth yet! It is my best day,\" she added . Treve is only the seventh horse to win successive Arcs and the first since the Vincent O'Brien-trained Alleged was ridden to a 1978 success by legendary English jockey Lester Piggott. Andre Fabre's Flintshire rode a strong race, ahead of Oaks and King George heroine Taghrooda and St. Leger winner Kingston Hill. But the three-pronged Japanese challenge never materialized with Harp Star the best finisher in sixth place.

John McCain of a \"pathetic attempt\" to play the gender card. Barack Obama used the \"lipstick\" line at a campaign event in Lebanon, Virginia, on Tuesday. McCain's campaign said Obama's remarks were offensive and a slap at Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin -- despite the fact that the Arizona senator himself used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of Hillary Clinton's. Obama shot back Wednesday and accused the McCain campaign of engaging in \"lies\" and \"swift boat politics.\" \"I don't care what they say about me. But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics,\" he said in Norfolk, Virginia. \"Enough is enough.\"  Watch Obama deliver his harsh words \u00bb . The phrase \"swift boat\" comes from the 2004 presidential election, when the group \"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\" launched an attack ad campaign against Democratic candidate John Kerry. Read more about what Obama said . Obama made his controversial \"lipstick\" remarks at a Virginia campaign stop late Tuesday afternoon.   Watch what happens with politics and lipstick collide \u00bb . \"John McCain says he's about change too, and so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out George Bush -- except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy and Karl Rove-style politics -- we're really going to shake things up in Washington,'\" he said. \"That's not change. That's just calling something the same thing something different. You know you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. You know you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it's still going to stink after eight years. We've had enough of the same old thing.\"  Watch how tensions are rising on the trail \u00bb . The crowd erupted in applause when Obama delivered the line. The Illinois senator then praised both McCain's \"compelling story\" and Palin's \"interesting story,\" and said his \"hat goes off\" to anyone who's looking after five kids -- \"I've got two and they tire Michelle and me out. ... \"That's why John McCain's campaign manager [Rick Davis] said this campaign isn't going to be about issues, this campaign is going to be about personalities.\" Within minutes, the McCain campaign announced a conference call focused on the remark, which they said was a deliberate reference to Palin's line: \"You know the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? Lipstick.\" Palin used the line in the opening remarks of her convention speech, and she frequently uses it on the campaign trail. In Iowa last October, McCain drew comparisons between Hillary Clinton's current health care plan and the one she championed in 1993: \"I think they put some lipstick on the pig, but it's still a pig.\" He used roughly the same line in May, after effectively claiming the Republican nomination. McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told CNN the campaign saw a \"big difference\" between the two references: \"McCain was referring to a policy proposal. Obama was referring to [Alaska] Gov. Sarah Palin. It's obviously disrespectful and offensive. ... \"Who has been talking about lipstick lately? It was obvious. The crowd went crazy because of it.\" It wasn't the first time Obama used the line. In a phone interview with The Washington Post last September, he used it in reference to the situation in Iraq. \"I think that both Gen. [David] Petraeus and Ambassador [Ryan] Crocker are capable people who have been given an impossible assignment,\" Obama told the Post. \"George Bush has given a mission to Gen. Petraeus, and he has done his best to try to figure out how to put lipstick on a pig.\" Other politicians have also used the phrase in recent years, including Vice President Dick Cheney, Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Rep. John Mica of Florida and Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado, among others. Torie Clarke, a former McCain adviser, even wrote a book called, \"Lipstick on a Pig: Winning In the No-Spin Era by Someone Who Knows the Game.\" Still, the McCain campaign says Obama's use was intentional, and they want an apology. \"Barack Obama's comments today are offensive and disgraceful. He owes Gov. Palin an apology,\" said Maria Comella, a McCain-Palin spokeswoman. Obama's campaign said \"enough is enough\" and accused McCain of running a \"dishonorable campaign.\" \"The McCain campaign's attack tonight is a pathetic attempt to play the gender card about the use of a common analogy -- the same analogy that Sen. McCain himself used about Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's health care plan just last year,\" said Obama campaign senior adviser Anita Dunn. \"This phony lecture on gender sensitivity is the height of cynicism and lays bare the increasingly dishonorable campaign John McCain has chosen to run.\" McCain ally Mike Huckabee took Obama's side on the issue, saying he didn't think it was a swipe at Palin. \"It's an old expression, and I'm going to have to cut Obama some slack on that one. I do not think he was referring to Sarah Palin; he didn't reference her. If you take the two sound bites together, it may sound like it,\" he said on Fox's \"Hannity and Colmes.\" \"But I've been a guy at the podium many times, and you say something that's maybe a part of an old joke and then somebody ties it in. So, I'm going to have to cut him slack.\" But McCain's campaign is not about to let the issue go. They released a Web ad Wednesday that plays Obama's lipstick comments, then asks, \"Ready to lead? No. Ready to smear? Yes.\" CNN's Rebecca Sinderbrand, Sasha Johnson and Chris Welch contributed to this report.\n### Response:", "target": "NEW: Barack Obama slams Republicans for \"lies\" and \"swift boat politics\"\nObama said Tuesday \"You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig\"\nMcCain camp says line was an attack on Palin; Obama camp says it was not .\nMany politicians have used the line; former McCain adviser used it in her book title .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.\n### Input:Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The U.S.-led war in Afghanistan marked its 10th year Friday having passed two major milestones: The Taliban has been forced out of power and Osama bin Laden is dead. But there was little observance by U.S. troops in Afghanistan, where a month earlier many participated in commemorations to mark the 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. \"We really celebrated the 10th anniversary of 9/11, and we were out here in Afghanistan,\" Marine Corps Maj. Gen. John Toolan Jr., commanding general of ISAF troops in southern Afghanistan, told reporters during a briefing on Thursday. \"I think that to us it was a far more significant date than 10 years of fighting in Afghanistan because, really, when you look at the 10 years, you're looking at different levels of forces, different levels of attention given to Afghanistan.\" The U.S.-led war in Afghanistan began October 7, 2011, with an air campaign that was followed within weeks by a ground invasion. President Barack Obama has called it \"the longest-running war in the nation's history\". The aim was to oust the Taliban and dismantle al Qaeda's leadership, though the leaders of both groups -- Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden -- managed to escape capture. Bin Laden was killed in May during a raid by U.S. commandos on his hideout in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The whereabouts of Mullah Omar is unknown, and he has not been seen in public in years. As the United States turned its attention toward Iraq, insurgent violence in Afghanistan flared against Afghan civilians and security forces as well as the U.S. and its coalition partners. More than 2,700 troops from the United States and its partners have died during the 10 years of war, according to a CNN count. Of those, 1,780 were American, 382 were British and 157 were Canadian. Since the conflict began, the number of casualties has risen by the year, with a significant jump from 2008 to 2009. At least 296 coalition troops died in 2008. It nearly doubled in 2009 when 517 coalition troops were killed. That year, President Barack Obama authorized a surge of 33,000 U.S. forces to Afghanistan to combat the violence. Two years later, the United States outlined its plan to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, beginning with pulling the 33,000 surge troops by the end of 2012 and the remaining 68,000 by the end of 2014. The move was followed by withdrawal announcements by most of the NATO nations. On Thursday, defense ministers from the 49 nations that make up the International Security Assistance Force pledged their support to Afghanistan even as they make plans to withdraw troops by 2014. \"Let there be no mistake: transition is not departure. We will not take our leave when the Afghans take the lead,\" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told reporters Thursday in Brussels, Belgium. The ministers are scheduled to meet again in May in Chicago where Rasmussen said they will \"need to decide what more we will do.\" While NATO has insisted that the transition of security for the country to Afghan forces is conditions-based rather than calendar-driven, the clock is ticking on the withdrawal deadline. The planned withdrawal has raised a number of questions about the stability of Afghanistan, which has been hit by a wave of high-profile attacks in recent months that have jeopardized the peace negotiations. Last month's turban bomb assassination of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, revered by many as a father of the Mujahideen movement that ousted the Soviets in the 1980s, appears to have dealt the biggest blow to the peace process. Rabbani was the chairman of President Hamid Karzai's High Council for Peace, which has been trying for a year to foster dialogue with the Taliban -- a strategy that Karzai publicly abandoned following Rabbani's killing. The war in Afghanistan, once viewed by a majority of Americans as a must, has become widely unpopular as concerns have shifted to the economy and job losses. In a new Pew Research Center report on war and sacrifice released this week, half of post-9/11 veterans said the Afghanistan war has been worth fighting. Only 44% felt that way about Iraq, and one-third said both wars were worth the costs. Robert Messel is among those veterans who question the war. Messel, who was a freshman in college and a ROTC student on September 11, 2001, said he remembers thinking that the war in Afghanistan would be over before he joined the Army. But as the war continued, Messel said he began to have mixed feelings. \"I joined to defend the country, and I feel that a lot of the things we were doing were not exactly that,\" he said in a CNN iReport. \"In my opinion, it basically should have been limited to what we initially were going in to do: Hunt down bin Laden and the architects of the attacks.\" Messel said it is very difficult to look back objectively on the experience. \"You lost friends and made sacrifices. You don't want to ever think that everything that happened was in vain,\" he said. But Asmatullah Kohistani has a different perspective on the war, which he says gave his family back their home and their livelihoods. He was 13 when he and his family fled their home in Afghanistan's Kapisa province amid a civil war that would see the Taliban take control of the country. Driven out by bombardments and fighting, his family crossed into Pakistan, making their home in Islamabad. Kohistani, 28, said \"everything changed\" after the Taliban were forced from power. Kohistani, who worked for a U.S. business for two years upon his return to Afghanistan, founded media startup Afghan123.com last year. \"(E)veryone can have a job and go to school (now), and I can have my business,\" he said in a CNN iReport.\n### Response :", "target": "The U.S.-led war in Afghanistan began October 7, 2001, with an air campaign .\nMore than 2,700 NATO troops have died during the war, according to a CNN count .\nOf those killed, 1,780 are American, 382 are British and 157 are Canadian, according to the count .\nThe U.S. and most NATO nations have announced plans to withdraw troops from Afghanistan by 2014 .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Rapper M.I.A. provided a middle finger salute to network cameras Sunday night during the 12-minute extravaganza, when she joined Madonna during a performance of the latter's new single, \"Give Me All Your Luvin'.\" The apologies from the NFL and the broadcaster, NBC, came quickly -- they blamed each other. \"There was a failure in NBC's delay system,\" said Brian McCarty, the league's vice president of communications. \"The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans.\" \"The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show,\" NBC said. \"Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers.\" The episode was reminiscent of the 2004 Super Bowl when singer Janet Jackson's nipple was briefly exposed during a performance with singer Justin Timberlake. The infamous \"wardrobe malfunction\" episode, as it came to be known, prompted the Federal Communications Commission to fine broadcaster CBS $550,000. In November, a divided 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the FCC improperly punished the network. Since then, the NFL has maintained tight control over the show's production. After the Jackson-Timberlake showstopper, the halftime show largely relied on classic rock artists such as Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones, The Who and Tom Petty. Fast forward to Sunday when the New England Patriots were again playing in the big game, just as in 2004. M.I.A., along with Nicki Minaj, Cee-Lo Green and LMFAO, joined Madonna as she treated fans to a greatest hits medley that included \"Vogue,\" \"Music\" and \"Like a Prayer.\" The \"spontaneous gesture,\" as NBC called it, came during a performance of Madonna's latest single. M.I.A. not only flipped her middle finger but uttered, \"I don't give a sh*t.\" A source close to M.I.A. said the rapper \"was nervous and not thinking, and adrenaline took over.\" \"It wasn't meant as a gesture or statement of any kind,\" said the source, who is not authorized to speak on the record. \"She feels horrible for putting Madonna in that position. She messed up.\" The Parents Television Council, a nonprofit group that advocates for family friendly programming, blamed the mishap on both NBC and the NFL. \"They chose a lineup full of performers who have based their careers on shock, profanity and titillation,\" the group's president, Tim Winter, said in a statement. \"Instead of preventing indecent material, they enabled it.\" Madonna did not issue a comment. But on Twitter, where the halftime show generated 8,000 tweets per second, the reaction was swift and mixed. \"What was that singer M.I.A. thinking?! Flipping off America during halftime can't be a good career move,\" Will Ripley of Denver tweeted. But Devon Soltendieck of Montreal was less concerned. \"Can we all stop pretending #MIA flipping the Finger during the halftime show is offensive in 2012?\" he asked. Said Josh Jackson, editor in chief of the music magazine Paste: \"M.I.A. Didn't flip us all off. She just had a middle finger malfunction.\" CNN's K.J. Matthews contributed to this report .\n### Response: ", "target": "NEW: Rapper M.I.A. was \"nervous and not thinking,\" a source says .\nNBC says its system was late to obscure the gesture .\nThe NFL says the gesture was inappropriate and disappointing .\nThe halftime show generated 8,000 tweets per second .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Read the paragraph below, then write a summary of it. \n### Input:Bad news, guys: The pangolin we adopted is missing. You may recall a vote I held online recently -- asking readers to suggest new names for pangolin P26, who was released into a national park in Vietnam in March. The names you suggested were lovely: Pemalu, which is Indonesian for \"shy\"; Bao, which is Vietnamese for \"protection.\" And -- Sandshrew, a scale-covered Pokemon character that even I'll admit does bear a striking resemblance to a real-life panoglin. Of course, since you're the Internet, you voted up Sandshrew. So that's P26's new name. And now Sandshrew is missing. I'm not drawing any correlation between the two. Obviously. Of course not ... Let me back up in case you haven't been following this story: Pangolins are thought to be the most trafficked mammals in the world. They're traded illegally and by the ton for their scales, which are used in traditional medicine and for their meat, which is a delicacy in Vietnam and China. I recently spent some time investigating the pangolin trade in Southeast Asia as part of CNN's Change the List project. One pangolin I met was named P26 -- and had been seized from the illegal trade and taken to the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program in Vietnam. He recently was released into Cat Tien National Park. I thought it would be fun for CNN's audience to adopt and rename the pangolin, and the researchers who care for him kindly agreed. Turns out, the researchers kind of like the name Sandshrew. \"I guess it is kinda cute(ish),\" one wrote in an e-mail. \"Well, anything is better than P26 right?!\" And they think it might help with his rescue. In a Wednesday blog post, Louise Fletcher, from the conservation program, wrote that P26's (sorry, Sandshrew's) radio tracking device had partially fallen off his tail. This happens quite a lot with this type of pangolin, she told me. The transmitting devices are fairly clunky, and they're screwed into a scale that's made of fingernail material. Now, she is scouring the forest trying to find him. She's set up \"camera traps\" that might snap a photo of the nocturnal animal if he's roaming around at night, looking for ants. And she's spending some time just wandering the park at night hoping to see him. No luck so far. \"Maybe if the voting by CNN readers is complete on deciding P26\u2032s new name, I can see if whispering it as we walk through the forest on Thursday night will be successful in coaxing him into view!\" she wrote. Maybe! I hope so. I sent her an e-mail telling her the new name for P26 is Sandshrew. I'm holding out hope that Fletcher will find him by whispering \"Saaaandshrewwwww\" into the forest of Vietnam. I kind of love imagining that scene, and wish her luck. If you want to follow her progress, and Sandshrew's, check out her blog. And thanks to everyone who voted. One more favor to ask: Maybe the fact that there's a real-life endangered creature named after a video game character means Nintendo and Pokemon will start supporting pangolin conservation? Maybe someone can suggest that by starting a Change.org petition? So far, more than 4,000 people have signed a reader's petition asking for Disney to put a pangolin in a movie. Maybe there's a similarly creative ask for Pokemon?

Creigh Deeds a day before the fight that left his son dead and the veteran politician with multiple stab wounds, investigators reported Wednesday. Deputies responded to a \"nonemergency call for assistance\" at Deeds' home in Millboro, in the rural western part of the state, on Monday, Virginia State Police said. The deputies made no arrests, and no charges were filed, the agency said. A police source confirmed that Deeds' son, Austin \"Gus\" Deeds, was taken to a local hospital under an emergency custody order for an evaluation by mental health professionals. The following morning, Deeds was stabbed multiple times during a fight with his 24-year-old son, who then shot himself with a rifle, according to autopsy results state police disclosed Wednesday. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported Tuesday that the younger Deeds had been given a mental health evaluation under an emergency custody order. But Dennis Cropper, executive director of the Rockbridge Area Community Services Board, said that Austin Deeds had been released because no psychiatric bed could be found for him across a wide area of western Virginia, the newspaper reported. But three hospitals in the area told CNN Wednesday that they had beds available, and no one called them. All three are within an hour or two of the Deeds family home in Millboro, about 150 miles west of Richmond. Mental health: Warning signs parents can't ignore . Virginia law requires doctors to find a bed for a patient under an emergency custody order within four hours or release them. Sources close to the investigation told CNN that Deeds, the 2009 Democratic nominee for governor, was stabbed more than 10 times. He was in good condition Wednesday afternoon the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville. A cousin found the bleeding lawmaker walking down a road near his home after the fight and called for help, state police said. State troopers who went to Deeds' home found Gus Deeds suffering from a gunshot wound and were unable to save him, state police said Tuesday. The incident stunned the political community in Virginia, where Deeds is a well-known lawmaker who ran for attorney general and governor. The man who defeated him in both races, current Gov. Bob McDonnell, called Tuesday's events \"heartbreaking.\" CNN's Chris Lawrence, Leslie Bentz and Lesa Jansen contributed to this report.\n### Response:", "target": "Sheriff's deputies were called to Creigh Deeds' home on Monday, state police say .\nA police source said Deeds' son was taken to a hospital for evaluation .\nThree hospitals tell CNN they had psychiatric beds available Monday .\nThe Virginia state senator was stabbed more than 10 times, sources say .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

William Kyle Carpenter the Medal of Honor later this year in recognition of Carpenter\u2019s heroic actions during a November 2010 grenade attack in Afghanistan, according to a Marine Corps Times report, which cited unnamed officials as sources. \n  \n Spokespersons for the Marine Corps and the White House would not confirm the status of Carpenter\u2019s case to Stars and Stripes, pending a potential White House announcement. \n  \n Carpenter, 24, would be the 10th U.S. servicemember \u2014 and the second Marine \u2014 to receive the Medal of Honor from the war in Afghanistan. \n  \n Carpenter was nominated for the nation\u2019s highest award for valor following reports that he covered a grenade to save the life of his friend, Lance Cpl. Nicholas Eufrazio, during an insurgent attack in the Marjah district of Helmand province as the two Marines were standing guard on a rooftop on Nov. 21, 2010. Carpenter and Eufrazio survived the blast, but suffered severe wounds. Carpenter lost an eye and most of his teeth and shattered his jaw; his arm was also broken in several places. \n  \n Damage from shrapnel to the frontal lobe of Eufrazio\u2019s brain left him unable to speak for two years. \n  \n The Marine Corps investigation of the incident to determine whether Carpenter deserved the award was complicated by several factors: There were no other witnesses, Carpenter couldn\u2019t remember what happened because of trauma and Eufrazio was unable to speak until late 2012. \n  \n But Marines who were deployed with Carpenter told the Marine Corps Times that they believed Carpenter took the brunt of the grenade blast to save Eufrazio because of the nature of the wounds he sustained. Petty Officer 3rd Class Christopher Frend, the Navy corpsman who triaged the two Marines, said the blast seat of the grenade \u2014 which indicates the detonation location \u2014 was found on Carpenter\u2019s torso. Frend said Carpenter\u2019s injury would have been different if the grenade had exploded on top of him instead of under him, which suggests that Carpenter smothered the grenade with his body. \n  \n In 2011, the state legislature of South Carolina, Carpenter\u2019s home state, passed a resolution honoring Carpenter for his service and sacrifices, citing his reported actions during the grenade attack. \n  \n After a long recovery and more than 30 surgeries, Carpenter ran the Marine Corps Marathon last year and posted a time of 4:28:42, according to the \u2018Operation Kyle\u2019 Facebook page, which was created by Carpenter\u2019s supporters. \n  \n \u201cIt\u2019s hard to comprehend that three years ago today my life and body was torn apart by an enemy hand grenade on a hot dusty rooftop in Afghanistan,\ufffd?

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the central ideas presented?Los Angeles (CNN) -- They came seeking justice as the sun rose Tuesday over a courthouse in the heart of downtown Los Angeles made famous by its celebrity trials -- O.J. Simpson, Snoop Dogg, Phil Spector. But there were almost as many definitions of justice as there were justice seekers. Some shouted \"Murderer!\" as the defendant, Conrad Murray, arrived at the Clara Foltz Justice Center for the start of his involuntary manslaughter trial in the death of pop superstar Michael Jackson. \"Dr. Murray,\" corrected Beatrice Fakhrian, a supporter of the defendant. \"He has earned that title.\" So began the long-anticipated trial of the personal physician accused of causing the death of one of the most famous people in the world. More than 100 people from France, Spain and Australia, as well as the far-flung suburbs of Los Angeles, crowded into the dingy courthouse plaza, jockeying for a chance at one of just six courtroom seats, or to say their piece in front of television cameras. Some read psalms, some handed out sunflowers, some chanted \"Justice for Michael,\" and many of them carried signs, transforming a wall outside the courthouse into an international billboard. \"Bulgaria Loves MJ,\" one sign said. So do the Netherlands, Romania and Malaysia, according to the signed posters taped to the wall. A doctor in a while coat preached about safe ways to administer anesthesia. A Michael Jackson impersonator preened for the cameras. \"Even in death, Michael Jackson can draw a crowd,\" said Najee Ali, a Los Angeles civil rights activist who grew up in Jackson's hometown, Gary, Indiana. Ali was the force behind the \"Caravan of Love\" to support Jackson when he was acquitted in Santa Barbara of child molestation charges in 2005. Julie Jenkins, 31, came from Australia and was rewarded by winning the lottery for one of the courtroom seats available to the public. She has been a Michael Jackson fan since she was 7 and wore black jeans, a red shirt, a black armband and aviator sunglasses in honor of her idol. \"For me, it represents the first time I saw him in person,\" she said, explaining her get-up, which was vaguely reminiscent of Jackson\u00c2\u00b9s look during his \"History\" tour. \"It also represents blood, because we think he was murdered.\" She pounded a closed fist over her chest. That sentiment is shared by many of Jackson's fans, although Murray is charged with the less serious offense of involuntary manslaughter. He is accused of giving Jackson a lethal dose of the powerful anesthetic propofol to help him sleep as the pop star prepared for his comeback \"This is It\" concerts in June 2009. Defense: Michael Jackson caused his own death . Murder also is a major theme for the group \"Justice4MJ,\" which was out in force on Tuesday, leading the crowd in chants of \"Justice for Michael\" as Jackson's family walked into the courthouse. Erin Jacobs, one of the group's outspoken leaders, also won a seat for the trial's first day. She has attended every pretrial hearing, and was tossed out of court last week during jury selection after getting into a staring contest with Murray. She said she hadn't slept. Like her idol, \"I experienced insomnia last night,\" she said. \"I have been a fan my whole life. This is my passion, to work for Michael.\" Court officials warned Jacobs she would have to cover up her T-shirt in court. If she flashed her \"Justice4MJ\" logo, she'd lose her seat and be banned for the rest of the trial. Karlene Taylor, 49, wanted a seat so badly she couldn't sleep. She has been a Jackson fan since she was 8. \"I remember 'ABC' Michael,\" she said. Alas, the lottery gods did not smile on her Tuesday. Robyn Starkand and Betty Byrnes of the fan group \"Call for Love\" handed out sunflowers, hoping to lead a respectful vigil on the courthouse steps, complete with songs and prayers. But they were upstaged by a Michael Jackson look-alike. They started with \"Heal the World,\" but the voices soon waned, and Jackson impersonator Goward Horton stepped in with his version of \"Man in the Mirror,\" complete with Jackson's distinctive yips and squeaks. \"They've turned it into the Goward show,\" Starkand groused. \"This is really serious. It's not the time for a Michael Jackson impersonator.\" It was a time for the real one, their Michael.\n### Response :", "target": "Fans throng courthouse for trial of Michael Jackson's doctor .\nConrad Murray charged with manslaughter, not murder, in death of pop star .\nPeople from France, Spain and Australia vie for precious few seats inside .\nSome dress in MJ's honor, read psalms and chant \"Justice for Michael\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Both of those goals have been achieved, and the ideas continue to evolve.\" \n  \n Though the precise amount of the sale has not been revealed, Paddle8 says it makes Once Upon A Time In Shaolin the most expensive single album ever sold, topping Jack White's $300,000 purchase of a rare acetate recording of Elvis Presley's first song. \n  \n \"We pioneered a new type of intellectual property regarding the sale of a work that is simultaneously physical and digital, creating previously unexplored legal protections for a unique work that cannot be reproduced,\" added Paddle8 cofounder Alexander Gilkes. \"This marks an exciting new model of distribution for the music world and we look forward to playing an ongoing role in this innovative model.\" \n  \n As the album's producer, Tarik \"Cilvaringz\" Azzougarh, explained when FORBES first revealed the album's existence nearly two years ago: \"The essence and core of our ideas is to inspire creation and originality and debate, and save the music album from dying.\u201d \n  \n Once Upon A Time In Shaolin will remain hidden from the public ear for the foreseeable future, but Wu-Tang fans can still get a taste of the album through the 51-second snippet FORBES obtained while interviewing Azzougarh in his hometown of Marrakech, Morocco--and through the mini-documentary we produced below. \n  \n For more about the business of music, check out my Jay Z biography, Empire State of Mind, and my other book, Michael Jackson, Inc.

During the assault Friday night in the town of Hostens, south of Bordeaux, one of the students suffered a serious injury after a glass bottle was thrown in her face, French authorities said. In France to study the making of wine, the six students were at home when they were attacked by three local residents who were \"visibly in an inebriated state,\" French Interior Minister Manuel Valls said in a statement Saturday. He condemned the attack \"with great severity,\" describing it as \"xenophobic.\" Two of the suspected attackers have been questioned and taken into custody, he said. The Chinese embassy in Paris on Sunday \"strongly condemned\" the attack, calling on French authorities to \"bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure the safety of Chinese students in the country,\" the state-run Chinese news agency Xinhua reported. Users of the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo also expressed anger over the attack and concern about other Chinese students living overseas. \"Hope all students studying abroad take care of themselves and help each other,\" said somebody posting on Weibo under the username @Sunzhenming. There are more than 30,000 Chinese students in the French higher education system, more than any other overseas nationality, according to the French foreign ministry. The six who were attacked on Friday had been in France for two months and are due to study there for a year. The seriously injured student, who is about 20 years old, has been transferred to a hospital in Bordeaux for treatment, Walls said. The Chinese embassy has sent officials to Bordeaux to follow up on the situation and visit the injured students, Xinhua reported. Some Chinese social media users speculated that the high-level response to the attack by authorities in Paris and Beijing was because the students are the children of senior Chinese officials. \"They must be sons or daughters of government officials, otherwise, how come they get so much attention?\" asked @Moonyaohuihua. The local French newspaper Sud Ouest reported Sunday that the young woman with the face injury is the daughter of a Chinese \"dignitary.\" The Chinese foreign ministry didn't immediately respond to a request Monday about her identity. French media and Xinhua reported that the three local men had attacked the Chinese students because they believed the students had called police earlier in the evening to complain about noise they were making.

{"source": "### Instruction :I need a summary of the review.Washington (CNN) -- Attention, all drug runners. Your days of using caltrops to avoid apprehension are over -- at least in Texas. Caltrops -- more commonly known as road spikes -- are small spiky objects like those used in the game of jacks. When tossed on roadways, they always point up and have a devastating impact on tires. Drug runners have increasingly used the devices when fleeing from law enforcement officers, officials say. Beginning Thursday, caltrops are illegal in the Lone Star State. State Rep. Aaron Pena crafted the caltrop ban at the behest of the U.S. Border Patrol, whose tires have borne the caltrops' trademark slashes. \"There's a portion of my district which goes right up to the border, the (Rio Grande) river,\" Pena said. \"And caltrops are used there probably more than any other location in the United States.\" Almost all reported cases of caltrop use can be found in a 20-mile stretch of the border west of McAllen, Texas, authorities said. \"The first time we were exposed to this was 2008 when we had one incident,\" said Rosendo Hinojosa, chief of the Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley Sector. In 2009, there were 12 incidents, with 13 last year. The homemade caltrops found in Pena's district probably are made in Mexico. Typically, they are little nails that are welded together. They are cheap, easy to deploy and, Pena says, very effective. \"If you run over a caltrop, your tires will deflate,\" he said. Caltrops also are indiscriminate. Those that do not puncture the tires of pursuing police cars sometimes puncture the tires of citizens' cars. No one spoke in opposition to the ban at a hearing, Pena said. Hinojosa said while caltrops are effective, the Border Patrol has a countermeasure. \"They can't spike our helicopters,\" he said. But caltrops are hardly a new idea. There are numerous references throughout history to caltrops being used to puncture the feet of enemy soldiers or the hooves of their horses. The notorious bank robber John Dillinger, employing a similar tactic, is alleged to have tossed nails behind his car to defeat pursuing police officers following a heist. The Dillinger gang \"actually did it several times. It became part of their robbery technique,\" said Tony Stewart, author of \"Dillinger: The Hidden Truth - Re-loaded.\" The new Texas law prohibits the possession, manufacture, transportation, repair or sale of caltrops. But it exempts tire puncture strips that are designed to puncture tires when driven in a specific direction, such as those at car rental facilities, and caltrops used as curios, such as those in museums, or on display in Pena's office. Will the ban stop drug runners from using caltrops? \"No,\" Pena conceded. \"No, it won't. But it is a small measure that taken with other small measures will add up to an effective response.\"\n### Response :", "target": "U.S. Border Patrol requested the new law .\nSimple devices known to be highly effective .\nLegislator who introduced measure admits it won't stop drug runners .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given review.(CNN) -- Nineteen months after she and 18 others were shot at a political event -- six of them fatally -- former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords returned home Sunday to her native southern Arizona, her husband said. Giffords has spent most of the time since the January 8, 2011, attack at medical facilities in Houston recovering from being shot in the head at a \"Congress On Your Corner\" event outside a Safeway supermarket in Tucson. She has returned to her hometown several times since that shooting, though not permanently until now. \"Moving back to Tucson today,\" her husband Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain and astronaut, wrote Sunday on his Twitter feed. \"Gabby has been waiting for this day for a long time.\" Records from the Pima County Assessor's Office posted online indicate that Kelly and Giffords bought a 10-room, single family residence in June in central Tucson. The couple paid $1.495 million in cash for the property, which sold for half that price in November 2007, the records show. Then in her third term, Giffords stepped down from her position in Congress in January 2012 to focus on her recovery. Ron Barber, a Giffords aide also wounded in the attack, now holds the seat. On Tuesday, Jared Lee Loughner pleaded guilty to 19 charges related to the incident. That included admitting to killing federal employees U.S. District Court Chief Judge John M. Roll and congressional aide Gabriel M. Zimmerman, as well as Dorothy Morris, Phyllis Schneck, Dorwan Stoddard and 9-year-old Christina Taylor Green. Federal prosecutors said that, under the plea deal, Loughner will be sentenced to life in prison with no eligibility for parole -- meaning he will not get the death penalty, as might have happened with a conviction. His sentencing is set for November 15, prosecutors said. The 23-year-old, whose legal proceedings had been complicated by questions about his mental health, waived his right to seek an insanity defense as part of his plea agreement.

{"source": "### Instruction:Read the paragraph below, then write a summary of it. (CNN) -- Voldemort did not die in vain. Ralph Fiennes may have dedicated a good part of the last decade to torturing Harry Potter, but he's also found the time, the energy and the clout to pull off his first film as director. By any standards, \"Coriolanus\" is an ambitious undertaking, a modern-day interpretation of one of Shakespeare's meatiest but less frequently performed plays. Although not everything comes off, Fiennes' bold, dynamic movie will make you glad he took up the challenge. Set in \"Some place calling itself Rome,\" but filmed, very tellingly, in battle-scarred Serbia and Montenegro, \"Coriolanus\" imagines a modern state rocked by food shortages and border disputes. Gen. Caius Martius (Fiennes) returns triumphant from vanquishing archenemy Tullus Aufidius (Gerard Butler) and the Volsces from their stronghold, Corioles, and takes on the name of this, his most famous victory. But an attempt to make him consul, or head of state, alarms some senators who know his contempt for ordinary civilians. While he easily carries the Senate, tradition demands that Caius, now known as \"Coriolanus,\" must also seek the assent of the citizenry in the public market. Too proud to court public opinion, he goes through the motions, but when his enemies turn the crowd against him, his fury only makes matters worse and the general is banished from Rome. Alone and angry, he swears vengeance and offers his services to Aufidius. As in other modern-dress Shakespearean adaptations, there are anomalies and eccentricities in this production, which brandishes guns and tanks but talks of swords and ultimately falls back on knife fights. The notion of the warrior-hero who can carry battles single-handedly doesn't really jibe with modern warfare, and it's been a while since we had a military man as president. Shakespeare's play leaves no doubt that however we value heroism on the battlefield, it's no qualification for success in politics. Coriolanus is undone by his own peculiar integrity, a refusal to exploit his war record for votes; but only because he finds the democratic process demeaning -- he's a pure elitist, the kind of person who believes that birthright is destiny. In power, he'd be a disaster. Not that the scheming, cynical professional politicians come out much better in this telling, or the fickle and easily manipulated populace for that matter. Politics is a dirty business, but Coriolanus betrays everyone he's ever known to uphold his own warped sense of honor. Head shaved, scarred, and often caked in blood, Fiennes is utterly compelling, a kind of Roman Rambo. We know he can play villains, but even if he's essentially a fascist, there is something noble about Coriolanus, and tragic, too, in his inability to bend or compromise. He is his own man, though we see very well that he's entirely the creation of his ferocious mother, Volumnia (a magnificent Vanessa Redgrave), and ultimately powerless before her. Substantially streamlined by screenwriter and playwright John Logan (whose scripts for \"Rango\" and \"Hugo\" also made it to the screen last year), Shakespeare's verse sounds a bit strange in the voice of cable TV newscasters, but the device works very well to convey background information and keep the action flowing. Logan has cut the play in half, but what it loses in detail the movie more than picks up in clarity and punch. Budget constraints probably account for Rome's surprisingly meager population and a Volsci army that seems to number about two dozen, but you can't argue with the talent in the foreground: Brian Cox, Jessica Chastain and Gerard Butler don't misplace a single syllable between them. This is Shakespearean acting of the highest caliber, and a powerful, bloody vision of \"honor\" gone mad.\n### Response: ", "target": "By any standards, \"Coriolanus\" is an ambitious undertaking .\nRalph Fiennes' bold, dynamic movie will make you glad he took up the challenge .\nFiennes is utterly compelling, a kind of Roman Rambo .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What are the central ideas presented?(CNN) -- Her passion for public speaking and networking have earned Julia Hobsbawm the moniker \"queen of networking\" and made her one of the most influential people in the UK. As the founder of knowledge networking business Editorial Intelligence she aims to create more face-to-face meetings and live debates in a digital age where many opinion-formers are far too isolated in their corporate silos. To that end, Hobsbawm founded the Names Not Numbers ideas festival in 2009 to connect people from \"different walks of life -- business, culture, media, politics, academia, with each other in a very intensive setting.\" CNN's Route to the Top caught up with Hobsbawm to talk about the brainstorming retreat she's created, the rising popularity of ideas conferences and the importance of intellectual stimulation. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN: What is Names Not Numbers? Julia Hobsbawm: It's a mini-festival about ideas -- that's the best way I can describe it. Each year, 150 to 200 participants from diverse backgrounds such as business, politics, law, or arts set off on a three days long journey to talk about the things that really matter. What makes it attractive to people is that in this environment where everything is busy and rushed, actually slowing down is a counter-intuitively refreshing and rewarding thing to do. CNN: Is your conference aimed at connecting mind, body and soul? JH: It seems that something happens physically and chemically when you go for a journey. When people relax, they give more of themselves. Rather than just dropping out of the office for an hour and then rushing back, you are with a small family of people for a period of time. All sorts of ideas begin to exchange really fruitfully, friendships and business developments form. What people really want is to be looked after, as if they were going to a sort of \"ideas holiday.\" CNN: Why do you think that events like this proved so popular over the past decade? JH: The \"ideas conference\" is still relatively young -- the TED conferences celebrate their 30th anniversary this year; Names Not Numbers is seven years old. I think it is no accident that we see more public and private festivals in the decade that'd seen Facebook. So, as a knowledge networking company, we explore how people crave a face-to-face connection in a Facebook age. Whilst technology enables everybody to connect, what actually moves the dial on relationships and connections is that when you speak to someone, you look in their face, you take a read of their body language. I think this is why the intensity and the immediacy of an elongated conference work so well. CNN: Names Not numbers has been described as an \"intellectual Viagra.\" What does that mean to you? JH: In a working world, we sometimes forget that people like to be intellectually stimulated. Many don't often get the opportunity in their day jobs to use all the bits of their brain and their emotions. We hope we allow that to come out a bit. CNN: Do you think that idea conferences may pose a risk of over-stimulation in today's information age? JH: I think the age of overload is a real risk for people. And one of the benefits of coming away for two or three days of content that other people put together for you is that it actually allows you to relax. You don't have to fervently read and go online, screen a million emails and worry about what you've missed. So, in a curious way, actually having a very rich, immersive period of time is reassuring -- the programming has been done for you. READ THIS: Career tips from leading bosses .

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?A former aide and a former mistress of one-time presidential candidate John Edwards have settled a civil lawsuit between them that, among other measures, mandates the imminent destruction of sex tapes featuring Edwards and the woman. Orange County, North Carolina, Superior Court Judge Carl Fox on Thursday signed the settlement agreement between Andrew Young, his wife and Rielle Hunter, the woman who had sued the couple, according to court official Tammy Keshler. Hunter had sued Young and his wife, Cheri, for invasion of privacy seeking to reclaim materials that she said belong to her, including personal photographs and an alleged sex tape showing her with Edwards. While the settlement addresses the transfer and destruction of videos, photographs and other documents, no monetary damages were awarded and the Youngs admit no liability. The court clerk will destroy the sex tape, while the Youngs must make a good-faith effort to ensure that the copy of the video that they gave to the U.S. government is likewise destroyed, per the agreement. The former aide and his wife will get back family videos and photos, though they cannot use any that include Hunter or her daughter -- whom Edwards has admitted he fathered -- for anything besides family purposes. Edwards' fall: From golden boy to tabloid tale . Young wrote a book, \"The Politician: An Insider's Account of John Edwards's Pursuit of the Presidency and the Scandal That Brought Him Down,\" in which he describes an elaborate plan to use money from two wealthy benefactors to allow Edwards to maintain a relationship with Hunter. She worked as a videographer on the failed 2008 presidential campaign of the former North Carolina senator, who was also the Democrats' 2004 vice presidential nominee with running mate John Kerry. Plans are under way to make that book, \"The Politician,\" into a movie from Aaron Sorkin and Colvin Road Entertainment. The Youngs can use information already in the book, in court proceedings or otherwise in the public domain. But anything beyond that is prohibited by court order, and the couple cannot publicize the planned film. A gag order prohibits either of the parties from discussing the settlement. The agreement does not resolve the pending criminal contempt proceedings against Young and his wife. Young's former boss, Edwards, is scheduled to be on trial himself after being indicted last year on charges including conspiracy, issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws regarding donations to and payments from his presidential campaign. Edwards' pending criminal trial . Edwards denies any wrongdoing. Whether the money given to support Hunter by Edwards' benefactors -- as alleged by Young in his book -- should have been considered campaign donations is a key issue in Edwards' upcoming trial.

If convicted on all counts, Edwards could face 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1.5 million.\n### Response : ", "target": "John Edwards' ex-mistress had sued his former aide for invasion of privacy .\nA settlement between them was reached and signed Thursday by a N.C. judge .\nCopies of a sex tape showing the ex-mistress and Edwards will be destroyed .\nThe aide and his wife admit no liability, and there is no monetary settlement .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction :How would you distill the main concepts?(CNN) -- A large group of Baltimore corrections officers and members of a notorious prison gang have been working together to peddle drugs, phones and sex inside the city's jail, prosecutors say. But an indictment released this week is another shot, prosecutors say, in putting an end to it. An indictment, announcing charges on 14 more Baltimore corrections officers, reads like script from the now defunct HBO crime drama \"The Wire.\" But the U.S. Attorney's Office for Maryland says this drama involving prison gang , the Black Guerrilla Family, and a growing number of Baltimore jail guards has gone on for too long. \"Correctional officers were in bed with BGF inmates,\" said U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein. Rosenstein seemed to mean that literally and figuratively, court documents show. According to one indictment, alleged gang member Tavon White had a sexual relationship with four jail guards while he was incarcerated. He impregnated all four of them and they all helped him smuggle items in prison, according to the indictment. One of the guards had \"Tavon\" tattooed on her wrist, the indictment said. In January, White summed up his standing in the prison while talking on a cell phone that had been smuggled in, the indictment says . \"This is my jail. You understand that? I'm dead serious ... I make every final call in this jail ... and nothing go past me ... Any of my brothers that deal with anybody, it's gonna come to me. Before (somebody) stab somebody, they gotta run it through me,\" White said according to the indictment. Correctional officers were allegedly \"bribed\" to smuggle in drugs, cell phones and other prohibited objects, which they hid underneath their clothes, \"inside body cavities,\" even in sandwiches. New Orleans jail video shows drugs, guns, filth . Some inmates who weren't part of the gang had to pay protection money -- or more accurately, their relatives on the outside did -- authorities claim. \"Court documents allege the BGF members recruited correctional officers through personal and often sexual relationships, as well as bribes, and that some officers traded sex for money,\" the U.S. Attorney's office said in its news release. The end result was what Rosenstein's office called a \"criminal organization\" operating inside jails \"enabling (participants) to make large amounts of money through drug trafficking, robbery, assault, extortion, bribery, witness retaliation, money laundering and obstruction of justice.\" The investigation first came to light in April with the announcement of the first round of arrests.

{"source": "### Instruction:Produce an article summary of the following news article:Doc to summarize:\n### Input :Washington (CNN) -- No blood was spilled. But otherwise, a packed Senate hearing room Tuesday watched the political equivalent of a heavyweight fight. Top Senate Democrat Harry Reid sat just feet from rival Republican Leader Mitch McConnell for a rhetorical battle royal over campaign finance and Reid's push to change the Constitution to limit that spending. \"The Constitution doesn't give corporations a vote, and it doesn't give dollar bills a vote,\" said Reid. The Nevada Democrat is pushing for a Constitutional amendment to override the Supreme Court's 2010 \"Citizens United\" decision and allow Congress to set firm limits on independent and corporate campaign spending in federal elections. The proposal, sponsored by Democratic Sens. Tom Udall of New Mexico and Michael Bennet of Colorado, would also allow states to set more campaign limits in their elections. The Judiciary Committee hearing set up a rare side-by-side appearance by Reid and McConnell, two powerful leaders who are known for their sometimes bitter disagreements over process and policy in the Senate. The effect was electric as the hearing started. Hundreds of seated spectators craned their necks to see both men. As McConnell looked straight ahead at the panel of senators, Reid swung. \"Campaign finance reform has been proposed a number of times before -- even by my counterpart, Senator McConnell,\" Reid said. The Democratic leader pointed to the Republican's 1988 proposal that would have restricted some PAC and so-called \"soft-money\" contributions made to organizations. McConnell's office has said that the proposal was an alternative to a much more limiting campaign finance bill and insists he has not voted for any funding restrictions since. But Reid kept at it. \"Senator McConnell had the right idea (in 1988),\" he offered. The Nevada senator also employed his signature move in the debate, blasting conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, saying the brothers run 15 \"phantom\" or \"phony\" campaign funding organizations. Who are the Koch brothers? McConnell waited his turn. Reid finished but then surprised some in the room, indicating he would not stay to hear McConnell's response. Reid's office later told CNN that he had to give remarks at a meeting about mental health and suicide prevention. As he moved to leave, Reid joked that his Republican counterpart likely would not be upset by his departure. \"Nope, no problem,\" McConnell deadpanned. To scattered laughter, Reid exited. Then, the Republican punched back. \"Given how incredibly bad this amendment is, I can't blame my friend, the majority leader, from wanting to talk about the Koch Brothers or what I may have said over a quarter century ago,\" McConnell said. The Kentucky Republican jabbed at the proposal to give Congress control of campaign limits. He called it a threat to basic speech rights and then got to the basic disagreement of the debate: Whether limiting campaign dollars is also limiting speech. Supreme Court allows more private money in election campaigns . By setting spending rates, McConnell argued, Congress would choose who gets how much influence in politics. \"Not only would (this proposal) allow the government to favor some speakers over others, it would guarantee preferential treatment,\" McConnell argued. Other senators in the hearing soon rang in, exchanging quotes from the founding fathers and debating which political party was truly protecting free speech. \"This amendment is about power and it is about silencing citizens,\" boomed Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican of Texas. \"When did the (Democrats) abandon the Bill of Rights? ... This would give Congress the power to ban books and muzzle movies.\" Members of the group Public Citizen, which opposes the \"Citizens United\" ruling that removed legal barriers preventing corporations and unions from spending unlimited sums on federal elections, laughed mockingly as Cruz spoke. A few rows ahead, some others shot them stern looks. 2014 Midterms: What's at stake . Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer responded directly to Cruz' strike at Democrats. \"I think if Thomas Jefferson were looking down at what's being proposed here, he would agree with it,\" Schumer said. The New Yorker noted that the Supreme Court has upheld some limits on speech, including restrictions on things like child pornography. He directly challenged the Texas tea party favorite. \"I want to ask you Sen. Cruz - are you against anti-child pornography laws?\" Schumer asked. At the time, Cruz was gone, voting on the Senate floor. When he returned, he was not pleased. \"I understand that in my absence Sen. Schumer very kindly gave a lecture on civility and encouraged me not to go over the top, while he then in the same breath accused me of supporting child pornography,\" Cruz told the committee sarcastically. \"So I appreciate that demonstration in senatorial restraint from the senior senator from New York.\" The hearing was both a serious, powerful debate and an exercise in the tricky personal and political barbs that now litter the Senate. Attendance alone indicated the high stakes and interest in the topic -- with a long hallway full of people being sent to an overflow room to watch the hearing from the building next door. The subject has keen advantages to both political sides, both use it to stoke their bases. But while the hearing may have been high-interest, McConnell ultimately raised the bottom-line question: Where will this constitutional amendment push end up? \"Everybody on this committee knows this proposal is never going to pass Congress. This is a political exercise and that's all this is,\" McConnell told the committee. Democrats insist they will fight for the change, but there is no vote scheduled yet on the proposal and it is not clear when there could be one.

{"source": "### Instruction:Could you highlight the primary messages?Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The fate of Iraq's newly revised election law again hinges on the approval of the country's Sunni Arab vice president, who is under pressure to sign the much-contested plan. The new bill has been approved by the other two members of the presidency council. Adel Abdul Mahdi, the country's Shiite vice president, issued a statement Thursday saying he and President Jalal Talabani, who is Kurdish, have put their signatures on it. But Tariq al-Hashimi, the country's Sunni Arab vice president, who vetoed the original election bill last week, continues to threaten to veto this revised measure, and Mahdi and Talabani are trying to persuade him to sign the document. Al-Hashimi's vote is key because in Iraq, legislation passed by the parliament must be ratified unanimously by the presidency council, made up of the country's two vice presidents and the president. \"All the efforts are devoted to have the entire presidency council approval on the the law, coming from the joint concern about elections to take place in the specified date,\" Mahdi said in a statement. But al-Hashimi said Wednesday that the \"veto is still an option and it will be used if I find that the current law doesn't conform to the [Iraqi] justice and the constitution.\" The upcoming parliamentary elections and a law setting down rules for elections are seen as important barometers of Iraqi progress toward stability. The election is also key step in plans for a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq, About 115,000 American troops remain in Iraq, and the Obama administration plans to pull all but 30,000 to 50,000 of them out of the country by August. Al-Hashimi vetoed the Iraqi parliament's first election law last week, arguing it failed to provide enough seats for Iraqi refugees, many of whom are Sunnis. A revised bill passed by Iraq's parliament on Monday remains \"unconstitutional and unfair,\" al-Hashimi said in a statement issued by his office. The previous law \"was more fair to Iraqis than the new law, which Mr. al-Hashimi will deal with just like he dealt with the previous one,\" the statement said. Iraq's constitution calls for elections by January 31. Disputes over how seats will be allocated in a new parliament have put the vote in jeopardy. Lawmakers need a two-thirds majority to override a veto, but Iraq's parliament adjourned until December 8 after passing Monday's revised bill. Iraq's top electoral commission -- saying it needs 60 days to prepare for voting -- announced last week that a January vote is unlikely. Al-Hashimi said the election bill is unfair to Iraqis who were forced to flee violence in their homeland, and he refused to sign it without an amendment that would increase the number of seats allocated to refugees and small political parties that could not get enough votes on a national level. In addition to al-Hashimi's objections, Kurdish leaders had threatened to boycott the upcoming vote unless provinces with heavy Kurdish populations get greater representation in the next parliament. The law that parliament passed Monday included revisions the Kurds had sought, but not those al-Hashimi demanded. Al-Hashimi's office said the new law was passed without \"national accordance\" and outside parliament's usual way to deal with \"sensitive national legislation of this caliber.\" \"What happened constitutes a dangerous precedent that will negatively overshadow the overall political process,\" the statement said. Asked whether the political holdups in passing a law will mean a delay in the election and troop withdrawals, U.S. Gen. Ray Odierno told CNN Thursday that the withdrawal schedule is not as important as getting a law. \"Their democratic process is working, and I think it's important that they have a law that everyone will accept so we can move forward together -- that's the most important thing. I believe we have enough flexibility we'll be able to mitigate it and we'll be able to go on and have successful elections,\" said Odierno, the top U.S. commander in Iraq.\n### Response :", "target": "Laws passed by Iraqi parliament must be approved by president and two vice presidents .\nOne VP, Sunni Tariq al-Hashimi, holding off on signing new election law .\nAl-Hashimi vetoed previous version of bill last week, saying it left out Iraqi refugees .\nIraq's president and other VP trying to persuade al-Hashimi to sign the bill .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Aviation authorities said weather conditions were clear. The plane came down one mile from the coast near fishermen, who tried to help those on board, Air Moorea said in a statement. It gave no further details. Moorea is one of around 118 islands scattered across an area the size of Europe in the South Pacific that make up France's overseas territory of French Polynesia. Authorities in Papeete said the victims included two tourists and two European officials posted to the region, who local media said had been visiting a water purification plant.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?(CNN) -- Red Cross President and CEO Mark W. Everson has stepped down after revelations he was \"engaged in a personal relationship with a subordinate employee,\" the organization announced Tuesday. Mark W. Everson says he is leaving his post, effective immediately, for \"personal and family reasons.\" The Red Cross Board of Governors asked for and received Everson's  resignation after it \"concluded that the situation reflected poor judgment on Mr. Everson's part and diminished his ability to lead the organization in the future,\"  the Red Cross said in a statement on its Web site. Everson, 53, said in a written statement that he was leaving the $500,000-per-year job \"for personal and family reasons, and deeply regret it is impossible for me to continue in a job so recently undertaken.\" Everson -- who is married and has two children -- joined the Red Cross as president and CEO last May. The organization became aware of Everson's relationship with a female Red Cross employee 10 days ago, Chief Public Affairs Officer Suzy C. DeFrancis told CNN in a telephone interview. \"I think the board acted very quickly,\" she said, adding that the woman remains in her job. About Everson, DeFrancis said, \"We're grateful for his service.\" The board of governors on Tuesday appointed Mary S. Elcano, general counsel and five-year Red Cross employee, as interim president and CEO. Everson had worked in the Bush administration from August 2001 -- including serving as commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service -- until he was hired by the Red Cross. \"This is flabbergasting, that's all I can say. It's completely contrary to his public persona that he evidenced while he was at the IRS,\" said Suzanne Ross McDowell, a Washington-based attorney who served on an advisory committee to the IRS division that deals with tax-exempt organizations. \"From the standpoint of exempt organizations on the non-profit sector, it's just another news story that we would rather not see,\" she said. \"It's got nothing to do with the Red Cross,\" said Ira Milstein, a New York lawyer specializing in corporate governance who has worked with the organization and was impressed with Everson. \"He was a team player and a good leader. To have him fall off a cliff like this is just sad.\" A search committee has been formed to begin the process of finding Everson's permanent replacement, the organization said. The job has been a challenging one. Marsha J. Evans resigned as president in 2005, after the Red Cross response to Hurricane Katrina came under fire. Four years earlier, Bernadine Healy quit the post after the organization was criticized for mishandling donations intended for victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks and collecting vast quantities of blood that was not needed and ultimately thrown out. Healy told reporters she \"had no choice\" about her resignation. Meanwhile, DeFrancis acknowledged Tuesday that, 14 years after a court ordered the agency to improve its collection of blood, it has yet to meet federal safety and quality-control requirements.

The quake was originally reported as having a magnitude of 4.3, but the USGS later downgraded it to magnitude 3.8. It hit just before 4 a.m. CT (5 a.m. ET), with an epicenter about 3 miles underground. The USGS pinpointed the quake between the towns of Virgil and Sycamore, Illinois. Millions of people felt the temblor, with reports coming in to the USGS from Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Iowa and Wisconsin, as well as Illinois. Members of the public sent more than 10,000 reports of the earthquake to the USGS within the first few hours after it struck. See local coverage of the Illinois earthquake . Several callers to CNN said the quake shook their homes severely, but there were no immediate reports of major damage. Doug Dupont of Belvidere, Illinois, about 70 miles northwest of downtown Chicago, said the quake shook him out of bed and caused a 1-foot-long crack in the wall of his kitchen. \"It was really scary. It felt like a train was going by our house,\" Dupont said. \"This is not California. This is northern Illinois. We are not supposed to get earthquakes.\" Did you feel it? Tell the world about it . Rex Covington, who lives about five miles west of Elgin, Illinois, told CNN affiliate WGN that the tremor lasted five or six seconds -- and also shook him out of bed. \"I was sleeping and the whole bed was shaking, it was that violent,\" Covington said. \"The whole house shook,\" Walter Mockus of St. Charles, Illinois, told WGN. \"The chimes that hang were all ringing. It was so loud, I thought a plane had gone down.\" The shaking also woke up Sarah Evans, of Elgin, Illinois. She immediately turned to the microblogging site Twitter, where she has 38,000 \"followers,\" to see if anyone else had felt the quake. Evans instantly found others in her area who had experienced the shaking, and says she found them comforting because \"I'd never felt an earthquake before.\" Read about how Evans confirmed the earthquake and connected with others on Twitter . The Illinois earthquake was mild compared to the one that leveled parts of Haiti last month, according to the USGS. The Haiti quake was about 33,000 times as powerful. Some of the strongest earthquakes ever known to hit the United States took place in the Mississippi River valley in 1811, 1812, and 1895, but Wednesday's Illinois event was 250 miles or more to the north of those temblors, said Randy Baldwin, a geophysicist with the USGS. \"This is a different area geologically,\" he said, calling Wednesday's earthquake unrelated to the New Madrid quakes of the 19th century.

{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.\n### Input :(CNN) -- When Jackie Stewart speaks about driver safety in Formula One, it's worth listening. The racing legend was a pioneer in raising standards in an era when mortality rates were high, and his legacy has left F1 stars with greater support than ever before. But he is still worried about one burning issue -- the controversy over sole supplier Pirelli's tires, which he says are dangerous due to their rapid rate of degradation. The three-time world champion told CNN that drivers risked a \"multiple-car accident\" unless immediate improvements are made. \"I don't think that amount of rubber should be coming off the tires and be left to the side of the track,\" the 72-year-old said. \"If you go over that rubber it then sticks to the terribly hot -- above 100C (212F) -- tires. \"When you get to the next corner your car is now totally unstable, and when you're going to brake you'll probably lose control of your car. If there's a car close to you then that will cause a multiple-car accident -- it has to be improved.\" The Scotsman, who notched up 27 wins in an F1 career spanning eight years, also blamed the tires for the exceptionally open season. Four different drivers have won each of the four races so far, ahead of the start of the European swing in Spain this weekend. \"An issue that nobody can quite work out is how the tire wheel, tire temperatures work,\" Stewart said. \"We've seen a lot of winning and losing because of when people have chosen or not chosen to go into the pits.\" The \"Flying Scot\" -- as he was nicknamed during his racing days -- agreed with Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher's criticisms of the Italian tire manufacturer. Seven-time world champion Schumacher has complained about the quicker degradation of the tires and even likened them to driving on \"on raw eggs.\" McLaren team boss Martin Whitmarsh, whose drivers Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button struggled with their tires at the Bahrain Grand Prix, has also criticized Pirelli. Meanwhile Schumacher's teammate Nico Rosberg, who won the China Grand Prix last month, argued the unpredictability made racing interesting. Pirelli has argued it should be congratulated for such an open, unpredictable season. The manufacturer claimed it was simply responding to calls for more eventful racing, with director Paul Hembery saying: \"We are pushing the limits.\" Stewart, who won the Spanish Grand Prix three times, said the high caliber of this season's drivers made it anyone's championship. \"They're probably the best bunch of drivers I've seen since the late '60s, early '70s when we had around eight or nine drivers capable of winning.\" He said Nico Rosberg's win in China could finally spell a comeback for Mercedes. It was the German marque's first race win since Juan Manuel Fangio in Italy in 1955. This week the team played down reports it could be set to quit F1. British newspaper The Times claimed UK-based Mercedes could be forced out over a power dispute arising from F1's proposed stock exchange flotation. A Mercedes spokesman said only that they were \"in discussions with the commercial rights holder.\" But Stewart believes this could be Mercedes' season, saying they were \"giants.\" \"The Silver Arrow has been winning races since the '20s and '30s and came back in the '50s and won races,\" he said. \"If they hadn't won that race (in China) and showed themselves to be that competitive in the ones immediately following it, I think there might have been a chance of Mercedes Benz withdrawing from Formula One.\"\n### Response :", "target": "Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart says Pirelli's F1 tires are dangerous .\n\"Flying Scot\" says drivers risk a multiple-car accident unless improvements are made .\nSafety pioneer claims that rubber residue on race tracks will cause problems .\nThe 72-year-old says the 2012 F1 lineup is the best crop of drivers in decades .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the main idea?(CNN) -- First, Brandeis University offered an honorary degree to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an outspoken critic of Islam. Then apparently when officials actually familiarized themselves with her writing after several complaints, they took the offer back this week. One Fox News contributor calls it \"an honor killing, Brandeis-style.\" That's crass, but the university's behavior is certainly disappointing. It smacks of cowardice, and Hirsi Ali can't be blamed for seeing it as an attack on her personal dignity. An act that was meant to honor her has been turned into an opportunity to shame her -- and, as she pointed out, \"The slur on my reputation is not the worst aspect of this episode. More deplorable is that an institution set up on the basis of religious freedom should today so deeply betray its own founding principles.\" Indeed, the fear of creating offense is not compatible with academic freedom. On the contrary, criticizing society in the boldest terms possible is what intellectuals are there to do. So Brandeis ought to have stood by its invitation. But there are some who would ask why it made the invitation in the first place. If the institution was worried about generating controversy, all it had to do was Google her name to discover that Hirsi Ali is a very controversial person. Indeed, her views fall well outside of the mainstream. Hirsi Ali's story is undeniably moving. Born in Somalia, she was the victim of female genital mutilation at the age of 5 and was betrothed into an arranged marriage, which she escaped by seeking political asylum in the Netherlands. Thereafter she emerged as a forceful, politically engaged critic of Islam -- her memoir, \"Infidel,\" is an extraordinary testament to the horrors that fundamentalism can wrought on an individual. Her ethnicity excuses her from the charge of racism; her politics is not reactionary but rather a very muscular variety of liberal universalism. However, the Islam that Hirsi Ali knew and denounces is a narrow cultural experience -- not the reality of the religion as a whole. There is no female genital mutilation in the Koran; tribes do it because it is a custom, not a legitimate religious instruction. Likewise, the extreme Islamism that threatens the West -- and against which the right campaigns -- is a small, geographically limited phenomenon that is almost unrelated to the considerably more liberal forms of Islam practiced in, say, Bangladesh or Europe. It is true that Taliban Afghanistan or Iran have been theocratic, but this doesn't make Islam incompatible with democracy. Far from it: Muslim political protest has been the heart and soul of the Arab Spring. And Hirsi Ali's insistence that \"violence is inherent in Islam\" is absurd. Violence is inherent in all of humanity -- you only have to read the Judeo-Christian Old Testament to find that out. And if violence was a purely Muslim thing, wouldn't we expect Muslims universally to hold fascistic views? On the contrary, evidence suggests that globally they lean toward democracy, pluralism and a qualified gender equality. Moreover, Hirsi Ali's personal experience of life growing up in war-torn Africa is a million miles away from that lived among second- or third-generation Muslim immigrants in Europe. There the picture is one of integration, spoiled only by a handful of radicals who were tolerated by both the state and the Islamic community for far too long. British journalist Fraser Nelson recently wrote a widely read piece pointing out that newspaper headlines about Islamic fundamentalism give a distorted view of religious relations in the United Kingdom. He noted, \"Last year ... the Jews of Bradford were facing the closure of their synagogue. Its roof was leaking, and the few dozen remaining regulars could not afford the repairs ... As things turned out, the synagogue was saved after a fundraising campaign led by a local mosque. Zulfi Karim, the secretary of Bradford's Council of Mosques, now refers to (synagogue chairman Rudi) Leavor -- who fled the Nazis -- as his 'newfound brother.' \" When I wrote a piece in the same newspaper arguing that Islam was very close to Britishness in its obsession with good manners, hospitality and charity, I received dozens of abusive missives from white supremacists. It was a reminder that the flipside of Islamism is anti-Muslim hate. Which, I'm afraid to say, is given propaganda material by the well-dressed, middle-class intellectuals who appear so frequently on our televisions to pronounce that \"violence is inherent in Islam.\" All of which doesn't mean that Hirsi Ali should be driven from the public sphere. On the contrary, her story is a testament to the evil that does exist in the world, and Brandeis should have stood by its decision to honor her. The right to speak freely should never be tampered with. But in the conversation about the limits to this speech that has followed, let this one fact be remembered: Hirsi Ali's views are deemed politically incorrect for good reason.\n### Response:", "target": "Timothy Stanley: Brandeis withdrew honorary degree offer to Islam critic Ayaan Hirsi Ali .\nHe says move runs counter to academic freedom, Brandeis shouldn't have withdrawn it .\nHad university vetted her, it would have seen her views on Islam are narrow, he says .\nStanley: Hirsi Ali's views are deemed politically incorrect for good reason .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction :What are the central ideas presented?In the last week, the Apple iWatch has made the jump from unlikely rumor to a real product that's probably in development, thanks to well-placed leaks that have been showing up in various publications. The latest is a report from Bloomberg that says Apple already has a team of 100 employees working on a wearable device. The clues, and resulting flurry of speculation, are planting the seeds of an Apple watch in consumers' minds. The general public has not been crying out for a better watch. Apple dream-product rumors have mostly focused on an elusive Apple TV over the past year. But Apple prides itself on knowing what the people want before they do, and an Apple watch would be way more than just a fancy timepiece. It's not about the watch form factor, but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors, better battery life and improved voice recognition. An Apple watch could work with an ecosystem of third-party wearable sensors and products that tie into one powerful, small hub. If executed correctly, an Apple watch could spawn a lucrative industry of compatible products, like it did with the iOS App Store and mobile applications. \"It's unlimited, the number of wearable things you can tap into,\" said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that alert the watch when you've eaten too much. Apple is not entering virgin territory. There are already a handful of slick smart watches available, but most act as accessories, connecting to the more powerful Android and iOS smartphones and tablets over Bluetooth. For example, the new Pebble smart watch passes on alerts from a smartphone, so when you receive a text, e-mail, or Facebook notification it is pushed to the watch, which vibrates. Wearable technology is also booming, thanks to cheap sensors that can be used to track things like movement and heart rates. The number of wearable fitness products has been growing at a fast pace, but an Apple offering would shake up the industry completely. \"We're finally getting some players involved, and Apple's the real one, that can add some value to some of this wearable technology,\" said Munster. Apple isn't alone in seeing the potential for this type of technology. Google is working on its own wearable platform, Google Glasses. The two will face off when they are finally available, each sporting its own unique take on what kind of user interface people will use (voice control and a small touchscreen or augmented reality). And they will, of course, have their own ecosystems of accessories and apps. Traditional watches have dropped in popularity in recent years. Smartphones prominently display the time and are already in our back pockets, so it can seem redundant to also strap a small clock to our wrists. But when you start packing more power, sensors and connection options like Bluetooth into a watch, it ceases to be a watch and becomes a small wearable computer. An Apple watch could leap frog the current crop of smart watches by creating a platform, not another accessory. According to Munster, the three tasks people use their smartphones for are, in order, texting, Internet and phone calls. Two out of three of those tasks would be a natural fit for a small device, while the need to surf and play games would ensure the smartphone doesn't become obsolete.\n### Response : ", "target": "An Apple watch could pass existing smart watches with more computing, sensor power .\nBloomberg reports that 100 employees are already working on developing the device .\nA watch could spawn an industry of compatible third-party wearable accessories .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

With first lady Michelle Obama at his side, the president told the cheering crowd filling the East Room that his administration would work to repeal the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and end the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy regarding gays in the military. \"I know that many in this room don't believe that progress has come fast enough, and I understand that,\" Obama said. \"It's not for me to tell you to be patient any more than it was for others to counsel patience to African-Americans who were petitioning for equal rights a half-century ago.\" The \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy bars military officials from asking about a service member's sexual orientation but also bars the service member from revealing it, and allows the dismissal of a service member if a same-sex orientation is discovered. \"I believe preventing patriotic Americans from serving their country weakens our national security,\" Obama said to applause. Ending the policy requires an act of Congress and will take time, he added. The Defense of Marriage Act effectively bars the federal government from recognizing same-sex unions, even as individual states legalize them. It is one of the most divisive political issues in America, strongly backed by conservatives -- particularly the religious right. \"We have a duty to uphold existing law, but I believe we must do so in a way that does not exacerbate old divides,\" Obama said. \"And fulfilling this duty in upholding the law in no way lessens my commitment to reversing this law.\" He also is pushing for passage of a law guaranteeing full benefits including health care for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender couples and their children, as well as bills to strengthen laws against hate crimes and prevent employment discrimination based on sexuality, Obama said. \"There are unjust laws to overturn and unfair practices to stop,\" he said. \"And though we've made progress, there are still fellow citizens -- perhaps neighbors or even family members and loved ones -- who still hold fast to worn arguments and old attitudes, who fail to see your families like their families and who would deny you the rights that most Americans take for granted.

It comes on the heels of \"Heartstone,\" a World of Warcraft-inspired card game, and \"Heroes of the Storm,\" which features characters from other Blizzard games. \"Perhaps the most amazing thing about Overwatch is the fact that it was kept a total secret, a rarity in this industry,\" Paul Tassi wrote for Forbes. \"Many were guessing that Blizzard's big surprise was going to be a new Hearthstone expansion or something along those lines.\" Immediate reaction to the announcement was mostly positive, though some wondered if Blizzard should just stick to its tried-and-true franchises. Some fans noted references and allusions to weapons and characters from other Blizzard games.\n### Response :", "target": "Gaming company Blizzard debuts \"Overwatch,\" first new franchise in years .\nMultiplayer shooter game features disbanded team of superheroes battling evil forces .\nBeta version of \"Overwatch\" will be available in 2015, game director says .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction: I need a summary of the review.Miami (CNN) -- A Florida prosecutor told the court she intends to seek the death penalty in a case where a 10-year-old girl was found dead in the back of her father's truck. Carmen and Jorge Barahona, the adopted parents of the girl, Nubia Barahona, have been charged with first-degree murder. In Florida, the prosecution must file a notice at the beginning of the legal proceedings if it plans to seek the death penalty. If that's not done, the state waives the right to seek that sentence later in the case. Monday's first appearance on the charges is just the beginning of the Barahonas' criminal case. As it continues, the prosecutors will make it clear whether the death penalty will be sought. The Barahonas have also been charged with eight counts of aggravated child abuse and eight counts of child neglect. Jorge Barahona is charged with an additional count of mutilation or abuse of a dead body. They pleaded not guilty on Monday. In court, the couple sat apart from each other but next to their individual attorneys. Jorge Barahona was wearing a bulletproof vest that showed his bare arms, and Carmen Barahona was in a bright orange jail-issued outfit. Over the years the couple has been at the center of multiple complaints to Florida's Department of Children and Families, with callers reporting that Nubia and her twin brother were locked in bathrooms for long periods of time or bound with tape, according to testimony given in family court. Nevertheless, the children remained in the Barahona home. This case prompted an independent review of the DCF. The panel recently released \"The Nubia Report,\" recommending changes the agency should make in training and technology. The report says when a call is made to the abuse hotline, \"DCF should work with law enforcement to ensure an appropriate joint response when children are not located quickly.\" That change is a result of a phone call to the abuse hotline four days before Nubia's body was found in her father's truck. The call was made by a therapist, saying that the granddaughter of Carmen Barahona told her that the twins were being abused, according to documents released in the case. A DCF investigator went to the house but did not see the children and did not notify the police. The pest control truck that Barahona was driving was found by a road ranger on the side of Interstate 95 in the West Palm Beach area on February 14. Firefighters called to the scene found Barahona and Nubia's brother suffering from burns and a chemical-related illness, said West Palm Beach Police Department spokesman Chase Scott. Hazardous material teams were called in to investigate fumes coming from the vehicle. \"The department of environmental protection went into the rear of the vehicle, moving aside some chemicals and located a body in a bag in the rear of the vehicle,\" said Scott. The body has since been identified by the Palm Beach medical examiner as that of Nubia Barahona. Jorge Barahona did speak to police after he was arrested, according to a probable cause affidavit for the aggravated child abuse charges. The document says that Barahona told police that he drove to West Palm Beach that day \"after he placed his deceased daughter in a plastic bag, which he loaded in the rear of his truck.\" When Jorge Barahona and his son were released from the hospital, the father went to jail and the child went to a therapeutic foster home. Jail is where both Jorge and Carmen Barahona will be staying, since they were denied bond, awaiting a resolution of their case.\n### Response : ", "target": "Prosecutor files notice with the court that death penalty may be sought .\nCarmen and Jorge Barahona plead not guity Monday to murder and other charges .\nThey're charged with first-degree murder in death of their 10-year-old adopted daughter .\nCase led to a review of Florida's Department of Children and Families .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Residents paddle boats through the streets of Santa Cruz, south of Manila. At least three other deaths related to the storms were confirmed earlier. Among the latest victims were children ages 8 and 10, a local reporter who was at the scene of both landslides told CNN. The storm is expected to stall for at least three days north of Luzon -- the largest of the Philippine islands -- dumping more rain on the island nation still reeling from a typhoon last week, said CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera. Heavy rains will remain, but wind will not be much of a factor, Cabrera said. At 11 p.m. ET on Saturday, Parma had maximum sustained winds of 120 kph ( 74 mph), Cabrera said. Aid agencies were in the area assisting survivors. \"There are many uprooted trees, as well as down power lines, making roads impassable in some areas,\" said Wilma Lacaden, a member of the World Vision organization, in a statement. \"Homes constructed of light materials were blown away. In many areas, there is no electricity, and rivers have overflowed, making some towns and villages inaccessible.\" World Vision staffers handed out food and candles to 200 families on Saturday night, and plan to assist another 350 families in nearby Zambales on Sunday, distributing relief packs of food and water, the statement said. Parma, known locally as Typhoon Pepeng, made landfall Saturday afternoon in a rural region of fishermen and farmers in Luzon. Tens of thousands of people fled their homes for safer shelter. Winds whipped the coastline and felled power lines in northernmost Cagayan Province. Debris littered the roads, making evacuations more difficult. Read about the fate of a farming community in Cagayan . Parma avoided a direct hit on heavily populated Manila. In the capital city on Sunday, it was sunny, Manila resident Arturo Fidelino said in an e-mail to CNN, adding the last few days have been \"grueling\" for Filipinos. \"After those two horrendous typhoons ... we've got to start picking up the pieces and move on,\" he said. \"Easy for me to say and for those who were not worst hit by the devastation, but too difficult for those whose houses were wiped out, furniture destroyed and relatives and loved ones nowhere to be found.\" However, he said people have banded together to help one another, and it \"has made me realize that the 'bayanihan spirit' (part of Filipino culture where neighbors help each other) among Filipinos is still alive and kicking. All along I thought that it has just been part of our history and not part of this present times. I was mistaken.\" Fidelino wrote his 73-year-old mother had to be evacuated when her home flooded. The typhoon is expected to dump as much as 8 to 20 inches of rain in areas still water-logged from last week's Typhoon Ketsana. That storm resulted in the heaviest rainfall in 40 years and at one point, 80 percent of Manila was submerged. Ketsana, which swallowed whole houses and buses, killed 246 in the Philippines. An additional 38 are missing, the National Disaster Coordinating Council said. The storm affected nearly 2 million people.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?Hong Kong (CNN) -- New Zealand sport has been rocked by allegations that three former national cricketers are under investigation for alleged match-fixing, according to reports. The International Cricket Council (ICC), the game's governing body, said in a statement that a small number of former New Zealand representatives were under investigation by the anti-corruption unit for alleged involvement in \"fixing activity in historic cricket matches.\" It did not identify those under investigation, but after New Zealand media named those alleged to be implicated, two of the players made statements regarding the investigation. Former test batsman Lou Vincent confirmed he was involved, but said the ongoing investigation made him unable to comment further. \"I wish to let everyone know that I am cooperating with an ongoing ICC anti-corruption investigation that has been made public today,\" said Vincent, who played his last game for New Zealand in 2007. \"This investigation is bound by a number of rules and regulations that mean I am unable to make any further public comment. I will personally talk to the public when I am able to.\" Former all-rounder Chris Cairns, also named in media reports as one of the players involved, told reporters he was unaware of any investigation and had not been contacted by authorities in relation to the matter. Cairns, who played his last game for New Zealand in 2006, had been acting as a television commentator for New Zealand's test match against the West Indies in Dunedin, but left the coverage amid the controversy. Another former player claimed in media reports to be the third individual involved made no public comment. New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White told reporters the organization had been aware of this investigation for a number of months and was \"shocked and surprised by the allegations.\" \"We support the ICC's investigation as corruption has no place in our sport. No current New Zealand players are being investigated. No games played in New Zealand are being investigated. Lastly, no matches under New Zealand Cricket's jurisdiction are being investigated.\" New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told reporters it would be \"very, very serious'' if the allegations were proven. \"New Zealand is a country that sees itself as a very above board, honest place both to do business and to play sport, so it would be deeply concerning if this was factually correct.\" The country regularly ranks as one of the world's least corrupt, recently topping Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index alongside Denmark. Cairns has previously challenged match-fixing allegations in the courts, and won. Last year, he sued Indian cricket official and businessman Lalit Modi in a British Court, after Modi had tweeted allegations of match-fixing relating to Cairns' stint with the Chandigarh Lions in the short-lived Indian Cricket League. Cairns captained the side in 2007 and 2008, playing alongside Vincent in 2008. Modi, who ran the rival Indian Premier League competition, lost his appeal against the court's decision in October 2012, with damages increased to \u00c2\u00a390,000 ($147,459). International cricket has been plagued by the specter of match-fixing in recent years. Players from countries including Pakistan, India, the West Indies and South Africa -- including the late former captain Hansie Cronje -- have been issued punishments ranging up to life bans for under-performance, bribe-taking or passing information to bookmakers. In August, seven were charged in Bangladesh with match-fixing; former national captain Mohammad Ashraful had previously confessed to fixing matches. And in October, six international umpires were stood down following an India TV expose which alleged officials were willing to fix matches at the recent T20 World Cup in exchange for payment.\n### Response :", "target": "International Cricket Council says it is investigating former New Zealand players .\nFormer batsman Lou Vincent say he is involved in match-fixing investigation .\nChris Cairns is seeking clarification from ICC as to whether he is under investigation .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The other two are Mukesh Singh and Akshay Thakur, he said. The horrific attack on the 23-year-old woman in New Delhi on December 16 has prompted angry protests over the country's treatment of women and handling of sexual attacks. India's interior minister has said he was also working with security officials to strengthen laws regarding rape and assault following the attack, which also stirred outrage worldwide. Proceedings against the five adult suspects began Monday, when a New Delhi judge ordered the trial closed after tempers flared inside the packed courtroom. Some lawyers loudly criticized colleagues for offering to represent the suspects, with one young lawyer shouting at Sharma, \"You will not defend those barbarians.\" The magistrate, Namrita Aggarwal, ordered that the hearing take place behind closed doors and barred news outlets from publishing proceedings related to the case without the court's permission, citing concerns about the suspects' safety. The five men in court this week are charged with murder, rape and kidnapping, and could be sentenced to death if convicted. A juvenile court will take up the matter of determining the age of a sixth suspect, who claims to be 17 and therefore not old enough to be tried as an adult, CNN affiliate IBN reported.

Sulzberger died Saturday at his home in Southampton, New York, after a long illness, the paper said, citing his family. He started in 1963 as both publisher of the paper and chairman and chief executive of The New York Times Company. He left the publisher's job in 1992 and the chief executive's job in 1997, handing both reins to his son, the paper reported. The Sulzberger family has helmed the paper since 1896, when it was bought by Adolph Ochs, Sulzberger's grandfather. With the family having such a long history at the Times, some staffers felt like part of the family, too. \"For those of us working at the NYT, the passing of Arthur O. Sulzberger has the sharp feel of a death in the family,\" wrote Times national correspondent John Schwartz on Twitter. Jim Roberts, an assistant managing editor at the Times, called the late publisher a \"monumental contributor to journalism.\" U.S. President Barack Obama said he was saddened by news of Sulzberger's death . \"He was a firm believer in the importance of a free and independent press -- one that isn't afraid to seek the truth, hold those in power accountable, and tell the stories that need to be told,\" Obama said in a statement. When Sulzberger took over the paper in 1963, the paper was respected and influential, often setting the national agenda, the Times said. But it also had financial troubles. Under Sulzberger's tenure, the Times was transformed into a paper with a national scope, sold on both coasts, and at the heart of a diversified, multibillion-dollar media operation that included newspapers, magazines, TV and radio stations, the Times said. \"Mr. Sulzberger's insistence on independence was shown in his decision in 1971 to publish a secret government history of the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers,\" Times columnist Clyde Haberman wrote in Saturday's obituary. \"It was a defining moment for him and, in the view of many journalists and historians, his finest.\" The Nixon administration demanded the Times stop its series of articles on the papers, citing national security, but the newspaper refused on First Amendment grounds. It won its case in the U.S. Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling on press freedom. Sulzberger was also responsible for expanding the newspaper from two sections to four, separating metropolitan and business news and introducing new ones geared toward consumers, the Times said. The sections were SportsMonday, Science Times, Living, Home and Weekend. They were a gamble, aimed at attracting new readers and advertisers, but they became an instant success and were widely imitated, the Times said. A billion-dollar investment in new printing facilities enabled the paper to have a national edition, regional editions, and the daily use of color photos and graphics, according to the Times. \"Punch,\" as many called him, remained on the board of directors until his retirement in 2001. \"Punch will be sorely missed by his family and his many friends, but we can take some comfort in the fact that his legacy and his abiding belief in the value of quality news and information will always be with us,\" wrote his son, Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. People we've lost in 2012: The lives they lived .\n### Response : ", "target": "NEW: Obama calls Sulzberger \"a firm believer\" in a free press .\nHe served as publisher for nearly three decades .\nHe expanded the Times and increased profits .\nHe decided to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971 .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given text.Editor's note: Rachel Motte blogs at www.evangelicaloutpost.com and writes for Wheatstone Academy, a Christian educational program for high school students. She is a graduate of Biola University and the Torrey Honors Institute. Rachel Motte says Rush Limbaugh still can animate conservative popular opinion. (CNN) -- It's no secret that liberals throughout the nation are rejoicing at Rush Limbaugh's supposed status as leader of the Republican Party. I can see why. He's easy to pick on. His rhetoric is extreme, and his personal life has at times been less than picture-perfect. I've heard some pundits refer to Vice President Joe Biden as \"the gift that keeps on giving.\" I imagine the left feels the same way about Limbaugh. Rush was an integral part of my childhood. I must have been 6 or 7 when I started listening in the late 1980s. I remember that my parents and their friends found him refreshing, and I remember that he made them laugh. I memorized his song parodies and even tried to write a few of my own based on the events I heard him talk about. When I was 11, I once spent several hours trying to call his show, redialing after every busy signal, over and over. I never got through. It's probably just as well; I think I had planned to try to talk him into running for president. I no longer think he'd make a good president -- we're all much better off when he sits behind the EIB microphone. Rush taught me a lot about personal responsibility, the value of freedom of speech and the love of country. At 26, I've outgrown many of my childhood habits, but I never outgrew Rush. Have conservatives outgrown him? Is it time to distance ourselves by dismissing him as just \"an entertainer,\" as Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele initially did before apologizing? My friend John Mark Reynolds wrote recently that Rush is \"a shallow thinker\" who will alienate today's young adults rather than draw them in. He argued that Rush's \"insider lingo\" and harsh demeanor are problematic at a time when the Republican Party is losing the young adult vote. Is he right? Has Rush Limbaugh outlived his usefulness to the conservative movement? Should we take a cue from the Democrats' glee and relegate El Rushbo to a back room like an aging and unpopular distant relative? Not by a long shot. Rush doesn't need to be removed as leader of the Republican Party, because he's never held that position, much as Democrats would like you to think he has. He's a vitally necessary part of the conservative movement, but he's no one's leader. Don't give him more credit than he deserves, and don't fall prey to the Democrats' carefully planned attempts to inflate his authority. Steele learned the hard way a few days ago that the opposite extreme is also not true -- Rush is not a mere entertainer. One of his most important contributions to the conservative movement has been his ability to energize the base. This is particularly vital now given the recent election results. Someone has to keep the troops from giving up, and like it or not, for now that someone is Rush. It doesn't really matter whether he's a shallow thinker. What does matter is that he knows how to prod people into action. That's all well and good, but is it sustainable? What works for me and for the many other \"Rush babies\" out there may not work for our younger siblings. Thanks to the Obama campaign, new activists aren't going to be as easily attracted by witty aphorisms and wordplays as previous demographics were. President Obama's impressive rhetorical skills appeared to raise the level of public discourse during the campaign. As far as I can tell he didn't actually say anything new, but so many things sounded new when he said them. I don't think he changed the content of the age-old feud between right and left, but he did change the style, providing a stark contrast to the admittedly strident tones of some on the right. That's going to change the way young people all over will approach the political process; after all, 66 percent of the 29-and-under crowd voted for Obama. Rush's personal influence will decline because of this shift in rhetorical style, but we're not yet at the point where it is unimportant. The current crop of college students may not call themselves \"dittoheads,\" but their mentors and heroes within the movement still do, and that will continue to be significant for a while yet. Do we need leaders who can inspire the next generation of young conservatives? Absolutely. Is Rush the best man for that job? At this point, yes, though that will probably change in the next few years. One thing is likely -- the next big conservative leaders who do resonate well with the age group that favors Obama will cite Rush as a major influence. His work won't end with him. And that's as it should be.

The European Union, NATO and a multi-national naval force called Combined Task Force 151 have conducted anti-piracy missions in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia since 2009. \"There is no alternative to their continued presence as long as Somali pirates threaten major trade routes in this region,\" Mukundan added. Worldwide, pirates have killed six and taken 448 crew hostage in 2012, according to the report. It noted piracy had increased in West Africa, off the coasts of Nigeria, Benin and Togo. Pirates hijack Greek-operated tanker off Togo coast . Attacks there were often violent and targeted tankers carrying refined oil products that can be easily sold, it added. \"There continues to be a serious problem with under-reporting of attacks in this area,\" Mukundan said. \"This may be because of a fear of reprisals or a feeling that little will change as a result.\" In Asia, the waters off Indonesia were most prone to pirate attacks, with 51 incidents, up from 30 in 2011. The report said the attacks were usually opportunistic and targeted ships at anchor.\n### Response:", "target": "Worldwide pirate attacks at lowest level since 2008 .\nDecline due to a steep drop in piracy off coast of Somalia .\nWatchdog warns now is not time to be complacent .\nAttacks increase in West Africa and Indonesia .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Give me a one line summary of the story below:\n### Input:(CNN) -- A U.S. soldier who blew the whistle on his fellow soldiers' links to the killing of civilians in Afghanistan -- and who himself is accused of one slaying --has been moved to solitary confinement for his safety, a source said. Spc. Adam Winfield, 21, told Army investigators that he alerted his father to the civilian killings early this year and told him that he feared for his own life, according to an interrogation tape obtained by CNN. His father tried and failed to get the military to intervene, Winfield's attorney, Eric Montalvo, said. Winfield now is held in a military facility at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington along with other soldiers he said instigated the killings. Some of those soldiers are facing charges in connection with three slayings of civilians, and Winfield would be a key part of any case against them. Winfield contacted his father about the serial killing ring inside his Stryker Brigade squad, and his father, Christopher Winfield, telephoned the Army but with little result, Montalvo said. The father's phone calls, from the family's home in Cape Coral, Florida, and the failure of the Army to take swift action to intervene are the focus of a separate military investigation, an Army spokesman said. A person familiar with the case against Winfield and the other soldiers said Sunday that Winfield had been moved to solitary confinement amidst concerns about his safety. But that person insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Authorities at Lewis-McChord, Winfield's home base, would not comment on any questions about Winfield. But a spokeswoman said that an investigation is underway, although she would not identify who was involved. \"We will not comment on measures taken to ensure this individual's safety,\" Maj. Kathleen Turner, a public affairs officer for Lewis-McChord, said. \"The U.S. Army CID is investigating allegations that a threat was made to one of the defendants; however, we are not releasing any further information associated with these allegations.\" The Army would provide no details of how Winfield and the other defendants are being housed or whether they have been allowed to communicate amongst themselves. Winfield, Cpl. Jeremy Morlock of Wasilla, Alaska; Pfc. Andrew Holmes of Boise, Idaho; Spc. Michael Wagnon, of Las Vegas, Nevada; and platoon leader Staff Sgt. Calvin Gibbs of Billings, Montana, are charged with premeditated murder charges in the killings of three Afghan civilians between January and May of this year. Seven other soldiers face charges ranging from conspiracy and interfering in a military investigation to drug use, specifically smoking hashish, while in Afghanistan. Military reports say that Gibbs kept track of the killed with skull tattoos and collected body parts as souvenirs.\n### Response: ", "target": "Safety concerns prompt Winfield's move, source says .\nSpokeswoman says Army is investigating alleged threat .\nShe does not identify those involved .\n12 soldiers charged in connection to civilians' killings .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction :Read the paragraph below, then write a summary of it. \n### Input:The Reform Party is pulling off a political stunt on Tuesday spanning four boroughs, 230 polling sites, and 5,000 workers. The only question is whether voters will play along. \n  \n Rep. Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, who represents New York\u2019s 7th congressional district , and Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano, who represents NY-15, are virtually guaranteed to win re-election. They\u2019re longtime incumbents in heavily Democratic districts who aren\u2019t facing primary challenges. Under normal circumstances, the New York City Board of Elections therefore wouldn\u2019t set up polling places in these districts on primary day. \n  \n But this year, they will have to, since the tiny Reform Party is hosting a write-in primary. And the party is opening it up to all unaffiliated voters, who don\u2019t belong to a political party. That means that 77,000 independent voters and 23 Reform Party members in Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s district \u2013 which includes Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, much of the Brooklyn waterfront and slivers of southwest Queens \u2013 have the option to vote. Ditto for the 55,000 independents and 38 Reform Party members in Serrano\u2019s South Bronx district. \n  \n The Board of Elections didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, but the Daily News reported that the Board will be running 230 polling sites and employing 5,000 workers, at a cost of $1 million to run elections in these two districts despite their being no actual candidates on the Reform ballot and no challenges on the Democratic side. \n  \n Why would anyone do such a silly thing? \n  \n The Reform Party says it\u2019s meant to send a message that current New York election law governing partisan primaries is broken. \u201cPart of my hope, quite frankly, is that people will see what a needless expense this is and we will call upon their state legislators to fix this right away,\u201d Reform Party spokesman Frank Morano told City & State. \n  \n The Reform Party is pushing for a number of changes to elections, like combining the state and federal contests, which are currently on two different days, and holding non-partisan primaries \u2013 a position that even U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer has endorsed. But the Reform Party hasn\u2019t been able to move the state legislature. \n  \n The Reform Party pulled a similar stunt in 2016 in four districts. It wasn\u2019t open to independents then, just party members, so in Rep. Hakeem Jeffries\u2019 8th congressional district, just two voters cast ballots. Actor Tony Danza tied for first place with a municipal employee. \n  \n The Reform Party doesn\u2019t care much if anybody shows up. The party itself has done no outreach to independent voters in the district. The party\u2019s website contains no information about the races, merely featuring a photo of party chairman Curtis Sliwa and a link to an outdated Daily News article about how Sliwa might run for governor (the party has since endorsed Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro, a Republican, in the race). \n  \n Morano predicted some 3,000 to 5,000 voters would show up to vote in each district, but that number seems quite high when fewer than 10,000 people in the 7th district voted in the last midterm primary, in 2014. And that contest was open to Democrats, which outnumber independents in the district nearly 4-to-1. \n  \n Conventional wisdom holds that most of the voters who show up at the polls in these districts on Tuesday will end up voting for the incumbents anyway, writing in Vel\u00e1zquez or Serrano. Neither Serrano nor Vel\u00e1zquez responded when asked if they would accept the Reform Party nomination. But for Morano, it\u2019s more about making a point about New York\u2019s election laws than getting a candidate on the ballot. \u201cThere\u2019s still been no action at all by the state legislature to fix this, and they ought to be ashamed of themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope the voters keep that in mind.\u201d \n  \n Corrections: This article originally stated that the Reform Party's write-in primaries would cost $25 million. The correct figure is $1 million. Also a quote from Frank Morano in this article originally said \"legislatures\" where it should have said \"legislators.\" City & State regrets the errors. ||||| U\u017eivatel Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez retweetnul u\u017eivatele ken lovett. \n  \n Shockingly - and I\u2019m told this is not a joke - we have ALSO won a primary in the neighboring 15th Congressional District via write-in campaign on the Reform line!

The former aide, Yoon Chang-jung, is accused of making inappropriate advances toward a female student who was hired as a guide while Yoon was in Washington for Park's first official visit to the United States last week. \"I am very sorry that an unsavory incident, which a public official should never be involved in, happened near the end of my visit to the U.S. and hugely disappointed the people,\" Park said Monday at a meeting with senior officials. It was the first time she has commented publicly on the matter. Her office hasn't disclosed details of what Yoon, 56, is alleged to have done, and Washington police have said only that they are investigating a report of a sexual abuse misdemeanor without specifically mentioning Yoon by name. But South Korean news media have widely reported that Yoon is accused of grabbing the buttocks of the young woman, who has not been identified, after drinking with her. Allegations denied . On Saturday, Yoon denied the allegations circulating about him, saying he had patted the woman on the waist once and encouraged her to \"live life to the full in the States and be successful.\" \"I swear I did not have any intention of sexually harassing her, and I did not molest her,\" Yoon said during a news conference in a Seoul restaurant. \"Now, I deeply regret not properly understanding the American culture, and I offer my sincere word of consolation to the guide,\" he said. Yoon also denied allegations in the South Korean press that he had called the woman to his room the morning after the incident and answered the door undressed. He said he had only answered the door in his underwear because he believed it was somebody with an urgent message for him. \"I never imagined my guide would have come,\" he said. He apologized to Park, South Korea's first female president, for the \"trouble\" he had caused. State visit overshadowed . The scandal has cast a pall over Park's five-day visit to the United States, her first high-profile trip since her inauguration in February. Before news emerged of Yoon's dismissal and the allegations against him, the visit had generally been considered a success, with Park and President Barack Obama reaffirming the U.S.-South Korean alliance in the face of recent threats from North Korea. Yoon is alleged to have made the inappropriate advances toward the woman on Tuesday night, hours after Park held talks with Obama. He said his boss, chief presidential press secretary Lee Nam-ki, told him to leave Washington quickly and return to South Korea as soon as the allegations of misconduct began to surface. Yoon said he told Lee he had done nothing wrong and wanted to stay and explain the situation. But he said he followed his supervisor's order and gone to the airport. Lee made a statement to the media on Thursday in Los Angeles (Friday morning in South Korea), saying Yoon had been dismissed after he had \"damaged the dignity of the country.\" Media uproar . By the time Park stepped off the plane that brought her back to South Korea on Friday evening, a media firestorm was raging over the scandal, and opposition parties were demanding a public apology. After earlier apologies by senior members of her staff, Park addressed the matter herself on Monday. She apologized for the \"shock\" that she said the student and her parents must have experienced. South Korea \"will take whatever measures are necessary and will actively cooperate with the U.S. investigation,\" Park said. Yoon, a former journalist and political columnist, served as spokesman for Park's transition team before his appointment, according to the semiofficial South Korean news agency Yonhap. Critics had said at the time he was unsuitable for the job as spokesman, claiming his columns were sensational and biased, Yonhap reported. Journalist Soobin Park reported from Seoul, South Korea.

{"source": "### Instruction:Give me a one line summary of the story below:Chadian troops in Mali killed Moktar Belmoktar, a veteran jihadist who claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on an Algerian gas facility, Chad's armed forces said Saturday. Belmoktar led a group called Al-Mulathameen Brigade (The Brigade of the Masked Ones), which is associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). He was killed during clashes in northwestern Mali, Chadian armed forces spokesman Gen. Zacharia Goubongue said in a statement read on state-run television. U.S. officials said they could not immediately confirm the report. However, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee cheered the news. \"One of the most elusive and deadly terrorists in North Africa has been reportedly killed,\" Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, said in a statement. \"This would be a hard blow to the collection of jihadists operating across the region that are targeting American diplomats and energy workers. French and African forces are helping Malians shed militant Islamist rule.\" In January, more than three dozen hostages died in the terrorist seizure of a natural gas facility in eastern Algeria and the subsequent special forces assaults on it, according to that country's prime minister, Abdul Malek Sallal. Belmoktar had said the attack was in retaliation for Algeria's allowing France to use its airspace to battle Islamist militants in Mali. But regional analysts believe the operation was too sophisticated to have been planned so quickly, and Sallal said the hostage scheme had been hatched over months. The veteran jihadist behind the attack in Algeria . Belmoktar, who lost an eye while fighting in Afghanistan in his teens, long had been a target of French counterterrorism forces. Born in 1972, Belmoktar grew up on the edge of the desert in southern Algeria. He traveled to Afghanistan in 1991 in his late teens to fight its then-communist government. He returned to Algeria as a hardened fighter with a new nickname \"Belaouar\" -- the \"one-eyed\" -- after his battlefield injury, and joined forces with the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) in its brutal campaign against the Algerian regime and civilians deemed to be its supporters. Belmoktar later claimed he met al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden in the Sudan in the mid-1990s. According to Jean-Pierre Filiu, a French scholar who has extensively studied AQIM, Belmoktar rose steadily through the ranks to become the GIA commander for the Sahara. After a popular backlash against the terrorist group in Algeria, Belmoktar switched allegiance to a spinoff group in 2000 and continued to operate in the sub-Saharan region. The GIA was the forerunner of AQIM, which still counts many Algerians in its leadership. Belmoktar remained associated with that group -- but was very much his own man, analysts said. Abdelmalik Drukdal, the overall leader of AQIM, is said to have demoted Belmoktar late last year from his position as \"emir of the Sahel.\" Belmoktar also feuded with a rival commander -- Abdelhamid  Abou Zeid -- one of the most violent and radical figures in AQIM. More than most al Qaeda affiliates, AQIM is divided into often competing groups. To make money, \"Belmoktar increasingly engaged in smuggling, earning the popular nickname 'Mr. Marlboro' ... he also was involved in the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and illegal immigrants,\" Filiu wrote in 2010. The report of Belmoktar's death comes just one day after a U.S. official said Abou Zeid had been killed by French and Chadian forces. The president of Chad said Chadian troops killed the commander, while French military sources said earlier that Abou Zeid, a deputy leader of AQIM, was killed in an airstrike in Mali late last month. Abou Zeid was one of the group's most ruthless commanders, having seized at least a dozen foreigners for ransom. At least two have been killed; several French citizens remain captive. \"He was a senior influential member of AQIM, and his death represents a significant blow to AQIM's efforts to use West Africa, and Mali in particular, as a safe haven,\" the official, referring to Abou Zeid, told CNN.\n### Response : ", "target": "A U.S. lawmaker describes Belmoktar as one of the deadliest terrorists in North Africa .\nBelmoktar was killed during clashes in northwestern Mali, a spokesman says .\nHe led a group associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb .\nBelmoktar had claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on an Algerian gas facility .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Accordingly, the buck stops with me and I must acknowledge responsibility by standing aside,\" he added. Barclays was fined US$450 million last week by British and U.S. regulators after the bank admitted some of its trading desks purposely under-reported its interest rates as part of LIBOR (London interbank Offered Rate) -- an interest rate floor between big banks that is set in London each trading morning. Authorities are also investigating other banks, with Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) understood to have fired some of its traders involved in LIBOR, according to British media reports.

Meanwhile, Agius will stay on as chairman while the board searches for his replacement. Chief Executive Bob Diamond is also facing calls to resign. Both Diamond and Agius are expected to appear before a UK parliamentary committee later this week to face questions about the saga.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?(CNN) -- From the top of a 14-meter mast, Delphine Lechifflart expertly rolls down a length of white ribbon, her taut body pirouetting mid-air, before easing into the arms of her lover. The two French acrobats continue to twirl and swoop, their flying silhouettes growing darker as the sun lowers in the sky behind them. It's a sumptuous image that hushes the crowd who stand gathered, not under a circus big top, but on the banks of a jetty. This, of course is no ordinary acrobatic show, but one performed entirely on a lurching 12-meter yacht in harbors across the world. \"They use the whole boat like it's one big gymnastics apparatus,\" said Dwight Jones, manager at Seattle's Elliott Bay Marina, which recently hosted the enchanting La Loupiote show. \"You couldn't ask for a more dramatic stage -- people can watch from the shore or take their own dinghy and see it from the water.\" A family affair . For acrobat couple Lechifflart, 42, and Franck Rabilier, 44, their distinctive yellow yacht is not simply a stage -- it's also the floating home they share with two daughters; Loeva, 13, and Ondja, five. \"The eldest has done some shows with us, playing a puppet, but the youngest is still too small,\" said Rabilier. \"We're home-schooling them and at the beginning of each year they go back to France to do their exams.\" Since setting sail from Brittany in north west France in 2004, the free-spirited family has traveled from port to port across the globe, performing their remarkable show and surviving on donations alone. \"They just pass a hat around at the end,\" Jones explained. \"People can't believe they're seeing this fantastic performance for free -- it really generates a sense of generosity.\" Show time . From rolling down the top of the mast, to balancing on the boom, and tiptoeing along the railing, the agile acrobats leap across every inch of the boat in two very different 20-minute routines. The first is a slapstick Laurel and Hardy-style comedy, featuring two bumbling sailors racing around the yacht to a lolloping piano soundtrack. As the sun sets, the couple perform their second, more romantic show, in which two lovers tenderly cavort mid-air to rousing classical music. \"In the romantic show, there's an orange-pinkish light behind them while they're doing this beautiful ballet in the rigging,\" Jones said. \"They perform the whole thing without a safety net. It's like nothing you've ever seen before -- people were coming back day-after-day to see them.\" Setting sail . The daring duo began taking circus lessons while university students in Paris, and in 1999 set up their own acrobatic company called La Loupiote -- meaning \"small light\" in old French. They performed in theaters and on the streets, but had dreams of taking the show on the road -- or more accurately, the high seas. \"We both sailed with our parents when we were young,\" Lechifflart explained. \"That was our dream -- to travel the world by boat.\" In 2000 they bought a half-built yacht and spent the next four years getting it into seaworthy shape. Once on the water, the pair spent a year experimenting and refining their unique aquatic-based act. \"The first time we tried it, I had a lot of bruises,\" Lechifflart said. \"It's so much more complicated than working on land.\" \"You have to work with the weather, the wind, the waves -- the boat is constantly moving.\" Circusnavigation . The family's nomadic lifestyle has taken them across Europe, America, and now New Zealand, where they'll be performing over the next month. And after that, who knows? The carefree couple tend to sail the high-seas in whichever direction they wish, surviving on around $800 a month. \"They're not living high on the hog, as they say, but they're loving what they're doing,\" Jones said. \"Their perspective on life is different from people working nine to five -- they don't know where they're going the next day and you've got to respect that.\" And so, like the circus wagons of old, the family of acrobats will point their \"small light\" towards the horizon in search of the next high-flying adventure.\n### Response: ", "target": "French acrobat family travel the world, perform on 12-meter yacht .\nDramatic show on water, described as \"ballet in the rigging\"\nFamily survive on donations, sailing the globe on $800 a month .\nYacht is called La Loupiote, meaning \"small light\" in old French.", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Agents say Hurd, 26, a wide receiver for the Chicago Bears, was arrested Wednesday night after a five-month investigation that began in Dallas, where Hurd once played for the Cowboys. Authorities say he was trying to set up a drug distribution network in Chicago. The complaint states that Hurd met with an ICE undercover agent at a restaurant in Chicago on Wednesday night when, law enforcement officials say, Hurd introduced himself as the person communicating with a confidential informant. Hurd stated that he was interested in purchasing 5 to 10 kilograms of cocaine, at $25,000 per kilogram, and 1,000 pounds of marijuana at $450 per pound per week for distribution in the Chicago area, according to ICE. Hurd said that \"he and another co-conspirator currently distribute about four kilograms of cocaine per week in Chicago but that his supplier couldn't supply him with enough quantity,\" Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said. After they finished negotiating, according to the complaint, the undercover agent presented Hurd with a kilogram of cocaine that Hurd accepted. \"Hurd stated that he plays for the Chicago Bears and that he gets out of practice at about 5:30 p.m., after which he would make arrangements to pay for the kilogram of cocaine,\" ICE officials said in a news release, \"Hurd left the restaurant with the bag of cocaine and was arrested shortly thereafter in the parking lot of the restaurant.\" If convicted, Hurd faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and a $2 million fine for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you outline the content?\n### Input:Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Thousands of protesters marched along Jakarta's main thoroughfare to the presidential palace Wednesday, opposing government plans to increase subsidized fuel prices by 33%. According to police estimates, between 3,000 and 5,000 protestors participated in the largely peaceful march to reject the price hike, which is expected to take effect April 1. The fuel price hikes have triggered nationwide protests, mostly organized by student organizations and labor unions, the Jakarta Globe reported. In Makasser, capital of South Sulawesi and the largest city in east Indonesia, students clashed with anti-riot police and set a vehicle alight. More protests are expected in the days to come. Shubham Chaudhuri, a World Bank economist in Jakarta, says the government's plans will try to correct an imbalance in government spending. In 2011, the government spent 2.2% of GDP on fuel subsidies \"and 1.5% of GDP on infrastructure and 1% of GDP on what we would call social assistance programs,\" Chaudhri said yesterday. Indonesia's parliament has yet to approve the proposal but the government says a rise in fuel prices is necessary on April 1. The plan was announced last week and comes after global crude oil prices have steadily risen on growing tensions with Iran, rising more than 7% this year.

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?(CNN) -- A 37-year-old white supremacist, Kevin William Harpham, was sentenced Tuesday to 32 years in prison for placing a bomb-laden backpack along the route of a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade in Spokane, Washington, in January, the U.S. Justice Department said. Harpham, an unemployed electrician from Colville, Washington, pleaded guilty in September to charges of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to commit a federal hate crime. Shrapnel in the \"improvised explosive device\" contained anticoagulant to prevent blood clotting, authorities said. After he is released from prison, Harpham will serve the rest of his life under court supervision, federal prosecutors said. \"Harpham admitted that he is a white supremacist and white separatist, and that he placed the explosive device at the march with the intent to cause bodily injury to the person or persons in order to further his racist beliefs,\" a Justice Department statement said. Federal prosecutors had recommended that Harpham be sentenced to 32 years in prison, according to court documents. He was sentenced in federal court in Spokane. The January 17 march was attended by about 2,000 people, including racial minorities, authorities said. \"Today, Mr. Harpham faces the consequences of his hate-filled act. A prototypical 'lone wolf' such as Mr. Harpham presents a particularly vexing threat -- with nothing foreshadowing a carefully planned attack,\" Laura M. Laughlin, special agent in charge of the FBI Seattle office, said in a statement. Said Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the civil rights division, in a statement: \"Acts of hate like this one have no place in our country in the year 2011, but yet, unfortunately, we continue to see attempted violence in our communities due to racial animus.\" The backpack containing the device was discovered, and no one was injured. But law enforcement officials said that if Harpham had succeeded, many people could have been harmed. He had packed a 6-inch steel pipe with 100 grams of black powder and more than 100 fishing weights, which were intended to be shrapnel. In addition, Harpham coated the weights with an anticoagulant. According to court documents, he intended to set off his bomb using a transmitter and receiver from a remote car starter device. The plea agreement says Harpham's DNA was matched to the backpack; investigators tracked his purchase of the fishing weights to a local Walmart store and the purchase of the remote triggering mechanism to an Internet transaction; and they retrieved a camera from his home that contained pictures Harpham had taken of himself at the march.\n### Response : ", "target": "NEW: Kevin William Harpham is prototypical \"lone wolf,\" FBI says .\nNEW: The 32-year sentence is what prosecutors sought .\nHarpham is a white supremacist who says he meant harm, a document says .\nA backpack with a bomb, shrapnel and anticoagulant was traced to Harpham .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction :Can you walk me through the main ideas?If you can't make it to SXSW, here's the next best thing: The Texas Nationalist Movement, which is exactly what it sounds like, will be holding a rally tomorrow in front of the state capitiol in Austin to push for a referendum on secession from the United States. \n  \n As with any half-decent declaration of independence, the group's resolution has a list of grievances: Specifically, the federal government has failed the protect its borders, and \"implemented thousands of laws, mandates and agencies in violation of the United States Constitution that have invaded the sovereignty of the State of Texas.\" \n  \n But wait: This story actually gets stranger. As the Houston Press reported, the Texas Nationalist Movement's secession rally is being sponsored by none other than state Rep. Leo Berman. You may remember Berman as the man who introduced a bill to force the President of the United States to prove his citizenship (again), and, when asked for proof, cited YouTube videos he'd seen because, \"YouTubes are infallible.\" He's also sponsoring a bill to save state courts from the scourge of Islamic Sharia law. \n  \n So why is a state legislator promoting a secession rally? The Press caught up with Berman, who explained that while he \"very strongly\" does not support secession (statehouse rallies need a legislative sponsor), he doesn't think it's such a terrible idea either: \n  \n He says he has \"no qualms\" about supporting a secession rally. Is there any group out there whose message is so far out, so radical and dangerous that he would refuse to be a legislative sponsor for them? \"I'm very, very, very strongly pro-life,\" he says. \"So I would not support an abortion-type rally.\" \n  \n Man's got to stand for something. \n  \n Support for secession has a long and rich history in the Lone Star State. According to a 2009 poll, 48 percent of Texas Republicans agreed that the state \"would be better off as an independent nation.\" That came after GOP Governor Rick Perry told reporters at a tea party in Austin that if the federal government didn't change its ways, secession might be an option. And in 2009, a Kerr County resident was arrested for claiming to be a sheriff's deputy for the \"Republic of Texas.\" For more, check out our interactive map on US secession movements. \n  \n Also of note: Although the group's poster features a severely mutton-chopped Sam Houston calling for Texas independence, the real Sam Houston famously took an unpopular stand against Texas secession on the eve of the Civil War. As he put it: \"The Union is worth more than Mr. Lincoln. I was denounced then. I am denounced now. Be it so!\" ||||| AUSTIN \u2014 The Texas Nationalist Movement marked Texas Independence Day with a rally on Saturday at the Capitol urging Texans to save the state by seceding from the United States. \n  \n A small but enthusiastic group of Texans gathered on the steps of the Capitol, as an assortment of massive Texas flags blew above them in the chilly afternoon breeze. \n  \n Outrage was spread evenly toward Democrats and Republicans as leaders of the movement expressed their disgust for the growing national debt and the federal government's treatment of Texas. \n  \n \"Texas can take better care of itself than Washington,\" said Lauren Savage, vice president of the movement. \"We are here to raise interest in the Legislature of the possibility of secession to cure the ills of America.\" \n  \n Members are demanding that state lawmakers introduce a bill that would allow Texans to vote on whether to declare independence. \n  \n Fed up with federal mandates, the burden of unsustainable taxes and disregarded votes, members say secession has been a long time coming. \n  \n \"This is a cake that's been baking for 85 years,\" said Cary Wise, membership director of the Texas Nationalist Movement. \"All this administration has done is light the candles.\" \n  \n Demonstrators said they have had enough of state leaders who are conservative in rhetoric but big government proponents in reality, calling out GOP Gov. Rick Perry as one of the biggest frauds. \n  \n \"I would love to debate Rick Perry live because we could once and for all show that the guy is a big government fraud who claims to be conservative,\" said Eric Kirkland, member of the Constitution Party of Texas. \n  \n Among shouts of agreement from the crowd, Kirkland added that he would love for Perry to walk out of the Capitol at that moment to engage in a debate. \n  \n Demonstrators said taxes are weighing down Texans and are ultimately unsustainable. Gerry Donaldson, host of Our Constitution: Foundation and Principles Radio Show, used bricks to demonstrate the burden dozens of taxes place on Texans throughout their lives. \n  \n \"Washington is encroaching on us in greater levels day by day,\" Donaldson said, as he piled bricks one by one into a bucket held by a fellow member. \"So, what do we do?\" \n  \n Secessionists stressed accountability for a government they say has become corrupted by power and distorted from the framers' original intent. \n  \n Donaldson said he is getting a committee together that will review every bill proposed by state lawmakers and determine if it is constitutional by the people. \n  \n Drawing largely from the Texas Bill of Rights, demonstrators said Texans have the responsibility to take power from the hands of a federal government that has gotten out of control. \n  \n \"The only way is to secede and wipe the slate clean,\" Donaldson said. \"We secede, and then we reform this government based on an absolute return back to basic principles.\" |||||\n### Response :", "target": "\u2013 Yesterday was Texas Independence Day, and one group of Texans celebrated it by rallying on the steps of the state Capitol, urging secession from the US.

Manchester United's Cristiano Ronaldo is the current FIFA World Player of the Year . Born in 1985 on the Portuguese island of Madeira, the 23-year-old cut his teeth with Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon, where his amazing skill and dribbling ability alerted a host of top European clubs. However, it was Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson who nipped in before his rivals to sign Ronaldo for a reported fee of $19 million in 2003. With Manchester United he has won three Premier League titles, two Football League Cups, the FA Cup, the World Club Championship, and the Champions League. After a phenomenal 2007/2008 season, in which he scored 42 goals for Manchester United in all competitions, he was voted FIFA and FIFPro World Player of the Year and European Player of the Year. That season his 31 Premier League goals won him the Golden Shoe award, making him officially Europe's most prolific goal scorer, and he was also the leading scorer in the Champions League, with eight goals. He capped a remarkable campaign by scoring the opening goal, before also netting from the penalty spot, as United beat Chelsea in a dramatic Champions League final in Moscow. Tall, elegant and powerful, Ronaldo is as good in the air as he is with the ball at his feet, as he proved with his header against Chelsea in last year's final. He also possesses a remarkable and unique free-kick technique, managing to bend and swerve the ball to devastating effect, notably with the goal that effectively ended Arsenal's challenge in the semifinals of this year's Champions League. Apart from his success at Old Trafford, Ronaldo is a regular figure for his national side, making his full international debut in 2003 and going on to represent Portugal at the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008 finals. However, despite his god-given talent, Ronaldo still gets criticized in Portugal for allegedly failing to replicate his United form in a Portugal shirt.

Gary Giordano, 50, was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner, 35, was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. The decision to hold Giordano for 16 more days was issued after a jailhouse hearing Monday afternoon, Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said. Giordano will be transferred from the jail to a prison Tuesday morning, Stein said. Meanwhile, clothing found during a search of Aruba's phosphate mines does not belong to the missing woman, Stein said.   The clothing was discovered Friday when crews were searching for Gardner, . Giordano's attorney urged authorities on Sunday to release his client. \"Today, nine days later, four voluntary interviews, two site visits, and more than 30 statements coming from different sources including witnesses and professionals, we cannot deduce that there is hard proof to sustain a demand by the public prosecutor against our client,\" Giordano's attorney, Michael Lopez, said in a written statement. \"In anticipation of any possible reason of prolongation of the client's detention, we can state that no felony has been committed by him,\" Lopez said. \"The Department of Justice at this time does not have any basis to request prolongation of his detention.\" According to Aruban prosecutors, the missing woman and the suspect arrived on the island July 31 from the United States. Lopez said last week that his client came to Aruba on vacation with a female friend he had met on a dating site and has known for years. Giordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner, when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, he allegedly said. Stein said Monday that Aruban authorities are holding Gardner's passport so it is not possible that she has left the country. Lopez denied statements by prosecutors that his client is no longer cooperating with authorities in the investigation. The attorney said in his statement Sunday that Giordano, whom he identified by his initials, GG, has given \"all possible cooperation.\" \"The client has his own business and family in the United States. He has no reason whatsoever to obstruct any investigation,\" Lopez said.

The video, at times grainy and at times super-saturated, looks like what happens if you down three Red Bulls and then swallow an American flag. In just over a minute, the spot, called \"Together,\" manages to show Mount Rushmore, the Grand Canyon (as ridden through by the Marlboro man), the Statue of Liberty, the Constitution, a white picket fence, a lumberjack, a farmer, and a nod to Tom Cruise in Top Gun, all culminating in the most maverick image of them all: a roaring grizzly standing up on its hind legs. The quick camera cuts, propulsive rock, background cheering, and cliched images of Americana could easily call to mind a Pepsi commercial, so to distinguish itself, there's also some empty political rhetoric thrown in for good measure. \n  \n \"This is our movement, this is our moment, this is our morning ... in America,\" says Sarah Palin in a voice-over homage to Ronald Reagan's famous 1984 ad in his bid for reelection. The original \"Morning in America,\" however, at least quoted some concrete statistics, like the fact that the 6,500 Americans getting married that afternoon could look forward to reduced interest rates. It's unclear what the Gipper had to do with those blessed unions, but hey, at least it was something related to a policy and/or accomplishment. Palin just cheers, \"We're gonna stand up and we're gonna speak out, and it may take some renegades going rogue to get us there.\" Then again, what these roving rogues actually want to say when they get there has never been the tea party's, or Palin's, strong suit. \n  \n Together [SarahPalinAK, YouTube] ||||| T \n  \n he video: Before the Senate race in her home state of Alaska has even been called, unofficial Tea Party spokesperson Sarah Palin has released a \"fun,\" exuberant new ad called \"Together\" (view the video below) that celebrates the GOP's election triumph and pays homage to a classic 1984 Ronald Reagan campaign ad. Over images of fireworks, cowboys, and some of Tuesday's Tea-Party-backed winners \u2014 Rand Paul, Marco Rubio, Nikki Haley, Sean Duffy, and Susana Martinez \u2014 Palin says \"this is our movement, this is our moment, this is our morning in America.\" Cue roaring bear. \n  \n The reaction: Palin is \"essentially claiming credit for the GOP tidal wave\" while \"putting the establishment GOP on alert,\" says Glynnis MacNicol at Mediaite. If this reveals anything about her agenda, Republicans have more to fear from such divisive ads than the \"(slim) reality\" of a Palin presidential run. That's too cynical, says Rebecca Kaplan at National Journal.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you outline the content?\n### Input:(CNN) -- Arjun Atwal's narrow victory at the Wyndham Championship secured a slice of golfing history as he became the first Indian-born player to win on the PGA tour. The 37-year-old from Calcutta sank an eight foot par putt on the final hole to win by a shot from American David Toms, and become the first qualifier to triumph on the Tour in 24 years. Atwal lost his Tour card in July but shot a final round 67 at Sedgefield Country Club to finish on 20-under-par and scoop the top prize of $918,000. \"I told my caddie, 'We've got nothing to lose this week. Just go out there and try and win it',\" Atwal told the official PGA Tour website. \"Guys are going to be out there trying to secure their FedExCup spots or whatever. We've got nothing. I don't have a card. I don't have anything. Just go out there and free-wheel it, and that's what I did this week. \"I'm pretty sure it's going to be huge back home,\" Atwal added. \"My in-laws called my wife Saturday and said the coverage was just unreal with me leading. I know there were a lot of people in India and Dubai that watched me play. I've had a lot of messages.\" Atwal started the final round three shots clear of the chasing pack but his lead was gradually whittled away until he was briefly locked in a seven-way tie. But a vital birdie at the 16th saw him regain control. He then recorded par on the final hole by firing his second shot towards the spectators' tent at the back of the green, taking a free drop and getting up and down in two for the win. His victory gives him a two year Tour exemption and a place at the 2011 Masters at Augusta. \"That was huge,\" Atwal said after his landmark victory. \"I was really nervous over that [last] putt. My heart rate was probably 150.\" Atwal used to be a practice partner for world number one Tiger Woods but lost his Tour card last month after slipping too far down the money list when his minor medical exemption ran out. Three years ago Atwal was questioned over an incident in which the driver of a car who was allegedly trying to race him down an Orlando street crashed and died. He was cleared of any wrongdoing after a year-long investigation. Atwal has won on the European, Asian and Nationwide tours, but his first PGA victory was warmly greeted back in his home country. \"I am delighted that Atwal has this great victory on the PGA Tour,\" Sports Minister Manohar Singh Gill said in a statement carried by AFP. \"It is truly a remarkable achievement and puts Indian golfers on an even higher level internationally.\"\n### Response : ", "target": "Arjun Atwal becomes first Indian-born player to win on the PGA Tour .\nAtwal claimed the Wyndham Championship by one stroke from David Toms .\nIndian lost his Tour card last month after slipping down the money list .\nThe 37-year-old is the first qualifier to win on the Tour for 24 years .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?(CNN) -- Croatia held off a furious late onslaught from Euro 2008 co-hosts Austria to win 1-0 in their opening Group B match in Vienna on Sunday. Emmanuel Pogagtetz, left, fouls Croatia striker Ivica Olic to concede the match-winning penalty. The Croatians took the lead in the fourth minute when midfielder Luka Modric coolly slotted home from the penalty spot after Emmanuel Pogatetz clumsily body-checked striker Ivica Olic in the area. Slaven Bilic's team dominated the first half, and should have gone further ahead in the 35th minute but Olic's strike partner Mladen Petric blazed over the bar with a left-foot volley after beating the offside trap to run on to Vedran Corluka's cross. Austria's main threat had come from set-pieces, but they were not able to capitalize on a string of corners. However, the home players kept battling in the second half and squandered a series of chances to level the score in the final 15 minutes. Martin Harnik fired over the bar on 78 as Croatia scrambled to clear the danger, then substitute Ivica Vastic had a powerful header well saved by goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa, who then kept out another low effort by the veteran midfielder. Pletikosa also had to deny a driven shot from Umit Korkmaz, who also came off the bench, while another substitute in Roman Kienast flicked a header just wide from a free kick in the third minute of time added on. Croatia went into the tournament as one of the outside bets, having qualified top of their group ahead of Russia with a victory away to England which eliminated the British team. However, their chances of success were dealt a massive blow when top scorer Eduardo da Silva was ruled out of the tournament due to a broken leg. None of Croatia's strikers managed to score in the warmup matches, and the Arsenal forward's goal-poaching ability was sorely missed on Sunday. The winning goal came after Modric and Olic combined down the left wing from a throw-in, and Pogatetz clearly impeded the striker well away from the Austria goal. The Middlesbrough defender was booked for protesting the referee's decision, but he could have no complaints with the ruling. Austria are the lowest-ranked of the 16 teams at the tournament in 92nd place, but showed great courage against a 15th-seeded Croatia side stacked with attacking talent. But they joined fellow co-hosts Switzerland in losing their opening match, following the Czech Republic's 1-0 victory on Saturday. Croatia next play Germany on Thursday, when Austria take on Poland. Coach Bilic was delighted to start with a victory, but was not so impressed with his team's performance. \"Some players were overwhelmed by playing at a great tournament but we started off with the best possible way -- with a win,\" Bilic told reporters. \"In the first 35 minutes we played excellently, of course the early lead contributed to that. \"They exerted more pressure in the second half and I'm sure that is not to do with a lack of strength from our players. But we confined ourselves to our penalty area too early. \"The last 15 minutes or so when they play all or nothing, you can do that -- but we started in the 60th minute or so. I didn't think the players were happy when they got back in the dressing room. I turned on the CD player and said they should sing because they won.\" Austria coach Josef Hickersberger was left frustrated by his side's failure to take their chances. \"This was the worst possible start you can have in an opening match of a major tournament,\" he said. \"We took some time to recover, during the first 30 minutes we were nervous. \"For the rest of the match we were playing the way we should have been playing. We even dominated in the second half of the match. We had good opportunities but unfortunately we weren't able to score a goal, so we are empty-handed. In our remaining games we need four points to go through.\" Austria: Jurgen Macho; Sebastian Proedl, Emanuel Pogatetz, Martin Stranzl; Joachim Standfest, Rene Aufhauser, Andreas Ivanschitz, Jurgen Saumel, Ronald Gercaliu; Martin Harnik, Roland Linz.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?\n### Input:(CNN) -- Manchester United claimed a controversial 2-0 victory at home to Tottenham on Saturday night to keep up the pressure on English Premier League leaders Chelsea. United stayed within five points of the defending champions, who came from behind to beat Blackburn 2-1 earlier in the day, following a bizarre incident late in the match at Old Trafford. Nani was allowed to put the ball into the Tottenham net while goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes was trying to take a free-kick, after the Portugal midfielder handled when he went down having vainly claimed a penalty. The linesman instantly flagged, but referee Mark Clattenburg over-ruled him and awarded United a second goal to the fury of the visiting team -- who have been on the wrong side of several controversial decisions at Old Trafford in the past decade. United boss Alex Ferguson said Nani had correctly played to the whistle. \"Nani looked back and looked at the referee, and the referee said play on, so what can he do but put the ball in the net,\" Ferguson said. \"You can look at the referee and look at the linesmen and blame them, but the goalkeeper should know better. He's an experienced goalkeeper. I thought he made a mess of it. \"I thought it was a penalty first of all and I think Nani felt he handled the ball. But the referee didn't blow for it.\" Fifth-placed Tottenham extended their historically dreadful run at United's home ground to 21 years without a victory, but had been in the match until the 84th-minute incident. Park Ji-Sung hit the base of the Spurs post in the eighth minute, but Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart rattled his compatriot Edwin van der Sar's woodwork with an even more spectacular effort just after the half-hour mark -- a day after the goalkeeper's 40th birthday. United took the lead five minutes later as Tottenham paid for poor defending, with Serbia center-back Nemanja Vidic stealing in unmarked to head home Nani's curling free-kick. Van der Sar then did well to keep out a fierce shot from Luka Modric, but Tottenham lacked the potency to equalize despite their smooth passing game, with boss Harry Redknapp bringing on Roman Pavlyuchenko and Peter Crouch to replace Robbie Keane and Van der Vaart. Chelsea, still missing injured England midfielder Frank Lampard, needed an 84th-minute winner from Branislav Ivanovic to see off Blackburn, who earlier in the week announced the club is poised to be the first in the Premier League to have Indian owners. Zimbabwean striker Benjani Mwaruwari had headed a 21st-minute opener for his first goal for Rovers, from El-Hadji Diouf's cross, but former France striker Nicolas Anelka leveled three minutes before the break after Didier Drogba nodded down Florent Malouda's cross. Blackburn could have led again in the 81st minute but striker Jason Roberts missed a golden chance, and the Londoners immediately pounced for the winner as Serbian defender Ivanovic headed home Yuri Zhirkov's cross. \"Blackburn could have scored before our goal and we were a little bit lucky,\" Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. \"To win here was important because they were better. We were not great again. Blackburn put us under some pressure and we were not able to play our football.\" Arsenal claimed second place on goal difference above Manchester United after snatching victory at home to bottom club West Ham, with Alex Song heading a late winner following an end-to-end London derby. France midfielder Samir Nasri hit the crossbar with a long-range free-kick and England winger Theo Walcott struck the post after coming on as a substitute, while former England goalkeeper Robert Green kept the visitors in the game with a series of fine saves. But Cameroon international Song finally broke the deadlock with two minutes to play with a diving effort from fullback Gael Clichy's cross. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told reporters that captain Cesc Fabregas should be available for Wednesday's Champions League trip to Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk despite suffering a hamstring twinge. However, Manchester City's hopes of a first league crown since 1968 were dented by a second successive defeat, this time at lowly Wolverhampton, which left the club eight points behind Chelsea. Beaten 3-0 by Arsenal last weekend, City went ahead in the 23rd minute with a penalty from Emmanuel Adebayor -- who was partnered up front by Mario Balotelli in the absence of injured captain Carlos Tevez. But Serbia midfielder Nenad Milijas equalized on half an hour and David Edwards -- who headed against the post in the first period -- gave Wolves a first win since the opening day of the season with a 57th-minute strike. But Wolves remained second from bottom on goal difference below Liverpool, who travel to Bolton Sunday. Everton moved up to seventh place with a 1-0 win at home to Stoke City, with Nigeria striker Yakubu scoring his first goal since April in the 67th minute. Fulham climbed to eighth with a 2-0 victory against Wigan, with U.S. international Clint Dempsey netting both goals in the first half for the home side.\n### Response :", "target": "Manchester United third on goal difference after beating fifth-placed Tottenham 2-0 .\nWin marred by late controversy surrounding second goal scored by Nani .\nChelsea earlier maintained five-point lead with 2-1 victory away to Blackburn .\nArsenal claim second place after snatching late 1-0 win at bottom side West Ham .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Passers-by seemed to notice the girl's singing talent, stopping to listen in the chilly weather, with a few putting money in a bucket at Abby's feet. Abby said the money will help support Taylor's family. A few more stopped to write messages on \"Love Notes,\" little cards designed to encourage Taylor Love through the tough time. \"Her mom reads them to her before she goes to bed at night,\" Abby said. \"Taylor gets excited for them and she loves getting them read to her because she likes knowing that people are supporting her and people are actually thinking of her.\" Taylor has neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects the nervous system.

{"source": "### Instruction: I need a summary of the review.\n### Input : London, England (CNN) -- Britain's military chiefs have been told to prepare for a \"leaner and less centralized\" Ministry of Defence. The warning Friday from Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox marks the latest stage in attempts by the new British government to shake up the country's armed forces and defense spending. In a speech in London, Fox -- just returned from a trip to Afghanistan where Britain has almost 10,000 troops deployed -- said the previous Labour administration had left a \"dangerous deficit\" in the public finances, including an unfunded liability in the ministry's balance sheet of around \u00a337 billion ($57.7 billion) over the next 10 years. Fox steered clear of any announcements on numbers of possible job losses but said he remains committed to a pledge made in opposition to cut Ministry of Defence running costs by 25 percent. \"I don't pretend it is going to be painless,\" he said. But he made it clear that any cuts would be more likely to hit those at the top than those at the bottom. A review of the senior rank structure will be carried out, he said, hinting at probable reductions in the number of senior military positions. \"We cannot demand efficiency from the lower ranks while exempting those at the top,\" he said. Friday's speech came against the backdrop of the ongoing Strategic Defence and Security Review, Britain's first such review in 12 years. The report, scheduled for release at the end of October, will set out what the panel believes should be the shape of the United Kingdom's armed forces in 10 years. Three factors would determine that shape, Fox said: foreign policy goals; an assessment of the character of future conflicts; and anticipated changes in technology. Fox said Britain's future strategic posture should be a \"flexible and adaptable\" one. According to Professor Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank, that reflects the generally held view among Britain's defense establishment that the current strategic environment is one characterized by \"uncertainty and complexity, not by a single existential threat.\" The challenge, according to Chalmers, will be to translate that consensus into agreement on where the ax needs to fall. \"Some of the hardest decisions in the review will be those that involve curtailing legacy capabilities with powerful institutional backing in order to create space for new technologies and new tasks that lack such sponsors,\" he said. Among those legacy items are fighter jet programs and the procurement of two aircraft carriers, both projects reportedly threatened with big cuts.\n### Response:", "target": "\"I don't pretend it's going to be painless,\" Liam Fox says .\nJobs will be cut in the effort to get a \"leaner and less centralized\" ministry .\nHe says cuts are more likely to hit those at the top .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?(CNN) -- Eleven years ago this week, the world faced the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, a new epidemic that infected some 8,000 people, took the lives of 775 individuals, and inflicted $30 billion in damage to regional economies. The emergence of SARS was a wake-up call for the World Health Organization and its members, including the United States. The world had to do more to prevent, detect and respond to new biological threats. This is not just a health challenge; it's a security challenge as well. Infectious diseases -- whether naturally occurring, deliberate or accidental -- have the potential to cause enormous damage in terms of lives lost, economic impact and ability to recover, just as with nuclear, chemical, or cybersecurity attacks. During the anthrax attacks of 2001, 22 people were infected and five people lost their lives here in in the United States. The cleanup cost was more than $1 billion. The global H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 killed 284,000 people worldwide in its first year alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the decade since the SARS outbreak, we have made notable progress. China, for instance, has shown leadership in its transparent approach to the ongoing and rapidly escalating H7N9 influenza outbreak. Under revised WHO regulations, many countries have increased capability and made event reporting more transparent. But 80% of the world's nations still are not prepared to deal with new pandemics, and more can and must be done across the health, agriculture and security sectors to elevate this issue and steer resources toward it. The United States has made addressing infectious disease threats a priority. On Thursday in Washington and Geneva, we are convening 26 countries to launch a Global Health Security Agenda that will accelerate progress on addressing a wide range of global health security threats. With our partners and allies, we'll be intensifying our efforts to meet the challenges of an increasingly globalized world, whether that means the emergence and spread of new microbes, the globalization of travel and food supply, the rise of drug-resistant pathogens, or the risk of an inadvertent or intentional release. At the same time, we'll continue to work to prevent terrorists from developing, acquiring or using biological agents for harm. New diseases are inevitable, but in the 21st century we have the tools to greatly reduce the threat posed by global epidemics. We can put in place a safe, secure, globally linked, inter-operable system to prevent disease threats, detect outbreaks in real time, and share information and expertise to respond effectively. To achieve this goal, we must work more effectively across sectors and governments, harmonize our efforts, identify what works and measure our progress. We invite national leaders, international organizations and nongovernmental stakeholders from around the world to join us in this endeavor. Our security and the lives and livelihoods of our citizens depend on it.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?(CNN) -- Doctors say Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is on her way to a full recovery after a blood clot was found in her head on Sunday night. She was discharged from New York Presbyterian Hospital on Wednesday after spending three days being treated, the State Department announced. Clinton's blood clot was located in the vein between the brain and skull behind her right ear, according to her doctors' statement. It is being treated with blood thinners and did not result in a stroke or any neurological damage. This type of blood clot is called a cerebral vein thrombosis and is relatively rare, said Dr. Mary Cushman, director of the Thrombosis and Hemostasis Program at the University of Vermont and chair of the American Society of Hematology's subcommittee on quality of care. A two-year study conducted in the Netherlands found cerebral vein thrombosis affects approximately 1 in every 100,000 people. In comparison, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 1 in 1,000 people are affected by deep venous thrombosis (DVT) -- a similar clot found most often in the leg. Clinton, now 65, suffered from a DVT in 1998. Anyone who has had a blood clot in the past is at a higher risk of getting one again. About one-third of people with DVT will have a recurrence within 10 years, according to the CDC. \"There are a handful of genetic conditions that predispose someone to these kinds of clots,\" Cushman said. \"That's why you might see two different (types of blood clots) in the same person.\" It's unknown if Clinton has a genetic condition that may increase her risk. Other risk factors for DVT include smoking, use of oral contraceptives, age (the risk increases over age 65) and obesity. Blood clots: 4 things you need to know . A large long-term study published in the journal PLoS One in 2007 found the more frequently a person travels, the higher their risk of blood clots. The blood in veins is fighting gravity to get back to the heart, Cushman said, and needs the leg muscles to help push it along. When a person is sedentary for long periods of time -- especially on a plane or in a car where the legs are in the same position for hours -- the blood can start to clot. Clinton has logged many miles as secretary of state, in addition to the time spent traveling as a former presidential candidate and first lady. Although she plans to step down from the State Department soon, there is a lot of speculation about a run for president in 2016. Blood clots wouldn't deter her from campaigning if that's what she chooses, said Dr. Jack Ansell, an expert in thrombosis at Lenox Hill Hospital who is not involved in Clinton's care. \"Travel is potentially an issue for the secretary, but I would imagine that when she travels she's not sitting in a coach seat, cramped up and sitting still,\" Ansell said. Experts recommend anyone with a history of blood clots stand up and walk every couple hours during long trips. They should also avoid alcoholic drinks prior to traveling -- dehydration can contribute to the formation of blood clots. Doctors often recommend wearing compression stockings, which help move blood along in the legs by narrowing the veins. Clinton may remain on blood thinners for several months or for the foreseeable future, said Dr. Evan Lipsitz, chief of vascular surgery at Montefiore Medical Center, who is not treating the secretary of state. \"The current recommendations are for at least three months of treatment with a blood thinner following a clot. Each case much be individualized depending on the size and location of the clot and the risk of bleeding as a result of the treatment,\" Lipsitz said. Often patients on these medications are monitored closely, having their blood checked once a month or every couple of months to ensure the dosage is right. Lipsitz makes his patients aware of typical blood clot symptoms (sudden pain or swelling in the limbs, or chest pain and shortness of breath caused by a blood clot traveling toward the lungs) so they can spot them and get treated quickly. Patients on blood thinners need to avoid physical trauma, Cushman said, but are otherwise fine. So while an NFL player or a construction worker would probably be out, Clinton's career going forward is still full of possibilities. \"I think her future is as good as her past,\" Ansell said. \"She should recover fully and get back to work.\" CNN's Mary Snow, Danielle Dellorto and Elise Labott contributed to this report.\n### Response: ", "target": "Hillary Clinton's blood clot is called a cerebral vein thrombosis and is relatively rare .\nAnyone who has had a blood clot in the past is at a higher risk of getting one again .\nIt's unknown if Clinton has a genetic condition that may increase her risk .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The 26-year-old actor best known for \"High School Musical\" went to rehab in 2013 but was elusive about what he sought treatment for. Now, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Efron is coming clean about his battle with alcohol and drug use. \"It's a never-ending struggle,\" the actor said of his issues with addiction. \"I was drinking a lot, way too much.\" There were drugs as well, he added. The problem erupted for Efron as he tried to work his way from being the teen star of \"High School Musical\" and \"Hairspray\" to more adult roles with movies such as \"The Lucky One\" and \"The Paperboy.\" \"I had done films back-to-back-to-back. I was burnt out,\" he said. \"There was something lacking, some sort of hole that I couldn't really fill up. I was just so deep into my work, it was really the only thing I had.\" That period of his life left him feeling isolated, he said, but in hindsight he can see how it helped him grow. \"I mean, you're in your 20s, single, going through life in Hollywood, you know?\" he told The Hollywood Reporter. \"Everything is thrown at you. I wouldn't take anything back; I needed to learn everything I did.\" Part of that learning experience has been aided by therapy, and joining Alcoholics Anonymous. \"I just started going, and I think it's changed my life,\" Efron said. \"I'm much more comfortable in my own skin. Things are so much easier now.\" This year, Efron is hoping that a buttoned-up lifestyle -- complete with daily workouts and a 9 p.m. bedtime, or so he says -- paired with his newfound wisdom will help him steer his career in the direction he wants it to go. Earlier this year he starred in and produced the comedy \"That Awkward Moment,\" and on May 9 his comedy with Seth Rogen, \"Neighbors,\" will arrive in theaters. \"It's impossible to lead an honest and fulfilling life as a man and not make mistakes and 'fess up to them when you need to,\" Efron said. \"I'm a human being, and I've made a lot of mistakes.

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.(CNN) -- Sheltered from the Atlantic Ocean on a stunning bay in the western tip of metropolitan France, the city of Brest has at its heart one of the country's most animated harbors. With its proximity to the British Isles, this area of France is steeped in Celtic heritage. As such, accordions are eschewed for bagpipes and the locals display a preference for zesty ciders over fine wines. The region even has its own Celtic language, \"Breton\", which is still spoken by nearly 200,000 people. Brest was sadly all but destroyed in the \"Battle of Brest\" during World War II. It has since been completely rebuilt and is now a sophisticated city that hosts some of Europe's most theatrical sailing festivals. By far the most prominent of these is \"Les Tonnerres de Brest\" (\"Brest Festival of the Sea.\") Every four years, more than 2,000 traditional boats sail from countries as far flung as Madagascar and Mexico to take part in the event, which is attended by nearly 700,000 avid spectators. This year marks its 20th anniversary and, according to the festival organizers, it will be \"the biggest and most spectacular event yet.\" From July 13, Brest will be transformed into five \"villages,\" representing this year's five honorary countries: Mexico, Norway, Indonesia, Morocco and Russia -- all of whom are sending a minor flotilla of historical boats. From village to village, visitors will be able to learn about each country's maritime heritage and sample its music, food and handicraft. \"There is no other festival quite like it if you like classic boats,\" said Adam Purser, who has sailed from England to Brest three times since 2000. \"Everywhere you look there are tall ships and the atmosphere is fantastic. There is good food and music and you get to race your ships along a beautiful coastline. I wouldn't miss it for the world,\" he said. But it's not just an event for maritime history buffs, this year the festival is also welcoming modern boats. Racing enthusiasts will be able to see the finish of the New York to Brest multi-hull transatlantic \"Krys Ocean Race\", featuring some of the world's fastest trimarans. \"The festival has something for everyone. It's really becoming a universal exhibition of all types of boats,\" said Chantal Guillerm, the festival's director of communications. \"Les jeudis du Port\" (Thursdays at the harbor) Those who can't make it to the summer's main maritime festival can still experience Brest's unique harbor each Thursday during the summer months when it is transformed into a vibrant arts space, packed with live street theater, concerts, comedy and markets. The music on offer is as eclectic as it is exciting, with a mixture of folk, rock, French chanson, world music, jazz, and classical acts taking the stage throughout the summer. Astropolis . In recent years France has produced some of the world's finest electronic bands and Brest has played an integral part in the scene's development. Every summer for nearly 20 years the city has hosted one of the most anticipated electronic music festivals in the country -- \"Astropolis\" -- a three-day musical feast that takes place in August each year. But there are also plenty of things to do and see outside the summer festival season -- especially if sailing, seafood and marine life are high on your agenda. Oceanopolis . For years Brest has been the European capital of oceanography. According to the University of Brest, more than 60% of France's maritime researchers and engineers have made the city their home, so it's perhaps no surprise that a giant marine pavilion has emerged there. The venue is much more than your average city aquarium; it is an ocean discovery park covering nearly 10,000 square meters, with 50 individual aquariums housing in excess of 1,000 animal species. Through three pavilions dedicated to polar, tropical and temperate marine ecosystems, \"Oceanopolis\" aims to immerse visitors in an underwater universe representing flora and fauna of oceans around the world. There is also a fourth pavilion that houses the temporary exhibitions on marine biodiversity. The current exhibit, titled \"The Abyss,\" is dedicated to the weird and wonderful creatures that hide in the deepest part of our oceans. Castle Of Brest . Once owned by King Richard II of England, the impressive medieval fortress is the city's most important landmark that, by sheer fortune, was spared from destruction during the heavy bombing of World War II. The castle and its ramparts offer stunning views of the city and inside the fortress hides the city's branch of the \"Naval Museum of Paris,\" which retraces 17 centuries of Brest's longstanding naval history. Tanguy Tower . Built on an enormous block of granite, the \"Tanguy Tower\" is a sightseer's favorite, with its medieval turret offering views of the long-winding Penfield river cutting right through the city. The tower is also home to the Brest Museum - where a series of huge dioramas take visitors on a picture journey through the city's origins and development, showcasing life in Brest before it was bombed.\n### Response:", "target": "Brest is one of France's most historically significant harbors .\nThe city is located in the region of Brittany and is steeped in Celtic heritage .\nThe beautiful coastline and huge harbor has made Brest a popular sailing destination .\nEvery four years the city hosts one of the biggest international maritime festivals in the world .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?London (CNN) -- They are two of Europe's premier art destinations, filled with treasures amassed over centuries. Now the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg is presenting a \"mini-museum\" inside the Prado Museum in Madrid, showcasing paintings by Velazquez, Titian and Caravaggio, as well as ancient gold artifacts from Siberia. \"The Hermitage in the Prado\" is the second part of an exhibition exchange -- initiated as part of Spain-Russia Dual Year 2011, dedicated to promoting and strengthening the economic, political, cultural and scientific ties between the two nations -- that saw the Prado exhibiting precious items from its own extensive collection in the State Hermitage Museum in February 2011. \"It was really the finest show that's ever come out of the Prado and it reflected the idea of our museum, as it were, nestling inside theirs,\" said Gabriele Finaldi, Deputy Director of the Prado Museum and curator of the exhibition. Now some 180 items from the Hermitage's world-class collection are nestling inside the many galleries of the Prado, ranging from archaeological pieces all the way to modern masterpieces by Kazimir Malevich. But, Finaldi said, this isn't a typical touring exhibition. \"You've got to remember that the Hermitage has not been visited by many Spaniards and it's still far away and it's still mysterious and exotic and we wanted the public to experience something of the special character of it, which is of course a palace as well as a museum,\" said Finaldi. Special furniture and ornaments typical to the Hermitage, such as granite vases, were brought in to decorate the galleries to make it look more like the Russian museum, whose collection was begun by the Empress Catherine the Great. In a statement to the press in November, Mikhail Piotrovsky, director of the Hermitage, said: \"With this exhibition, we wanted to tell the story of our museum and its collection and the history of the Tsars.\" In addition to the objects collected by the voracious Catherine the Great are ornate Scythian gold objects from the collection of earlier Tsar, Peter the Great. \"Never before has there been an exhibition like this, from and about the Hermitage, abroad,\" Piotrovsky continued. Aside from both having world-class collections, Finaldi points out that they have something else in common -- both have their origins as royal collections. \"One can think of Catherine the Great in Russia and Charles the Fourth here in Spain, who collected with a real passion, because they were personally interested but also because they knew it brought glory to the monarchy and to the country,\" said Finaldi. \"They're also the two extremes of Europe, the Hermitage at the very top end and the Prado at the bottom end, so they're the two extremes of Europe coming together, showing things that are on one level very similar and on another level, very different,\" he finished.\n### Response : ", "target": "State Hermitage Museum displays items from its collection at the Prado Museum in Spain .\nExhibition is part of a cultural exchange program between Spain and Russia .\n\"The Hermitage in the Prado\" show includes fine art paintings and ancient Siberian artifacts .\nInstitutions share similarities: Both originally royal collections, both at \"extremes\" of Europe .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Police tape cordons off the crime scene in Binghamton, New York, on Saturday. \"From the people close to him, the actions that he took were not a surprise to them,\" Chief Joseph Zikuski told reporters at a noon news conference. The police chief said that \"some of this behavior on his part wasn't a total shock,\" but did not elaborate what, if any, previous behavior he meant. A federal law enforcement source identified the suspected gunman as Jiverly Wong. Zikuski said Wong, who was from Vietnam, was 41 and had changed his last name to Voong. \"Apparently people were making fun of him. He felt he was being degraded because of his inability to speak English, and he was upset about that,\" Zikuski said.  Watch police question whether teasing led to shooting rampage \u00bb . Wong also was upset about recently losing a job, Zikuski said. He had been taking English language classes at the American Civic Association, the site of Friday's shooting rampage, until dropping out the first week in March, the police chief said.  Watch investigators struggle to make sense of shooting \u00bb . Thirteen people were slain in the association, which helps refugees and immigrants, before Wong apparently turned the gun on himself, authorities said. Four others were wounded and are in local hospitals. They are all expected to survive, Zikuski said. Angela Leach, a representative of the American Civic Association, read a statement through tears at the news conference.  View photos from the scene in Binghamton \u00bb . \"Whatever drove this individual to do what he did I cannot possibly fathom,\" she said. \"But we will come out of our grief and sadness more resolute in our mission and more dedicated than ever to help people realize the dream of American citizenship.\" Zikuski said Wong was wearing body armor, possibly indicating that he had prepared for a confrontation with police. Zikuski said the suspect was heavily armed and that the victims had \"multiple gunshot\" wounds from Friday's massacre.  Watch the latest news from Binghamton \u00bb . \"He must have been a coward, he decided to end his own life,\" when he heard police sirens, Zikuski said. By late Saturday, police had begun the grim work of notifying the family members of the victims. Omri Yigal said one of Voong's victims was his wife, Dolores, who was taking English classes at the center to better herself. Yigal said he had no anger for the shooter. \"My thoughts are on my wife. I don't have time for that now,\" he said. Yigal said he felt \"grief for my wife and that's it.\" \"She's come so far,\" he said haltingly, his arms crossed and his eyes to the ground. \"So much.\" President Obama, speaking in Strasbourg, France, after a NATO summit, said his administration is in communication with law enforcement officials in Binghamton. \"I am heartbroken for the families who survived this tragedy and it just underscores the degree to which in each of our countries we have to guard against the kind of senseless violence that the tragedy represents,\" Obama said. Authorities received a 911 phone call at 10:31 a.m. Friday from a receptionist hiding under a desk alerting them to the shooting. The receptionist, who had pretended to be dead before crawling under a desk, said she was shot in the stomach, Zikuski said.  Watch Zikuski give a timeline of the shooting \u00bb . \"[She's a] very brave lady,\" the police chief said. Police arrived on the scene minutes after the phone call; by that time, the shooting had stopped. The woman is among the four wounded, he said; she is in serious condition. Before entering the building's front door, Wong had apparently used his father's car to barricade the building's door, Binghamton Mayor Matthew Ryan said. Wong then entered the building front door armed with two handguns, and without saying a word, began shooting, police said. Ryan said two semi-automatic handguns -- a .45-caliber and a 9-millimeter -- found at the center were licensed to Wong. Authorities executed a search warrant at Wong's home in Johnson City, just outside Binghamton, where he lived with his family, Ryan said. \"They took a computer hard drive -- they took an empty long gun case, and some other bags,\" he said. State police received a tip in 1999 from a confidential informant who told them Wong was planning a bank robbery, Zikuski said. The information indicated Wong had a crack or cocaine habit and owned handguns, Zikuski said, and he did not provide additional information.

{"source": "### Instruction :Can you give me the gist of this text?(CNN) -- Some of the worst fighting to hit Somalia's capital city in recent months uprooted nearly 34,000 people in less than a week, according to a United Nations report released Monday. A young girl feeds her baby brother at a refugee camp  on the outskirts of Mogadishu, Somalia. Relief workers said the fighting between the Somali government and rebels over Islamic law has left Somali civilians with the choice of facing bloody battles or fleeing to squalid camps. The displaced people have found shelter in already overcrowded camps in and around Mogadishu, while others have fled into neighboring Kenya, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). OCHA said that an estimated 34,000 people were displaced by the fighting between insurgents and Somalia's government from May 8-14. Although Somalia's border with Kenya is officially closed, an estimated 5,000 displaced Somalis arrive every month in the U.N. refugee camps in the Kenyan border town of Dadaab, according to Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF. \"The situation is simply scandalous,\" said Joke Van Peteghem, who heads the MSF mission in Kenya. \"These refugees have risked everything to escape the fighting in Somalia. Now some are telling us they would rather take their chances in Mogadishu than die slowly here.\" One nurse called the refugee camps in Kenya \"public health time bombs.\" \"The refugees, many of whom are already suffering from serious war-related injuries or illnesses, are packed together without the bare minimum to survive,\" said Donna Canali, who worked for MSF at Dagahaley Camp. \"After all these people have endured, how can their most basic needs continue to be so woefully neglected?\" Nearly a quarter of the more than 90,000 refugees at Dagahaley suffer from acute malnutrition, according to MSF. MSF is calling on the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Kenya's government, and international donors to help alleviate the \"dire living conditions\" at the camps in Kenya which house more than 270,000 Somali refugees. More than 100 people have died in the latest fighting in Somalia, and hundreds more have been wounded in the bloody insurgency, government officials said last week. The violence stems from an interpretation of sharia, or Islamic law. Somalia's new president, Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, recently approved implementing sharia, but the al-Shabab rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form. On Sunday, al-Shabab seized control of Jowhar, the president's hometown about 55 miles (88 km) north of Mogadishu, according to a local journalist. The violence is exacerbating the already precarious humanitarian situation in Somalia, where an estimated 40 percent of the country's population -- more than 3 million people -- need humanitarian support, according to the U.N. The fighting erupted days after a mortar attack on Somalia's parliament that killed six people and wounded more than a dozen others on April 25. The fatalities included a soldier and three children who were killed when the rounds struck a nearby school, a police spokesman said. Members of parliament were meeting when the attack occurred, but none of them was injured, an official said.\n### Response :", "target": "Fighting in Somalia uproots 34,000 civilians in a week, report says .\nCivilians have choice: Face bloody battles or be forced into squalid camps .\nMore than 100 have died in most recent fighting .\nViolence stems from an interpretation of sharia, or Islamic law .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Audrea Gause, 27, pleaded guilty to a charge of larceny over $250 and was sentenced by a Superior Court judge to two and a half to three years in prison, according to a statement from state Attorney General Martha Coakley. \"It is disturbing that this defendant would attempt to steal from the real victims of the marathon bombing through fraud and deceit,\" Coakley said in a statement. Gause was awarded the $480,000 after submitting forged medical records in June 2013 indicating she had suffered a traumatic brain injury in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that resulted in long-term memory loss, impaired speech and the loss of some motor function that would require future surgery, the attorney general's office said. An investigation into Gause began after the Massachusetts attorney general received a tip that she was not in Boston at the time of the bombing, Coakley told a news conference in July. The attorney general's office said that the investigation determined that Gause was not a patient at Boston Medical Center on the day of the bombing nor Albany Medical Center at the times she had indicated on her notarized claim form. Investigators were later able to secure the nearly half a million dollars that Gause stole and will return it to One Fund Boston, according to the attorney general's office.

{"source": "### Instruction :What's the text mainly about?\n### Input:(CNN) -- The man tasked with investigating the World Cup bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments resigned Wednesday, plunging world football into turmoil. Michael Garcia's resignation followed world governing body FIFA's decision to throw out his appeal after he complained about the way his report into the bidding process had been summarized by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert -- FIFA's independent ethics adjudicator. \"I disagree with the Appeal Committee's decision,\" said the American lawyer Garcia -- the chairman of the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee -- in a public statement. \"It now appears that, at least for the foreseeable future, the Eckert Decision will stand as the final word on the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process. \"No independent governance committee, investigator, or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organization.\" FIFA president Sepp Blatter said he was surprised by Garcia's resignation but that the \"work of the Ethics Committee will nonetheless continue.\" \"Pending the election of a new chairman of the Ethics Committee by the FIFA Congress, the FIFA Executive Committee will appoint an acting chairman to serve as a replacement for Mr Garcia,\" added Blatter, who will be at FIFA ExCo's meeting in Marrakech on Thursday and Friday. However Jerome Champagne, who is standing against Blatter in the 2015 FIFA presidential election, said Garcia's decision was \"a step backwards.\" \"We need to know what happened before and after the 2 December 2010 vote,\" added Champagne, referring to the date Russia and Qatar won the right to stage the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. \"When will the facts be known fully, transparently and above all without suspicion? When will we be able to start rebuilding FIFA's image? And we need to protect the World Cup.\" Garcia said his decision to resign had also been in influenced by FIFA's \"lack of leadership.\" \"Now even FIFA's very own lead investigator has recognized what many of us have warned for months: its self investigation process is neither valid nor credible,\" said U.S. lawyer David Larkin, who has been a campaigner for greater accountability from FIFA. It has been a difficult few months for Garcia. In September the American said for the first time that his report should be made public with redactions. FIFA rejected his request on the grounds that witness confidentiality for his work could prove difficult to sustain if the report was published. Then Eckert published his summary, prompting Garcia to respond by saying the German judge's 42-page report contained \"numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations.\" In his resignation statement Garcia went even further. \"A brief I filed with the FIFA Appeal Committee on November 24, 2014, outlined the Eckert Decision's most serious failings,\" said the American lawyer. \"Among other points, the brief explained why, when viewed in the context of the Report it purported to summarize, no principled approach could justify the Eckert Decision's edits, omissions, and additions.\" After Eckert's summary was published, Garcia also faced pressure from two whistle-blowers. Phaedra Al-Majid and Australian Bonita Mersiades gave evidence to Garcia and claim he broke his promise over an offer of anonymity if they helped with his investigative report. The two women insist that assurances were given to them both in private and public that they would not be compromised after agreeing to give evidence \"through a sense of natural justice and a desire to bring closure to a long running chapter in our lives.\" The women were not identified by name, but they contend they were \"clearly identifiable\" in the summary of Garcia's report. However, FIFA's disciplinary committee said Tuesday there \"were no grounds to justify the opening of disciplinary proceedings\" given \"the breach of confidentiality claim had no substance.\" Responding to Garcia's resignation, Mersiades welcomed his decision, given he \"agrees with what many of us have long stated -- that FIFA is incapable of reform or cultural change with its current leadership.\" Al-Majid described the American's departure from FIFA was \"one more, emphatic exposure of FIFA's self-protecting corruption.\" She added: \"FIFA has no ethics. Its rules are a farce. Not even an extensive, purportedly independent, two year investigation and report could affect its culture. \"Why would anyone believe or trust anything it says?\"\n### Response :", "target": "Independent Chairman of the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee resigns .\nMichael Garcia says problem with FIFA \"culture\"\n\"Lack of leadership\" at FIFA, says American lawyer .\n\"Self investigation process is neither valid nor credible,\" says one FIFA reformer .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

They talk about the school day, their homework and even joke that Sheliah can't remember what she ate for lunch. The fourth-grader wonders aloud, \"What did we have? We had something good.\" But it's hardly a homecoming for any of them. The Wash family has been homeless since 2007, after Sheila lost her government job. She says unemployment benefits quickly ran out and, as she searched for a job, the family was forced to move six times in the last two years. They're now living in the Family Forward Shelter in Washington. \"I just thank God we have a roof over our head right now. You have to accept the things that come to you. You don't like them but, you know, until you can get your foot forward, you do what you have to do. We just keep going,\" Wash said. Wash's situation was only made worse as the economic recession set in. Jobs became harder and harder to find with more competition for each position. She says she's still searching. The Washes are part of the changing face of homelessness in America today. For years, homelessness has been depicted as that of an individual man or woman living on the street and begging for money. But with the perfect storm of the foreclosure crisis and the faltering economy, more and more families are becoming homeless. According to a recent count by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, the number of homeless families in the Washington region alone has jumped 15 percent since last year. There are several national estimates of homelessness, but many are dated or based on dated information. TheU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development points to a study done in 2007 -- before the brunt of the foreclosure crisis hit --which stated that about 3.5 million people, 1.35 million of them children, are likely to experience homelessness in a given year. That study was conducted by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty . \"People lose their jobs. Their monthly household expenses spiral out of control because maybe their car broke down that month, and when you have such a tight budget with high rental costs, there is no room for error. And so that is what really leads families to the shelter door,\" said Mary Cunningham, author of \"Preventing and Ending Homelessness - Next Steps.\" Reflecting on their struggles over the last few years, Sheila calls it \"eye-opening.\" \"It's like they say you never know [someone] until you walk in their shoes, so truly I know now and if I ever get out [of] this situation, I will always give back to people less fortunate than I am because I know their struggles,\" Wash said. School officials in Prince George's County, Maryland, where the two Wash children go to school, say a day doesn't go by without the need to enroll another child as homeless. Denise Ross, supervisor for the school district's Homeless Education Office, said they've been inundated with requests. \"Some of them are embarrassed, some of them are scared, some of them are sad. They're just not sure what's going to happen next,\" Ross said. \"Students who are displaced or homeless students feel that school is a safe haven. They really want to come to school. They really want to attend school.\" For homeless students, Prince George's County Schools offers free transportation to and from school, free breakfast and lunch, help with school supplies and also clothing. \"Either in the shuffle of being evicted or moving from shelter to shelter or place to place, their clothes may not have followed them. Or may have been set out and somebody may have taken them. So they may only have [the] clothes that are on their back. Our intent is always to provide them with at least three complete sets,\" Ross said.

Doctors Without Borders will conduct trials at three treatment centers in Guinea and Liberia, the medical aid agency announced Thursday. One trial will treat infected patients with the antiviral drug brincidofovir at a medical center in the Liberian capital of  Monrovia. In a second trial, patients will get the antiviral drug Favipiravir in the southern town of Gueckedou in Guinea. A  third trial in the Guinean capital of Conakry will focus on giving patients blood transfusions from Ebola survivors, a method recommended by the World Health Organization. There is currently no cure or vaccine for Ebola, which has killed thousands in  Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone -- the three nations most affected. Clinical trials led by three research groups will focus on finding an effective therapy against the disease. \"This is an unprecedented international partnership which represents hope for patients to finally get a real treatment against a disease that today kills between 50 and 80% of those infected,\" said Dr. Annick Antierens of Doctors Without Borders. First trial . While the use of brincidofovir will be a first for Liberia, this is not the first time the drug has been used to fight the virus. The first Ebola patient in  the United States, Thomas Eric Duncan, got brincidofovir at Texas Health Presbyterian, where he was treated after arrival from Liberia in September. He died last month. NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who contracted the virus in Liberia and was airlifted to the United States for treatment, got the drug as well. He was discharged from a Nebraska hospital last month. Second trial . In Guinea, patients will get the same treatment given to Spanish nurse's aide Teresa Romero Ramos, who took Favipiravir . She survived. Blood transfusions . In the Guinean capital, patients will get transfusions from survivors. Blood from survivors, referred to as convalescent serum, is said to have antibodies that can fight the deadly virus. Though unproven, the treatment has provided some promise. \"Studies suggest blood transfusions from survivors might prevent or treat Ebola virus infection in others, but the results of the studies are still difficult to interpret,\" the WHO said. \"It is not known whether antibodies in the plasma of survivors are sufficient to treat or prevent the disease. More research is needed.\" Convalescent serum was used to treat  American aid worker Rick Sacra, who was hospitalized in Omaha and got blood from Kent Brantly, a fellow American who survived Ebola. Both got infected when they were helping patients in Liberia. Fears of an outbreak in Mali . The tests come amid fears that Mali has not combated the deadly virus.  Four people have died of Ebola in Mali, the WHO said. A nurse died at a hospital in the Malian capital of Bamako, the health ministry said Wednesday.  The first victim, a 2-year-old girl, died last month. The nation was optimistic it had beaten the virus, but the new fatalities have raised fears of another outbreak. The hospital in Bamako is under quarantine. The toddler's case is not linked to the new cases, according to the WHO. West Africa tolls . Ebola has killed at least 5,160 people and infected nearly 14,098, mostly in the three nations, the World Health Organization said in its latest report.

{"source": "### Instruction:Give me a one line summary of the story below:\n### Input:(CNN) -- One of the emergency responders at last month's deadly Texas fertilizer plant explosion is now charged with possessing materials for a pipe bomb, a court document states. Authorities on Friday said they are launching a criminal investigation into last month's blast in the town of West, but have not said if the arrest of Bryce Reed is connected. Local sheriff's deputies were called on Tuesday to a residence where they found components for a pipe bomb, according to a criminal complaint affidavit. The officers determined that Reed had given the materials to the resident of that home last month. Among the materials found were a galvanized metal pipe, a fuse, coils of metal ribbon and several bags of chemical powders, the affidavit states. Reed, who was arrested early Friday, is charged with possession of a destructive device. \"At this time authorities will not speculate whether the possession of the unregistered destructive device has any connection to the West fertilizer plant explosion,\" the U.S. attorney's office for the Western District of Texas said in a release. If convicted, Reed would face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Reed spoke last month at a memorial for the victims at Baylor University. The arrest details came as authorities said they conducting a thorough criminal investigation into the April 17 fire and explosion that killed 14 in the small town of West. \"This disaster has severely impacted the community of West, and we want to ensure that no stone goes unturned and that all the facts related to this incident are uncovered,\" DPS Director Steven McCraw said. On Monday, the state fire marshal's office said it ruled out four potential causes: weather, natural causes, anhydrous ammonium, and ammonium nitrate in a rail car. The fire began in the fertilizer and seed building, but authorities still were trying to figure out the exact spot, the fire marshal's office said Monday. The blast happened about 20 minutes after the first report of a fire at the fertilizer facility. It registered on seismographs as a magnitude-2.1 earthquake and could be felt 50 miles away. The explosion damaged numerous homes, a nursing home and the town's high school and middle school, all of which were built within a few hundred feet of the plant. West is about 70 miles south-southwest of Dallas, . Scores of investigators have followed up on scores of leads relating to the explosion. At least 60 investigators have been on site each day and have conducted 411 interviews in trying to determine how the fire started and what caused the explosion. \"The citizens of McLennan County and Texas must have confidence that this incident has been looked at from every angle and professionally handled -- they deserve nothing less,\" McLennan Sheriff Parnell McNamara said. West Fertilizer Co., which operated the facility, had been cited by federal regulators twice since 2006. In 2012, the Transportation Department's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration fined West Fertilizer $5,250 for storing anhydrous ammonia in tanks that lacked the proper warning labels. The agency originally recommended a $10,000 penalty, but it was reduced after the company took corrective action. In 2006, the EPA fined it $2,300 and told the owners to correct problems that included a failure to file a risk management program plan on time. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality also investigated a complaint about the lingering smell of ammonia around the plant the same year.\n### Response :", "target": "NEW: Bryce Reed had the materials to make a pipe bomb .\nNEW: Authorities will not say if the arrest is related to the deadly fertilizer plant blast .\nThe state fire marshal's office has said it ruled out four potential causes .\nThe April 17 fire and blast at West Fertilizer Co. killed 14 people .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?\n### Input:(CNN) -- In August 2008, Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan-American, and two friends from his high school in Queens flew from Newark, New Jersey, to Peshawar, Pakistan, where they hoped to join the Taliban. In Peshawar, the trio met with \"Ahmad,\" an al Qaeda operative who put them in touch with two al Qaeda leaders. Those leaders asked the three from Queens to participate in attacks against the United States. Zazi refused. He wanted to fight the U.S. military in the fields and mountains of his homeland, not to kill American civilians in the streets of his adopted country. So, according to American prosecutors, al Qaeda's leaders brought in someone more persuasive -- someone who could speak to Zazi in his own language, someone who had also grown up on the streets of New York City in the 1990s, a man who had had a meteoric rise in the ranks of al Qaeda over the past decade from camp dishwasher to the leader of the group's operations in the West. His name was Adnan Shukrijumah. Eventually Shukrijumah would be added to the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorists\" list and a $5 million reward would be put on his head. And on Saturday, Shukrijumah was killed in Pakistan by the Pakistani military. Shukrijumah was born in Saudi Arabia in 1975, but his family moved to Trinidad in the '80s and then to Brooklyn in the early '90s. In 1995, Shukrijumah's family left New York for the Fort Lauderdale area in Florida, where he did odd jobs like selling used cars, earning money that he used to pay for his studies in chemistry and computer science at Broward Community College. Some Muslim men in Florida gave Shukrijumah books and videos about the holy wars in Kashmir and Afghanistan, and he was so moved by these stories of holy war that in late 1999 he traveled to Afghanistan to attend an al Qaeda training camp. Around this time, Shukrijumah told his mother that he was opposed to what he considered the excesses of the West, such as alcohol and drug abuse as well as the skimpy clothes that women wore in Florida. In May 2001, he left Florida again, and by June he was back in Afghanistan. Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, Shukrijumah called his mother in Florida, saying, \"Did you hear what happened? They are putting it on the Muslims.\" His mother advised him not to come back to the States, and she said in 2010 he did not contact her again. It was Shukrijumah who, in late 2008, made the pitch to Zazi and his buddies from Queens -- Zarein Ahmedzay, another Afghan-American, and Adis Medujanin, a cab driver of Bosnian descent -- that they could help the cause of holy war best if, instead of fighting alongside the Taliban's tens of thousands of fighters, they went back to the States after their training by al Qaeda's bomb-makers and launched attacks there. At the time that Shukrijumah was making his pitch to the trio from Queens, the CIA drone war in the tribal regions of Pakistan was heating up. It was the last six months of President George W. Bush's second term, and the Bush administration had significantly amped up the drone program. Angered by the CIA drone program, Zazi agreed to return to the States to launch an attack. He also volunteered to be a suicide bomber, as did his two friends. They discussed with Shukrijumah potential targets such as the New York Stock Exchange and Times Square, as well as a Walmart store. Zazi returned to New York in mid-January 2009. He had been living on the Afghan-Pakistan border for five months, during which time he had been in almost continuous contact with members of al Qaeda. He was now ready to launch what al Qaeda's leadership hoped would be the most lethal terrorist attack in the States since 9/11. Luckily, Zazi's plan to blow up bombs in the Manhattan subway around the time of the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks was detected by U.S. intelligence agencies that were monitoring the email account of a known al Qaeda operative in Pakistan who was in touch with Zazi. Zazi and his two friends were arrested before they could carry out the plot. It was Shukrijumah who oversaw this plot. After all, who better to oversee al Qaeda plots to attack the States than someone who had grown up in Brooklyn and Florida? A Pakistani army spokesman said on Twitter on Saturday that Shukrijumah was killed in South Waziristan along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan. The fact that Shukrijumah is now dead makes the United States a little bit safer from al Qaeda's plotting. And the fact that Shukrijumah was killed in a Pakistani military operation is a sign that Pakistan continues to expand its operations against militants based on its border with Afghanistan in a meaningful way, which has long been a demand of the United States. Finally, Shukrijumah's death is indicative of how al Qaeda's core organization that launched the 9/11 attacks continues to dwindle in size and capacity, because almost all of its leaders are now dead or captured. The elimination of almost all of al Qaeda's leaders in Pakistan suggests that the once-global organization may become just another Pakistani-based jihadi group with limited or no ability to operate outside of South Asia.\n### Response:", "target": "Pakistan kills an American al Qaeda commander who was on FBI \"Most Wanted\" list .\nPeter Bergen says the death of Adnan G.

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the central ideas presented?(CNN) -- The Texas House of Representatives approved a measure Wednesday that would place broad new restrictions on abortions in the state. A state Senate committee is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to send its version of the bill to the full Senate. The legislation would ban abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, require abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers, tighten usage guidelines for the drug RU486 and require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing abortion services. The House's move comes two weeks after state Sen. Wendy Davis tried to block the bill with a filibuster, talking for more than 10 hours in an attempt to run out the clock on the legislative session. Gov. Rick Perry called a special session so the legislature could take up the measure again. The measure passed the House on Wednesday with a 98-49 vote after hours of debate over proposed amendments. In Texas, fetal pain factors into abortion debate . Critics said the measure would shut down most abortion clinics in Texas, denying access to many in rural communities, and force women to seek dangerous back alley abortions. Many Democrats, like Rep. Mary Gonzales, felt the motives for the legislation were less than pure. \"Is this bill more about women's health or political futures,\" she asked Tuesday. But for Republicans like Rep. Jason Villalba, the bill's passage was intensely personal. Holding up a sonogram of his 13-week-old son, he voiced his support. \"I will fight, and I will fight, and I will fight to protect my baby,\" he said. Proponents say that the bill is necessary to raise the standard of care for women in Texas and will protect 20-week-old babies at the point that they begin to have the ability to feel pain. On Tuesday, Davis conceded to CNN the abortion legislation was likely to pass this time around. \"It will be very difficult because unfortunately the voices that have been here crying out against this bill are not going to be heard,\" Davis told CNN. \"But I don't think it's the end.

{"source": "### Instruction:Produce an article summary of the following news article:Doc to summarize:\n### Input:Washington (CNN) -- Think of pop-tops, and a soda can might come to mind. But Sister Rosemary Nyirumbe sees pop-tops as a way to help hundreds of women in Gulu, Uganda, start a new life. Nyirumbe sells women's purses made out of the aluminum tabs, and so far she has sold more than 500 purses for about $3,000. All of the proceeds go to the people who made them -- her students at the St. Monica's Girls' Tailoring Center. Eight years ago, Nyirumbe started the school in Gulu to help poor young girls and women caught in the middle of the decades-long Ugandan civil war. Many of the women had become mothers after they were abducted and raped by rebels in the Lord's Resistance Army. Nyirumbe's school feeds and rehabilitates more than 300 mothers and their babies each year. It also provides free medical care and teaches the mothers valuable life skills, such as sewing, cooking and cleaning. The purses are a relatively new endeavor and just one of the many ways her school is helping students who have been deeply traumatized and need money to support themselves. \"I got this idea, and it took me about two weeks to teach myself and my students,\" Nyirumbe said during a recent trip to the U.S. \"It's really changing their lives, because they are paid for what they produce.\" In 2007, Nyirumbe was recognized as a CNN Hero for her efforts with the school. \"It raised a lot of awareness about what we're doing, because after that, it exposed me to many people in the world,\" she said. \"It has really made a lot of people come to understand the importance of supporting us.\" However, the needs are still many. For example, there is no electricity at the school. \"We have a generator which we can use for about two hours, but the cost of fuel is so high that we cannot maintain it,\" she said. \"Uganda is a country which is developing, and technology is available. But in my case, I live in a place where there's no electricity.\" The school is also next to a prison, but Nyirumbe said she saw that as an opportunity, not an obstacle. She said that as she drove by one day, she knew that inside there were people she could help. \"I went to the prison authority and asked them if they would let the women come out, and they told me to put it in writing. I did, and now the children are coming to our center from the prison,\" she said. Nyirumbe, who joined the sisterhood when she was just 15, says that since being named a CNN Hero, she has seen a marked increase in publicity, awareness and trust. Doctors, lawyers and professional athletes from the U.S. now routinely travel to her school. But she gets her most satisfaction from seeing \"these girls working with their heads up. They have their dignity restored, and they can support themselves and they can take care of their children. And they love their children.\" At 54, Nyirumbe is not planning to slow down anytime soon. A second school north of Gulu and close to the border with Sudan is now being built. \"I think I see everything as a kind of plan of God for me, and it gives me the energy, it gives me the joy to be where I am and to work in a difficult situation,\" she said. \"And I think if I was someone always unhappy or ... I was not giving joy to the people, I would not accept to take care of these girls who have suffered a lot.\" She then paused before adding determinedly, \"Yes, I will continue.\" Donations for Nyirumbe's school can be made through the Rural Hospital Relief Fund.\n### Response:", "target": "Sister Rosemary Nyriumbe, a 2007 CNN Hero, is still making a difference in Uganda .\nHer school is rehabilitating women who were abducted and raped during a long civil war .\nOne way the students make money is by the sales of women's purses they make .\nNyirumbe says a second school is now being built close to the Sudan border .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Speaking on a cloudy day at Falcon Stadium, the president compared the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to America's earlier conflicts, particularly World War II. \"Our nation is once again contending with an ideology that seeks to sow anger, hatred and despair: the ideology of Islamic extremism,\" he said. \"In today's struggle, we are once again facing evil men who despise freedom and despise America and aim to subject millions to their violent rule. \"We assumed this obligation before,\" he said, referring to the rebuilding of Germany and Japan after World War II, a conflict that saw the loss of more than 400,000 American lives.

And people across the world have reaped the benefits from that alliance,\" he said. \"Today, we must do the same in Afghanistan and Iraq. ... We'll lay the foundation of peace for generations to come.\" But today's wars differ from those of the past, Bush acknowledged, and not only because of modern technology that allows \"greater precision\" in warfare. \"One challenge is that in the past, in Germany and Japan, the work of rebuilding took place in relative quiet,\" he said. \"Today, we're helping emerging democracies rebuild under fire from terrorist networks and state sponsors of terror. This is a difficult and unprecedented task -- and we're learning as we go.\" The measure of success in war has changed, he said. \"In the past ... there were public surrenders, a signing ceremony on the deck of a battleship, victory parades in American cities. Today, when the war continues after the regime has fallen, the definition of success is more complicated.\" Nonetheless, he said, in Iraq and Afghanistan, there is a clear definition of success: when those countries are rid of al Qaeda, when they are economically viable, when they are democracies that can govern effectively and when they are strong allies on the war on terror. \"These successes will come,\" he told the class. \"And when they do, our nation will have achieved victory, and the American people will be more secure. \"\n### Response :", "target": "President Bush speaks at U.S. Air Force Academy graduation Wednesday .\nBush: \"Only way America could lose the war on terror is if we defeat ourselves\"\nHe compares the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to America's earlier conflicts .\nSuccesses in Iraq and Afghanistan \"will come,\" he told the class .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

One Chinese city thinks it has the answer: It has divided a sidewalk on one of its busiest streets into two lanes -- one for cellphone users and the other for those without. The sidewalk is in the city of Chongqing in southwestern China. Fifty meters long and three meters wide, it has warning signs painted in white on the ground. Long Cheng, a spokesperson for the developer that came up with the idea, said that the sidewalk lanes reminded tourists not to walk while playing with their cellphones. \"It's an unsafe gesture with potential safety hazards,\" she said. The road, known as \"yangrenjie\" or foreigners street, is a popular tourist attraction in the city because of its faux Western architecture and an amusement park. Long said the developers were inspired by a recent experiment in Washington DC and there were no plans yet to roll out the concept elsewhere in the city. Not all pedestrians were sold on the idea, however. \"This kind of sidewalk is not a fundamental solution and could be an indulgence for mobile phone addicts in the long run, in my mind -- and this could even lead to more problems in the future,\" Xing Xing told the China Daily.

{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.(CNN) -- The European Union has barred the import of certain seeds from Egypt after Egyptian fenugreek seeds were linked to deadly outbreaks of E. coli in France and Germany. European officials have also ordered that all seeds imported from one particular Egyptian exporter between 2009 and 2011 be withdrawn from sale, tested and destroyed. The move follows a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report released Tuesday that concludes one lot of fenugreek seeds imported from Egypt and used to produce sprouts is the \"mostly likely common link\" between the outbreaks of E. coli in France and Germany. The import ban, which applies to all EU member states, extends to the end of October. The contamination of the fenugreek seeds \"probably occurred before the seeds left the importer,\" the European Commission cites the EFSA report as saying. That contamination \"reflects a production or distribution process which allowed contamination with fecal material of human and/or animal origin. Where exactly this took place is still an open question,\" the EFSA report said. The EFSA said it was continuing to investigate where the fenugreek seeds from the Egyptian importer may have gone and concludes that the number of EU states that have received \"parts of the suspected lots is much larger than previously known.\" The EFSA report does not rule out the possibility that more than one lot of seeds may be implicated in the outbreaks. \"Tracing back the origins of the E. Coli 0104 contaminations in Germany and France has been a key priority for the EU from day one of the crisis,\" Health and Consumer Commissioner John Dalli said in a statement. The commission would continue to monitor the situation closely and would take additional measures if needed, he said. The recent European outbreaks from a strain of E. coli have led to 48 deaths in Germany and one in Sweden, the EFSA said, with 4,178 cases reported in European Union states, Norway and Switzerland. The outbreak in Germany spread in May, and French authorities reported an outbreak in the Bordeaux region on June 24, the EFSA said. The agency has offered safety advice for consumers. \"As seeds sold for sprouting are often sold as seed mixes and cross-contamination cannot be excluded, it is important that consumers are advised not to grow sprouts for their own consumption, and also not to eat sprouts or sprouted seeds unless they have been cooked thoroughly,\" its statement said. In 2010, the EU imported from Egypt about 49,000 tons of the types of seeds affected by Tuesday's decision, the European Commission said, with a total value of more than 56 million euros ($81 million).

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.(CNN)The former Navy SEAL who says he fired the shot that killed Osama bin Laden says he doesn't care if people believe him. \"The most important thing that I've learned in the last two years is to me it doesn't matter anymore if I am 'The Shooter.' The team got him,\" Robert O'Neill said in an audio interview with freelance journalist Alex Quade, a former CNN correspondent, that aired Friday on CNN's \"AC360.\" \"Regardless of the negativity that comes with it, I don't give a f***. We got him.\" \"AC360\" obtained the audio interview from Quade, who conducted a series of interviews with O'Neill over the past 18 months. The killing of bin Laden will go down in history, O'Neill said. \"But I don't care if I'm 'The Shooter,' and there are people who think I'm not. So whatever.\" The audio interview follows an interview published this week in The Washington Post, in which O'Neill publicly identified himself as the SEAL who killed the leader of al Qaeda in 2011. The 38-year-old O'Neill had previously revealed details of the mission to Esquire magazine. But he was hesitant to attach his name to the account until his identity was linked to the story on a military blog earlier this week without his consent. O'Neill told the Post that other SEAL team members were involved in the raid, including Matt Bissonnette, who detailed the group's experiences in his memoir, \"No Easy Day,\" written under the pseudonym Mark Owen. O'Neill, who had been serving as a SEAL for 15 years at the time of the bin Laden raid, had participated in other missions, but he said he feared this mission would be his most difficult. In the audio interview with Quade, he said the members of SEAL Team Six talked about the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. He and other team members believed they would not return alive from the mission to get bin Laden. \"Well, you have to go pump yourself up to go die. So we would talk about this,\" O'Neill said. \"...(It was a) group of guys who knew time on Earth was up, so you could be honest with each other. And we all accepted and nobody was afraid. It was really cool.\" He also said when he identified himself as the shooter to the families of 9/11 victims, they thanked him for closure. \"He died afraid, and he knew we were there to kill him. And that's closure,\" he said in the audio interview. Did Robert O'Neill really kill bin Laden? O'Neill's move to go public is a controversial one, as it violates an unspoken military rule: Don't seek attention for your service. \"We do not abide willful or selfish disregard for our core values in return for public notoriety or financial gain,\" said an October 31 letter to the Naval Special Warfare ranks from commanding officer B.L. Losey and force Master Sgt. M.L. Margaraci. In the audio interview, O'Neill says he believes some details about the bin Laden mission, such as how he was killed, were no longer classified because they had been repeatedly leaked in the aftermath by high-level officials. \"Once anyone says anything at that level, it's not classified,\" he said. \"...I was told by people that I can't even say I'm a Navy SEAL, so I don't give a f*** what they think.\" Twenty-three SEALs and their interpreter launched the assault on the bin Laden compound just after midnight on the morning of May 2, 2011. They shot and killed bin Laden's two bodyguards, one of bin Laden's sons and the wife of one of the bodyguards. They also wounded two other women. O'Neill has told his story before in a lengthy profile in Esquire in 2013, in which O'Neill was described not with his real name but only as \"The Shooter.\" In the Esquire piece, O'Neill/The Shooter was said to have encountered al Qaeda's leader face-to-face in the top-floor bedroom of the compound in Abbottabad where he had been hiding for more than five years. The Shooter said the al Qaeda leader was standing up and had a gun \"within reach,\" and it was only then that the Shooter fired two shots into bin Laden's forehead, killing him. That account was in conflict with the narrative in \"No Easy Day.\" Another member of the secretive SEAL Team 6, which executed the bin Laden raid, told CNN's Peter Bergen the story of The Shooter as presented in Esquire is false. According to this serving SEAL Team 6 operator, the story is \"complete BS.\" But in the audio interview, O'Neill dismissed the criticism. \"Even now, I mean, there are guys now saying that I am full of s***,\" he said. \"...You only know what you were told unless you were in the room. And unfortunately for me, there was two people in the room, and one of us is dead and that's Osama bin Laden.\" CNN's Slma Shelbayah, Peter Bergen, Anderson Cooper, Jack Gray and Charlie Moore contributed to this report.

Excessive heat warnings have been declared by the National Weather Service in at least 14 states Sunday, most of those in the upper Midwest. Excessive heat watches were in place in Indiana and Kentucky, with heat advisories (the least imminent of the three) in effect for four other states. Several daily temperature records were broken Sunday -- from Alpena, Michigan, south to Miami, Florida. \"This is the hottest it's been for the longest period of time,\" said Emily McNamara from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where the temperatures were expected to hover in the mid-90s through the middle of the week. Prevent heat-related illnesses . The blistering weather won't end, but rather it will move east, once the alerts expire in most cases Wednesday or Thursday. Extreme heat is forecast to bear down on the eastern United States by the end of this week. Jacob Beitlich, a Des Moines, Iowa-based meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said that two factors contribute to make this current heat wave especially dangerous: the lack of a significant drop in temperatures overnight to allow people's bodies to cool down and relatively high humidity, which makes it feel appreciably hotter than the thermostat may indicate. In Iowa, for instance, he noted that the impact of mid-90s temperatures have been compounded by relatively high dew points in the upper 70s and low 80s. These combine to make the heat index -- a meteorological measure for how it feels outside -- spike so that it feels as hot as 126 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the weather service. \"That takes a toll on your body,\" Beitlich explained. \"When it's more humid, it's more difficult to cool down from sweating.\" Gotta Watch: Heat wave solutions . The National Weather Service notes that typically extreme heat is the biggest weather-related killer in the United States, taking about 115 lives each year. That's why it and other government agencies urge people to minimize their time outdoors in periods of extreme heat, drink plenty of fluids, and keep especially close tabs on the elderly and young people. In Missouri, for one, scores of cooling centers have been established in libraries, senior centers, schools and other sites around the state to help deal with continuously high temperatures. At Target Field in Minneapolis, Minnesota Twins supporters stood in long lines to get water from coolers, used spray fans, wrapped wet towels on their head during a Sunday game -- anything to keep cool. \"It is blistering out,\" said one fan, Jeff Ferris. \"Brutal. I've probably lost 10 pounds today -- it's crazy.\" Dehydration and youth sports . While the recent stretch has been particularly difficult, it's all part of what's been a continuously long, hot and in many cases dry summer in numerous locales. The weather service indicates that Oklahoma, for instance, already has had 27 days this year in which the temperature surpassed 100 degrees. Not everyone, though, in the region sweat it out this weekend. McNamara notes that the Wild West Waterpark, where she is aquatic manager, has had \"record-breaking days in terms of attendance\" in recent days, with several thousand flooding in to get wet and beat the heat. \"It's awesome,\" she said. \"You see people coming out having fun. It makes for a fast day.\" CNN's Ted Rowlands and Jacqui Jeras contributed to this report.\n### Response :", "target": "NEW: A Minnesota Twins fan describes the extreme heat in Minneapolis as \"brutal\"\nThe National Weather Service has declared excessive heat warnings for 14 states .\nHigh humidity has driven up heat indices, making it feel as hot as 126 degrees .\nThe extreme heat is forecast to move east by week's end, affecting the East Coast .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Police found Julissa Brisman, 26, unconscious with multiple gunshot wounds on April 14. She later died. Philip Markoff, a pre-med student at Boston University with no criminal record, also was charged with the armed robbery and kidnapping of another victim, Police Commissioner Ed Davis announced Monday evening. Markoff, who was under police surveillance, was arrested earlier in the afternoon after a traffic stop south of the city, police said. Markoff is suspected in the death of New York City resident Julissa Brisman, 26, who was found unconscious with multiple gunshot wounds at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel on April 14. She was transferred to Boston Medical Center, where she died from her injuries shortly afterward. Police said that Brisman, a model, offered massages via Craigslist, a popular online classified ads service. The confrontation between Brisman and her killer seems to have begun as an attempted robbery, police said. \"It appears that there was a struggle between the victim and the suspect in the threshold of the hotel room immediately prior to the shooting,\" the Boston Police Department said in a statement posted on  its Web site. Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blonde man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, said the Boston Police Department, which had asked for the public's help in identifying the man. Police did not release a photo of Markoff on Monday. Four days before Brisman's killing, Markoff allegedly robbed a 29-year-old woman at gunpoint at a Westin Hotel in Boston, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said. A police spokesman would not disclose the details of her Craigslist ad but said she and Brisman were \"involved in similar professions.\" \"This is a compelling case with a myriad of evidence -- with computer evidence being a part of it,\" Conley said, adding that additional search warrants would be executed this week. Markoff's arraignment was set for Tuesday morning at the Boston Municipal Court. It was not immediately clear if he had retained defense counsel. Davis and Conley warned there may be other victims that come forward in the case. \"We would like to make one final pitch to those out there who may have been a victim of robbery at the hands of Philip Markoff, especially those who may have used Craigslist in the manner in which the victim used Craigslist,\" he said. Authorities received more than 150 leads in the case, which Davis credited to the popularity of the Web site. \"The public came forth, they were fascinated by this crime,\" he said, adding, \"I wish we had this level of cooperation in every homicide that occurred.\" Davis said Boston investigators were working with police in Warwick, Rhode Island, in what could be a related case. On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, according to Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, according to McCartney. He said no conclusions could be made, but allowed that the incident \"may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area.\"  Watch police say assailant is perusing Craigslist ads \u00bb .

{"source": "### Instruction: What are the highlights?After months of intense political rumors, China's ruling Communist Party announced Tuesday an official probe into a retired senior leader for suspected \"serious disciplinary violation.\" Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar, was placed under investigation in accordance with Party regulations, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said in a one-line statement without elaborating. Before stepping down in late 2012, Zhou, 71, was one of the nine members that formed the Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body that effectively rules the country of more than 1.3 billion people. Under his watch, the domestic security budget swelled to surpass that of the military in the name of \"maintaining stability,\" as a widening income gap between the rich and the poor as well as growing discontent over official corruption fueled social unrest nationwide. Amid an intensifying anti-corruption campaign launched by President Xi Jinping, many political analysts and ordinary citizens have noted ties between an increasing number of disgraced officials and Zhou in recent months. Zhou himself had been rumored to be under house arrest before Tuesday's announcement. The Xi Jinping cipher: Reformer or a 'dictator'? State media have reported official anti-corruption probes into many of Zhou's family members as well as former associates in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and southwestern Sichuan province -- three places Zhou once ruled. Three of his former senior aides were arrested early this month. If indicted, Zhou would become the highest-ranking official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the People's Republic. \"It's almost certain the he would be put on trial and appear in public,\" said Professor Willy Lam with Chinese University of Hong Kong, a longtime commentator on Chinese politics. \"The important thing is that Xi Jinping has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members -- and in the future he can use this anti-corruption card to thrash his political enemies.\" The news on Zhou came on the heels of the downfall of several former high-ranking officials, including a retired top general of the 2 million-strong People's Liberation Army. Gen. Xu Caihou, a former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, which runs the world's largest standing army, was expelled from the Communist Party and handed over to prosecutors after being found to have accepted bribes, state-run Xinhua news agency reported early this month. Xu was also a member of the Politburo before retiring in 2012. State media have characterized Xu as a big \"military tiger\" caught in the massive anti-graft campaign spearheaded by Xi, who is also the commander-in-chief. Xi banned official extravagance -- from banquets to year-end gifts -- and vowed to target \"tigers and flies\" alike in his fight against corruption. He resolved to spare no one, regardless of position. CCTV recently touted the capture of 35 \"tigers\" since Xi took power less than two years ago. Some 182,000 officials were disciplined in 2013, while courts nationwide tried 23,000 corruption cases, according to the Communist Party's disciplinary commission.

The firefighters took advantage of the lower temperatures at night to make \"backfires\" that helped secure the containment lines, fire management spokesman Marc Peebles said. The work, however, did not change the percentage of the fire that was contained. It remained at 30% on Saturday. The Colby wildfire, as it is called, continued to burn Saturday on about 1,863 acres of foothills of Los Angeles County near Glendora. An illegal campfire apparently ignited the wildfire, and fire officials cited drought conditions as contributing to the blaze. One area resident, Korey Rowe, who moved to Los Angeles just six days, photographed the blaze and firefighting helicopters for a CNN iReport. He woke to the choppers flying over his home and then drove to see the blaze Friday. \"It was my first wildfire,\" said Rowe, 30. \"There was ash raining down all over us. I could feel the heat, it was awesome. The cops had shut the roads down.\" Also Friday, California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency for the state, saying it is facing \"perhaps the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago.\" The Colby fire began before dawn Thursday and allegedly originated with three men camping in the foothills near Glendora, authorities said. The campers were tossing paper into a campfire, and a gust of wind spread embers, authorities said. The three men, all in their early 20s, were arrested on suspicion of recklessly starting a fire, said police Chief Tim Staab of Glendora. One man is from Glendora and another is from Irwindale, he said. The third man's hometown was not known. Bail was set Thursday at $20,000 for each.

{"source": "### Instruction : Can you give me the gist of this text?\n### Input:(CNN) -- Syria has four chemical weapons facilities that it did not previously disclose to the United Nations, a Western diplomat told CNN on Tuesday. The diplomat said Sigrid Kaag, the U.N. special envoy overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical stockpiles, briefed the U.N. Security Council. Three of the sites are research and development facilities and one is a production facility, according to the source. Syria disclosed the information during ongoing meetings between the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and Syrian authorities, Kaag told the council members, according to the source. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power tweeted shortly after: \"Must keep pressure on regime so it doesn't hide (chemical weapons) capability.\" In August 2013, U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters that a team of experts had gathered to go to Syria to investigate reports of chemical weapons. In September 2013, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released the inspectors' report, which says there was \"clear and convincing evidence\" that sarin, a nerve agent developed for chemical warfare, was used in a Damascus attack. Later that month, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution requiring Syria to eliminate its chemical weapons arsenal, and President Bashar al-Assad promised to adhere to the resolution. The following month, Syria began dismantling its chemical weapons program. In July, 600 metric tons of chemical weapons from Syria were transferred to a U.S. ship for destruction in what marked the demise of the last of the country's declared chemical weapons stockpiles. At the time, officials said it was a major milestone. But inspectors have said they couldn't say for sure whether some undeclared weapons were still lurking somewhere in the country. And in August, there were new allegations of chlorine attacks, officials said. After inspectors' findings were detailed in Tuesday's closed-door Security Council briefing, diplomats took to Twitter with statements that echoed accusations aimed at the Syrian government a year ago. \"Witnesses of chlorine gas attacks described them as carried out by helicopters, which only Syrian regime has. All fingers point to Assad,\" Power said. \"Connect the dots: @OPCW sure chlorine used in #Syria, witnesses saw it dropped by helicopters, which only Assad has. Who's responsible? #UNSC,\" the Lithuanian mission to the United Nations, a current member of the Security Council, tweeted. The Syrian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to CNN. Asked about the revelation of additional Syrian chemical weapons facilities, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki pointed to a recent statement from Secretary of State John Kerry, which said the United States was \"gravely concerned\" about the recent reports of chlorine attacks in Syria. \"This finding, coupled with deep concerns regarding the accuracy and completeness of Syria's declaration to the (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons), raises especially troubling concerns that continued chemical attacks on the Syrian people by the regime could occur,\" Kerry said last month.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?\n### Input:Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay will serve three years in prison on his November conviction on money laundering and conspiracy charges, a Texas judge ruled Monday. Judge Pat Priest sentenced DeLay to three years on the conspiracy charge and five years on the money-laundering charge. But the judge will allow DeLay to serve 10 years probation with community service on the laundering charge in lieu of the prison sentence, and the two sentences will be served concurrently. Priest remanded DeLay into custody and set a $10,000 bond pending appeal. Defense attorney Dick DeGuerin left the courthouse quickly after the sentence was announced but he spoke briefly, saying, \"If I told you what I thought, I would get sued. This will not stand.\" Addressing the court prior to the sentencing, DeLay argued that he still doesn't believe he did anything wrong and never did anything for personal gain. \"I always intended to follow the law,\" he said. \"I'm not stupid. Everything I did I had accountants and lawyers telling me what to do and how to follow the letter of the law, even the spirit of the law.\" DeLay was found guilty in November of illegally funneling corporate money to help elect Republican candidates to the Texas legislature. \"Judge, I can't be remorseful for something I don't think I did,\" he said. Earlier, prosecutor Steve Brandt urged the judge to send DeLay to prison, saying the once-powerful Republican showed too much disregard for the law to warrant community service and probation. \"He has shown no remorse, no remorse whatsoever,\" said prosecutor Steve Brandt in his closing arguments. \"The man, according to him, does nothing wrong.\" \"He needs to go to prison, your honor, and he needs to go today.\" \"If he gets probation,\" Brandt said, \"and those people who read the newspaper tomorrow ... will say, 'I told you. He wears a tie, he gets probation.'\" \"I'm going to use a quote from Alexander Hamilton,\" he said. \"'No one is above the law.'\" DeGuerin countered that \"no purpose would be served today by sending Tom DeLay to prison ... He lost it all already.\" DeGuerin stressed DeLay's lifetime of public service, detailing \"his good works for his party, his state and his country,\" and claimed that the prosecution was \"political.\" \"We accept the jury entered its verdict, but we do not accept it,\" he said. \"We will challenge it ... and we have the right.\" DeGuerin said the prosecution was based on the redistricting that took place by the new Texas legislature after the 2002 election -- an effort that changed district lines and cost several Democrats their congressional seats. \"I say that the redistricting that came about ... is what motivated the prosecution to go after him,\" the attorney said, \"because for the first time in decades, the representation represented more of the voters' make-up of Texas.\" At the outset of the trial, DeLay predicted he would be proclaimed innocent and called his conviction \"an abuse of power\" and \"a miscarriage of justice.\" DeLay was found guilty of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering, after being accused of funneling $190,000 to help elect Republicans to the state House and Senate in 2002. He faced a possible maximum prison term of 99 years on the money-laundering charge and 20 years on the conspiracy charge. The prosecution had asked for the full extent of punishment or \"no less than 10 years confinement.\" The defense sought only probation. Two other men facing charges in the case are awaiting trial. DeLay, a conservative Republican, helped Newt Gingrich spearhead the GOP revival in 1994 that won control of the House and Senate in the first midterm election under Democratic President Bill Clinton. While serving as the GOP's congressional whip, DeLay earned the nickname \"The Hammer\" for his strict enforcement of party discipline. In 2004, he was admonished three times by the House ethics committee, which warned him to \"temper\" his future actions to comply with House rules. DeLay stepped aside as majority leader after his 2005 indictment on the money-laundering and conspiracy charges and resigned from Congress the following year. He fought the charges on procedural grounds for several years seeking unsuccessfully to have the trial held in his home county in suburban Houston instead of in the state capital, Austin, and blaming the indictment on a partisan prosecutor. This past summer, DeLay said a separate, long-running federal criminal investigation of his ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff had been closed with no charges. Abramoff pleaded guilty in 2006 to charges of fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy to bribe public officials. Two former DeLay aides who joined Abramoff's lobbying team after leaving Capitol Hill, also pleaded guilty during the wide-ranging influence peddling investigation. The Justice Department has declined to comment on the status of the Abramoff investigation, which also resulted in prison time for Ohio Republican Rep. Bob Ney and for Steven Griles, the No. 2 official in the Interior Department for much of the administration of President George W. Bush. On Monady, DeLay told the judge that his legal bills have topped $10 million. Despite his legal troubles, DeLay found time last year to appear as a short-lived contestant on the television show \"Dancing with the Stars.\" He dropped out of the demanding dance competition due to stress fractures in both feet.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you outline the content?\n### Input:(Wired) -- It's mind-boggling to look at paintings from the 14th and 15th centuries and think that artists like Leonardo da Vinci created such vibrant portraits using nothing more than a free hand and the naked eye -- when just 100 years before, two-point perspective was unknown. If you're David Hockney, who's been a seminal figure in modern painting since the 1960s, you literally can't believe it. Hockney holds nothing against his predecessors, but he does have a theory that some used early optical devices to improve and expand their skills. The idea first occurred to him nearly 14 years ago and became the subject of his book Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the lost techniques of the Old Masters. Hockney's latest show, A Bigger Exhibition, hosted by San Francisco's de Young Museum, looks back on the period since his revelation, highlighting how he's embraced technology ranging from video cameras to iPads, and integrated them into his art. (The exhibition's title is a play on Hockney's best-known painting, A Big Splash.) In 1999, a long-standing and well known fascination with new media led Hockney to his controversial suspicions. Visiting the retrospective of a 19th century French artist, he noticed uncanny technical similarities to drawings that Andy Warhol had traced from slide-projected photographs. Knowing that the tools Warhol had used clearly weren't available in the 1800's, Hockney began researching. It wasn't long before he came across camera lucida, a small prism mounted at the end of a metal arm that enables an artist to refract an image onto their paper. The device received a patent in 1807. Bingo. The discovery was enough to prompt Hockney to expand his investigation, which quickly grew in scope and size. By the end of his study he'd created The Great Wall, a staggering arrangement of pictures organized chronologically from left to right, and geographically from top to bottom, charting of the evolution of western art across time and space. He used the Wall to trace this history of optical aids, identifying 1420 as the trend's likely genesis. Shown publicly for the first time at the de Young, the 8-by-72-foot behemoth is the ultimate testament to Hockney's obsession with technology's influence on fine art. It's obvious that tools like camera lucida made creating realistic artwork easier. But Hockney's broader concern, which he's explored extensively throughout his career, is how technology has allowed artists to experiment with new perspectives, and thus create new ways of considering the world around them. Where Jan van Eyck might have used convex mirrors to create a larger field of view on his canvas, Hockney turns to a modern equivalent: video cameras. Tucked among the rows of hanging paintings and sketches, four large sets of nine LED screens roll footage of the same country road, each in one of the four seasons. To make the piece, titled Woldgate Woods, Hockney mounted nine cameras on an SUV and while a studio assistant drove, he directed another who controlled each shot individually. The result is a video collage that's synchronized in timing, but visually unaligned -- a choice he hoped would challenge the viewer's understanding of perspective, encouraging them to explore each screen and become an active participant in the work. Unsurprisingly, you can find more evidence of technological inspiration all over A Bigger Exhibition. Walking through the seemingly endless space devoted to the exhibit -- the largest in the museum's history -- it's seemingly in more places than not. From towering 12-foot-tall prints of iPad drawings to rolling flat screens depicting each of his digital brushstrokes, Hockney's eye has remained steady while his tools have changed -- making you wonder what will be next in his arsenal.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?\n### Input:(CNN) -- It makes its World Cup debut in Brazil later this year and is already being used by the English Premier League, but the head of European football remains resistant to the introduction of goal-line technology (GLT) for Europe's top competitions. The technology allows referees to make almost instant decisions on awarding goals if the ball has crossed the line. However, UEFA president Michel Platini advocates using extra officials behind the goal, a method used in the Champions League, Europa League and Italy's top division. The Frenchman, who won the European Championships with his country in 1984, prefers UEFA to invest in grassroots football and develop young players rather than spend millions of dollars on installing GLT in stadia. \"I prefer that we have more referees to see if there is a penalty foul and if the ball is going over the line,\" Platini told CNN. \"We don't need perfect camera to see the ball. \"For the Champions League, it's too expensive,\" added Platini, who despite his philosophical opposition to GLT, admitted it could be used during Euro 2016 if that was the consensus of UEFA's executive and referee committees, set to be held in France. Estimating that GLT woud costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac52 million to use in Champions League matches, Platini said: \"I prefer to give these millions of euros to grassroots, to the young players in football, to some infrastructures so they can play football.\" England's top flight adopted GLT for the first time at the start of the 2013-14 season, while the Dutch Eredivisie also uses the technology. Germany's top two divisions will make a decision on whether to use GLT for the 2014-15 campaign before the end of the current season. Bayer Leverkusen's \"ghost goal\" against Hoffenheim in October, when Stefan Kiessling's header went into goal through a hole in the side of the net, illustrated the mistakes that can be made when techonology isn't used. But Platini insisted the example of Italy shows how using more officials can reduce refereeing errors. \"If you want to make a point about five referees, you have to go to Italy because it's been implemented for two years and is working very well,\" he added. \"Thirty five national associations are using the five referees in the world. \"But in Africa, there is only one referee. They don't have the money to afford GLT. There is no money. It's easier to have five referees that you don't pay.\" Platini's homeland will host an expanded European Championships in 2016 -- with 24 teams set to compete compared to 16 in 2012 -- before the tournament changes format ahead of the 2020 edition. Rather than one single country hosting Euro 2020, it will be played across 13 different European cities with the venues set to be announced following a vote in September. Blog: Can football change the world? The pan-European format is Platini's way of marking the 60th \"birthday\" of the tournament and the former Juventus player wants to see Turkey host the final. \"Turkey lost against my country 6-5 (in the vote for Euro 2016) and it is a long time that they have been bidding for some things,\" added Platini. \"They bid for the Euros, they bid for the Olympic Games and I think in the end it will be a beautiful festival for one week with the semifinal in a big country, a beautiful country ... like Istanbul,\" said Platini, referring to the Turkish city. Critics have argued the expansion of teams in the Euros will dilute the quality of the competition, but Platini dismissed those fears. \"I am a man of football, I never will propose to the national association something which is not good for the football,\" he said. \"Never. \"I have to receive the feedback of the fifty-four national associations. Fifty-two were in favor, two were not in favor: Germany and England, but they say we move with the majority. \"I think 24 teams in Europe are good (enough) to win. That means that the quality of the football is not a problem. \"I have to take care about what is good for the football and I only do it for the football. And to me, it was good for the football to extend to 24.\" Platini has been head of UEFA since 2007 and a bid by him for the presidency of FIFA, football's global governing body, has been mooted. The current FIFA president Sepp Blatter has been in the position since 1998 and he had announced his intention to step down from the role ahead of a presidential election in 2015. But he has since said he will reverse that decision if the FIFA members ask him to remain. Platini, a FIFA vice president, was tight-lipped on whether he will be running against Blatter and his fellow Frenchman Jerome Champagne, who announced his intention to run for the presidency in January. \"I didn't think about that a lot because I am very busy and it's so far, one year from now and we don't know what could be,\" said Platini. \"I have to speak with the national association of Europe, I have to travel and I don't take the time to think about that. \"I am working here. We have many projects ... After this work, perhaps I will think about FIFA ... perhaps I don't know.\"\n### Response:", "target": "Michel Platini reiterates his preference for extra officials over technology in football .\nUEFA president says the cost of installing goal-line technology is prohibitive .\nGLT was introduced in the English Premier League at the start of the 2013-14 season .\nPlatini defends UEFA's decision to expand the European Championships to 24 teams .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

So walking up to them you really have just a minute -- if even that -- to say 'yo, this is what I've got,'\" he adds. \"I had instances where people thought I was selling hot items -- 'this dude out here man, he's got some stolen stuff.'\" Read this: Africa's first design museum . But after a year of frequenting celeb hotspots, exhausting his savings in the process, Aire's big break finally came following an L.A.-based encounter with Gary Payton, the NBA star playing for the Seattle Supersonics at the time. \"I was just hanging out at a hotel waiting for him because I knew he was going to be there,\" remembers Aire. \"And when he came down, the press rush that he had, he would have been justified in saying, 'hey man get out of my way.\" Instead, Payton invited Aire to go later that year to a charity event in Miami and show him his creations. There was only one problem: Aire had no money. Undeterred, Aire decided to max out his credit card and buy an airline ticket to Miami, even though he couldn't afford a return flight to L.A. But when he got to Florida, Payton was so impressed with his designs that he immediately placed a $50,000 order, buying a platinum basketball pendant for himself and other jewelry for his friends. \"That sale transformed my life,\" says Aire. \"Not only did I pay for the flight ticket, I had enough to start building and doing a bunch of my own collection.\" 'Leap of faith' The son of a successful Nigerian businessman, Aire grew up in the West African country's Ivue Uromi region. His father wanted him to go into the family oil business, but instead Aire left Nigeria aged 18 to go to college in the United States. But while working on getting his education, Aire had also to find a way of supporting himself. His first job was flipping burgers in a fast-food restaurant overnight. Read this: Tribal beauty of vanishing life . \"I would work from 10 pm to 6 am in the morning and then I'll go home, get a couple of hours nap and then go to school at nine,\" recalls Aire. \"I was at school from 9 until about 4 pm -- and then I went home, got ready and repeated that again, five days a week.\" After graduating from college, Aire tried his luck briefly as an actor and singer, before making his foray into jewelry with the help of a friend whose father was a jeweler. Starting from the bottom, Aire worked his way up, learning the craft and understanding everything about gold, diamonds and other colored gem stones. After six years of apprenticing under his friend's father, Aire had managed to save $5,000. He then decided it was time to strike out on his own and form his own company. \"It was a leap of faith and I took that leap of faith,\" says Aire. \"I was very confident in my faith because I believe whatever it is that puts the inspiration in your mind has within it its own fulfillment.\" 'Massive wealth' Since then, Aire has managed to build a thriving company whose A-list clientele is a roll call of cinema and music superstars. In 2004, Aire made fashion history when he became the first jeweler to stage a runway show at New York Fashion Week. His sparkling creations include a diamond encrusted cuff -- priced at $1.7 million -- and a $500,000 diamond-coated guitar for hip-hop artist Wyclef Jean. But even though he mixes with the rich and famous, Aire has not forgotten where he came from. He frequently visits Nigeria and is optimistic about the future of both his country and his continent. \"I think there is going to be a time when Africa, starting with Nigeria, becomes the envy of luxury market,\" he says. \"There's massive wealth here but the Western impression of Africa has always been a country of people in need of charity, in need of aid, but Africa really is the last frontier.\" Aire also believes that people in the continent should support local designers and luxury brands, which in turn can speed up the growth of African businesses. \"We have to embrace our own so that the next Louis Vuitton or Chanel comes out of Africa. So we are positioning ourselves to be that breakout brand from Africa.\"\n### Response :", "target": "Chris Aire is a famous jeweler whose A-list clients include movie and music stars .\nBorn and raised in Nigeria, Aire moved to the U.S. at a young age to follow his dreams .\nHis sparkling creations have earned him the title, \"King of Bling\"\nAire urges people in Africa to support their local designers and luxury brands .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction :How would you briefly describe the text?\n### Input:(CNN) -- Maybe marriage to Kate Winslet isn't all that bad. Maya Rudolph and John Krasinski star as a couple on the road in the comedy \"Away We Go.\" After cruelly dissecting marital malaise in \"American Beauty\" and again, just six months ago, in \"Revolutionary Road,\" Winslet's husband Sam Mendes takes a slightly more optimistic view of family life in the edgy comedy \"Away We Go.\" Not that he's offering a whole-hearted endorsement of the institution. Burt and Verona (John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph) aren't legally bound -- she staunchly resists his repeated proposals -- but nevertheless they're a couple about to go nuclear: She's six months pregnant. He sells insurance to insurance companies. She's an illustrator with a lucrative line in anatomical drawings. Nevertheless, they're struggling to make ends meet. \"Are we losers?\" wonders Verona (only she uses a more colorful expression). \"We have cardboard windows... I think we must be.\" Insomuch as they have a plan at all, it hinges on the support they're expecting from Burt's doting parents. So it's a nasty wake-up call when Jerry and Gloria (Jeff Daniels and Catherine O'Hara) announce they're taking off for a new life in Belgium -- yes, even before the baby's out. There is a silver lining: Realizing they no longer have any reason to stay, Burt and Verona decide to widen their horizons. They could move to Arizona where Verona's sister lives. Burt has a job prospect in Madison, Wisconsin. Or they have college friends in Montreal. Their destiny awaits them, all they have to do is go out and find it. And away they go. Although the couple racks up a good few miles in their search for home, the movie doesn't betray much interest in location. Arizona is hot and arid. In Montreal they pour gravy on French fries. Don't expect cultural insights. It's never explained how these stragglers can afford such speculative wandering, and when they do find their dream home it's mystifying that it hasn't occurred to them before. Still, the movie's loose-limbed, spontaneous quality is a good part of its appeal, and a refreshing change of pace from other movies by Mendes, whose artfully designed compositions often seem self-conscious and painfully detached. In keeping with Indie-wood's vogue for shuffling snide satire and sentimentality (see \"Juno\" and \"Little Miss Sunshine\"), \"Away We Go\" presents its trepidatious travelers with half a dozen starkly contrasted parental figures, including Allison Janney's monstrously vulgar alcoholic, Maggie Gyllenhaal's radical earth-mother (who has shortened her name to \"LN\"), and Paul Schneider as Burt's rawly dumped brother, who wonders aloud if it would be wrong to tell his daughter her mom has been murdered. There's a level of bile here that some audiences may find alienating -- I can't see it being a big hit in Phoenix -- but Dave Eggers' and Vendela Vida's writing is a cut above the average, and it's performed with gusto. They may not be the most dynamic duo to hit the road, but the relationship between Burt and Verona feels touchingly true. Burt is a boy still trying on manhood for size (with a beard for extra emphasis), and though we've seen Krasinski do this before, he seems to have fine-tuned the performance to the point where he could very happily play it for the next two decades. Unlike his character, he's an actor who has found himself. Maya Rudolph is the joy of this picture. Give or take her role in Altman's \"Prairie Home Companion,\" the \"Saturday Night Live\" star hasn't made much impact in movies before now. With her frazzled, freckled face, she's not the glamour girl who would normally be shoe-horned into the romantic lead, but she seizes her chance and runs with it. Mendes brings out a more thoughtful and nuanced presence than the brittle comedienne, and Rudolph makes you consider how rarely we see a real woman at the center of things. Even her occasional tentativeness works for the part. Verona is so fresh and alert, she can't help but doubt herself as they trail from one family disaster to the next and wonder what kind of parents they are going to make. It's an uneven picture about the bumps in the road, and not immune to the odd dramatic shortcut or jocular cheap shot. But it does catch an anxiety that will be acutely familiar to anyone contemplating imminent parenthood, and -- in a beautifully judged cameo by Melanie Lynskey -- the deep anguish of someone who has had that prospect snatched away. More often than not, and where it really counts, \"Away We Go\" hits home. \"Away We Go\" is rated R and runs 98 minutes.

It's now safe for retailers and carriers to start dropping prices on 2011 and early 2012 smartphone inventory, and that's great news for those looking for a good deal. Since CES has ended, a number of smartphones are now available at very affordable prices. You'd be safe, nay, smart to pick up one of these options if you're looking to make the big switch from a feature phone to a smart device, or perhaps you recently bore witness to the death of your Droid in a wave of spilled beer. If you're itching to try a Windows Phone for the first time, you're in luck. The Nokia Lumia 710 went on sale January 11 for a budget-friendly $50, and is now available for only a penny from Costco, with the purchase of a T-Mobile data plan (which can be had for as cheap as $50 a month). The 3.7-inch, more spec-ed out Lumia 800 hasn't had a U.S. launch date announced yet, and the new 4.3-inch Lumia 900 will land sometime \"in the coming months,\" representatives said. Motorola dropped the price of its ultra-thin 16GB Droid Razr from $300 to $200, with contract from Verizon. The cheaper price tag dumps the 16GB microSD that previously came bundled with the phone, but if you still need that extra storage, you can pick up your own microSD for around $10. Why the price cut on a phone that just launched in November? In Motorola's case, it's time to make room for the new kid in town, the Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, which will be available starting January 26. It's essentially the same phone, only the Maxx has way better battery life. The Samsung Infuse 4G, which launched this summer with a brilliant 4.5-inch Super AMOLED Plus screen, is on sale at AT&T for a mere penny through January 24. And Apple's iPhone 3GS is always just 99 cents (with contract) on AT&T. At Verizon, the Droid Pro and Droid 3 are also on sale, priced at $0 and $100, respectively. With the Sony Xperia S rumored to arrive January 30, it wouldn't be surprising if prices on 2011 Sony handset prices start dropping soon. If you're in the market for a new smartphone, and none of these models tickle your fancy, keep your eyes open: There will definitely be more smartphone steals over the next few weeks as 2012 smartphone models start landing on store shelves.

The teen had left home, moving from one friend's couch to another, and now finally felt like he found a place where he belonged. \"I went to the gym and worked out, and worked out my stuff,\" he says. \"That was kind of my safe haven.\" After taking his first class and leaving with a compliment from the instructor, McCullough was hooked. \"It built self-confidence,\" he recalls. \"At the end of the day, I felt great about it.\" Life was difficult at times for McCullough and his seven siblings who were raised by a single mother. Constantly relocating, he remembers how other kids were not always welcoming when the family moved to a new neighborhood. \"I dealt with bullying growing up as a kid because I was always the new guy at the school,\" he says. By the time he reached high school, a new challenge would shape his future. \"Going to a school with a lot of gangs at one point was kind of one of the things that got me to start and think, 'If I learned how to fight really well, people won't want to bother me at all,' \" he says. McCullough, known to his fans as \"the Razor,\" didn't just learn to fight. He went on to become a World Extreme Cagefighting and five-time United World Muay Thai Association champion, making a successful career taking down opponents in the ring. From a childhood with such challenges, McCullough found both a passion and an occupation. \"I found sports.  I found mixed martial arts; it was like therapy,\" he says. Now McCullough, together with LA Boxing, said he wants other children who face bullying to have the same opportunity. \"I would like to share with other kids that maybe if they are going through issues of being bullied, or they are a bully, it's a place that they can go to to work that stuff out,\" he says.

The Seattle Police Department announced on its Twitter feed that officers will attend the city's Hempfest to hand out Doritos and literature explaining the new rules surrounding recreational marijuana use in the state. Minor marijuana possession has been the police department's lowest priority since 2003, but voters last year cast ballots to make recreational use legal. Before Seattle residents start farming ganja on their stoops, the police want to make a few things clear (such as, you can't grow marijuana on your stoop yet). \"Yes, we will be @seattlehempfest.

Initiative 502 states that beginning December 6 residents over 21 years old may possess up to an ounce of pot for personal use. There are also guidelines for the possession of oils and edibles. Hempfest, which begins Friday and runs through Sunday, says its goal is \"to educate the public on the myriad of potential benefits offered by the cannabis plant, including the medicinal, industrial, agricultural, economic, environmental, and other benefits and applications.\" The Wednesday tweet set off a witty back-and-forth with residents who seem charmed by the police department's light-hearted means of educating the public on a serious matter.

{"source": "### Instruction:Read the following passage and summarize it.(CNN) -- The prominent man had an altercation with his wife at a hotel. He beat her up. There's even a recording of it. And what happened? A plea deal so generous that the abuser's arrest record will be expunged -- totally clean, as if the whole thing had never happened -- if he receives some counseling in the next few months. Ray Rice? Yes. But Rice's case is strikingly similar to that of Mark Fuller, a sitting federal judge in Alabama. On August 9, Fuller's wife called 911 from a hotel room in Atlanta, according to news reports. The woman identified as Kelli Fuller said her drunk husband was assaulting her. \"He's beating on me. Please help me,\" she said. About a minute into the call, as dispatchers summon help, Kelli Fuller is heard saying \"I hate you, I hate you.\" A male voice responds: \"I hate you too,\" followed by dull noises in the background. According to police, Kelli Fuller had cuts to her mouth and forehead and she told them her husband had thrown her to the ground, pulled her hair and kicked her after she confronted him over an alleged affair with a law clerk. Last week, the whole matter was swept discreetly under the rug. Mark Fuller accepted \"pretrial diversion\" offered by Atlanta prosecutors. Under the deal, the judge has to have a drug and alcohol evaluation -- which, according to his lawyer, he doesn't need. \"He doesn't have a drug or alcohol problem and never has,\" Barry Ragsdale, Fuller's attorney, told al.com. Then, Fuller will have to undergo a once-a-week family and domestic violence program for 24 weeks. The judge can undergo that counseling at a location close to home in Alabama. What happens after Fuller completes counseling? He plans to return to the bench, to pass judgment on others. As Fuller put it, \"I also look forward to ... returning to full, active status in the Middle District of Alabama.\" (His cases have been temporarily reassigned. Taxpayers are paying him his full salary in the meantime.) The parallels between the Rice and Fuller cases extend further. In both cases, the couples stayed together. After Ray beat his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer, unconscious in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the couple married. Janay Rice attended the July meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that led to his appallingly lenient two-game suspension from the Baltimore Ravens. NFL toughens domestic violence policy with six-game bans . After TMZ released the video of the elevator assault, Janay Rice released a statement of support for her husband, on Instagram. \"To take something away from the man I love that he has worked for all his life just to gain ratings is horrific,\" she wrote, \"If your intentions were to hurt us, embarrass us, make us feel alone, take our happiness away, you've succeeded on so many levels. Just know we will continue to grow & show the world what love is.\" Fuller is also attempting, apparently successfully, to repair the breach with his wife. \"This incident has been very embarrassing to me, my family, friends and the court,\" he said in his statement, \"I deeply regret this incident and look forward to working to resolve these difficulties with my family, where they should be resolved.\" Consider that last line: \"my family, where they should be resolved.\" This is precisely wrong, and it contributes to a fundamental misunderstanding about domestic violence. When husbands beat up their wives, that is not a matter that should be resolved within the family. It is a crime to be resolved by the legal system. In cases of domestic violence, the question is often raised whether the victim will \"press charges.\" But it's not victims who press charges in this country, it's the state. Ray Rice video prompts stories of #WhyIStayed, #WhyILeft . It's not up to victims to decide whether their husbands should be prosecuted. Abusers damage the community, not just the women they assault. Whether the Rices and Fullers stay married is their business; but whether Ray Rice and Judge Mark Fuller committed crimes should be a question for prosecutors, and ultimately, juries to decide. Unfortunately, it looks like the prosecutors failed in Atlantic City and Atlanta. The sweet deals for these two prominent defendants cannot be undone; the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution forbids it. All the rest of us can do is hope that the next prominent man who beats up his wife doesn't get off as easy.\n### Response:", "target": "Jeffrey Toobin: Ray Rice case mirrors Alabama judge's case; both got plea deals .\nHe says audio of Judge Mark Fuller documents beating; cops say wife had injuries .\nFuller said issue should be resolved within family.

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.\n### Input:(CNN) -- The retro, rounded TV icon was one of the first to grace the iPhone's screen when the device was released in 2007. Now, for the first time, new iPhones will no longer include the YouTube app by default. But YouTube has already whipped up a replacement. On Tuesday, YouTube released its own app for the iPhone. The release comes just one month after Apple publicly confirmed it would no longer include the popular video-site's app on the upcoming version of its mobile operating system, iOS 6. Being a pre-installed, native app on iPhones and iPads has given YouTube instant access to a fast-growing segment of users -- YouTube gets 1 billion mobile views each day across all platforms, and mobile now makes up 25% of all YouTube views. Check out the world's hottest smartphones . But the deal with Apple has not been without its drawbacks. Because the app was built by Apple and baked into the iOS mobile operating system, YouTube had limited control over what it could change and control in the app. Perhaps most importantly, it couldn't show videos with ads because Apple didn't allow it. This new app gives control back to YouTube, but at a cost. To avoid hemorrhaging iPhone users who upgrade to iOS 6, or who buy a new phone with the new operating system pre-installed, the company must convince iPhone owners to stick with YouTube either by downloading the new app or visiting the mobile version of YouTube.com. How smartphones make us superhuman . When the news of Apple dropping the YouTube app came out in August, it was seen as the latest sign of strife between Apple and Google, which owns YouTube. In June, Apple announced it would no longer use Google Maps to power the iPhone and iPad's Maps app, and Apple has been taking on makers of Android-powered smartphones in courts around the world over patent disputes. The removal of YouTube was considered the latest attempt by Apple to extricate itself from Google's products and services. YouTube is playing down the adversarial plot line. \"Apple and us have been working very closely on this one,\" Andrey Doronichev, YouTube's lead mobile product manager, told CNN. \"[This] was the right thing to do from both companies' standpoint. User experience is so much better.\" The news wasn't a complete surprise to YouTube -- Doronichev said his team spent \"months\" working on the app, which means they began before the split became public. Doronichev gave us a tour of the app, which is available for free in the App Store as of Tuesday. The app can be downloaded on iPhones running iOS 4.3 or later. Visually, the new interface is vast improvement over the old version, which had begun to look dated after years of minimal updates. The design has been overhauled and now looks much more like the Android YouTube app, with a hidden navigation panel on the left and a number of new discovery and sharing options. Thanks to the unblocking of videos with ads, the new app has access to \"tens of thousands\" of videos that weren't available in the old app, such as official music videos. The search tool has features familiar to users of other Google iOS apps, including auto-suggestions and voice searches. The app is more than just a repackaged take on the mobile site, and has features not possible on that HTML 5 version of YouTube, including overlays that can be used to show close captioned videos. The most welcome new feature for multi-taskers is in-page playback. You can continuously watch a video in vertical orientation while reading the video description, leaving comments, giving the video a thumbs up or down, and checking out a list of suggested videos. The video even keeps playing when you bring up the navigation menu. The YouTube team hopes these improvements will push iPhone users to do something they haven't had to do before for YouTube: download the app from Apple's App Store. The separation with Apple may decrease the number of iPhone users for a time, but it has made a vastly improved YouTube app possible. And because it is now offered through the app store, the company can continue to offer updates and roll out new features at a much faster pace. The announcement comes just one day before a much-anticipated Apple press conference, at which that company is expected to unveil its latest iPhone.\n### Response : ", "target": "Apple will no longer include a YouTube app by default in new versions of its mobile operating system .\nYouTube has released a new iPhone app which has a new design and can play videos with ads .\nWhile it may temporarily lose users, YouTube gains back control over its apps design and features .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?The gateway to Japan's capital, Tokyo Station, is celebrating its centennial this month -- and it's never looked better. The starting point of the country's railway network, travelers in Japan are likely to pass through this landmark at least once. Situated in the city's historic and political center, Tokyo Station is a destination in its own right. Here are 10 ways it's earned its stripes as a protected cultural landmark. Big numbers . Tokyo Station is an impressive 1,000-feet long (304 meters). It's the busiest station in Japan in terms of number of trains per day (more than 3,000); 350,000 passengers pass through its turnstiles on a daily basis. The station also reportedly earns more revenue than any other station in Japan. It has 14 lines, including the Tokaido Shinkansen, the most heavily traveled high-speed rail route in the world. Architectural marvel . City planners completed a five-year, $625 million renovation of Tokyo Station in 2012. At its heart is the red brick Marunouchi Building, featuring reconstructions of two roof domes that were were destroyed in World War II bombings. Its European facade is one of the few architectural remnants of Tokyo's past, and symbolizes the country's modernization. Eight zodiacal symbols are featured on the interior of the octagonal domes, representing points on a compass (the tiger, for instance, points northeast). Some say the Marunouchi Building was designed to look like Amsterdam Centraal railway station. Though there's little evidence to support this, Tokyo does have sister-station agreements with its Dutch lookalike, and also Grand Central Terminal in New York. Secret tunnels . Urban myth or reality? A subterranean network is rumored to exist in downtown Tokyo, linking important government buildings. The oldest of these is a passage connecting Tokyo Station with the Central Post Office, whose original 1930s veneer was restored in the 2012 makeover. From Tokyo Station, passengers can access six neighboring stations via underground walkways, with one jaunt being more than two kilometers. Many people believe this labyrinthine network was planned as a bomb shelter. Nowadays, with natural disasters a more prevalent worry, Tokyo Station is one of the safest places to be when the Earth rumbles, as the entire station is protected by a seismic isolation structure. Multilingual tourism hub . Rail company JR East operates a travel service center at Marunouchi's north exit offering currency exchange, a luggage storage counter (7:30 a.m.-8:30 p.m.) and even a porter service for the first-class set. Free Wi-Fi is available (a precious commodity in Tokyo), as well as PCs for visitors. In the adjacent JP Tower skyscraper, which houses the renovated Central Post Office, Tokyo City is a tourism resource with walls of brochures in various languages, and staff who can help with all travel needs. The post office upstairs is open all year, with 24-hour postage and foreign-card-friendly ATMs. Assassination attempts . Murder, intrigue, politics ... Tokyo Station has witnessed two assassination attempts on Japanese prime ministers. In 1921, Takashi Hara was stabbed to death by an ultra-conservative railway employee. Hara was Japan's first Christian prime minister, and the first commoner to hold the office. Nine years later, Osachi Hamaguchi befell a similar fate, only he was shot. He didn't die immediately, succumbing to wounds the following year. Both prime ministers are memorialized with plaques in the station. Tokyo Station gallery . When this museum reopened in 2012, the goal was to create \"a small but real gallery.\" Today, visitors can take in exhibits showing contemporary art, or on themes related to railways, architecture and design. More than 2.3 million visitors have passed through since the gallery's opening in 1988. Purchases of JR train tickets help support this small but real museum. Illumination . Holiday light-ups are standard fare for the neon capital. The GranRoof facility near the Yaesu exit hosts this year's \"Tokyo Colors,\" (January 12-February 14), an interactive wonder where lights and music change based on weather conditions and visitor numbers. There's also Tokyo Michi Terrace, an illumination projected on station buildings that takes a \"Memorial Light-up/Taisho Period (1912-1926) Romance\" theme, in honor of the station's birthday. Street of noodles . No Tokyo discussion would be complete without food. In the station you can wander through Kitchen Street, or for slurpier, cheaper meals, Tokyo Ramen Street. Both are located at the station's Yaesu exit; neither is a true outdoor road. Some of Tokyo's most acclaimed ramen joints have set up shop here, including Rokurinsha, famous for its tsukemen (dipping-style noodles). It's best to arrive for breakfast from 7:30-10 a.m. to avoid the crowds. Yes, ramen for breakfast is a thing in Tokyo. For more conventional morning eats, there's New York outposts Bubby's or Dean and Deluca. Or, passengers can pick up an ekiben (bento lunch box) on their dash to the bullet train. Souvenir heaven . It's possible to spend a lot of money, and time, at Tokyo Station. Fans of Hello Kitty, Moomins and Pokemon should swing by Tokyo Character Street (again, also not a real street) for take-home trinkets from some 15 shops. For edible gifts, plenty of themed candies and the like are available, such as Tokyo Terminal Cookies or Brick Bread. And let's not forget Tokyo Banana, the Twinkie's long lost cousin that has no known relation to the city yet is wildly popular (and pretty tasty). Centenarian hotel . Tokyo Station Hotel celebrates its 100-year anniversary in 2015. The swanky, European-style building was a social hub after the Great Hanshin Earthquake, as Tokyo Station miraculously evaded any damage. Political elite still gather here in the afternoons. Room rates start at around \u00a537,000 ($310).\n### Response:", "target": "Japan's historic Tokyo Station turns 100 years old this month .\nTokyo terminus is the busiest station in Japan with the most revenue among all stations .\nUnder Tokyo lies a labyrinth of secret tunnels and the oldest connects the station to the Central Post Office .\nTwo assassination attempts on Japanese prime ministers have taken place in the station .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction: Could you highlight the primary messages?(CNN) -- For years, bloggers and other netizens have repeated: \"A link is not an endorsement.\" Now it appears that we have to add, \"a 'like, 'follow' or 'retweet' is not an endorsement, either.\" That's the only way to respond to the wave of breathless news stories and fancy web tools claiming to divine all kinds of correlations between Twitter buzz or Facebook followers and how the GOP presidential candidates will fare in the primaries. The worst of the new wave is The Washington Post's new MentionMachine tool \"that monitors Twitter and media across the Web for political candidate mentions, revealing trends and spikes that show where the conversation is and why.\" It claims that \"growth in the numbers of legitimate followers or a high recurrence of retweets are both indicative of growing grass-roots support.\" Groan. Actually, growth in followers or high numbers of retweets are just an indication of notoriety or celebrity. Saying simple, stupid things that lots of people want to tell their peers about can get you tons of followers and retweets. But it doesn't mean anything definitive about grass-roots support. Otherwise, right now we'd be talking about Herman Cain's amazing victory in Iowa. (Need I remind you of when he was getting headlines topping the Facebook \"buzz\" charts) These are empty information calories, to borrow a phrase from Clay Johnson's timely new book, The Information Diet. Eat them at your own risk, for they can make you really dumb. This isn't to say that campaigns should ignore social media, or that efforts by voters to influence the election by organizing online are pointless. But just because you can count something and chart it doesn't mean you've proven anything. Take, for example, Newt Gingrich's 1.4 million Twitter followers. On Huffington Post, Alan Rosenblatt demolishes the notion that this means he's popular among Republicans. Half of those accounts aren't in the United States. And half of all Twitter accounts aren't even active. Newt's numbers are a sign of online longevity and notoriety, not much more. Rick Santorum's late surge in Iowa should also put the mania for tracking online buzz into perspective. All of last year, he trailed the pack online. Meanwhile, he worked Iowa the old-fashioned way and did his best to tap into a social network that is more locally rooted than anything Facebook or Twitter has to offer. That is, the evangelical church. As the other candidates with a claim on that community started to fall away, Santorum's fortunes started to rise. And then in late December he got really lucky, sidestepping the negative attention and negative advertising that battered some of the other top-tier candidates while peaking at just the right time. Now the issue isn't how many new followers Santorum may get online, but how well he engages them and converts these low-level indications of interest into money, volunteers and votes. So far, the tidings aren't great. As my colleagues Sarah Lai Stirland and Nick Judd pointed out yesterday, Santorum's website wasn't quite up to the task of handling the burst of traffic he earned Tuesday night, potentially costing him millions in overnight donations. Nor does his site offer supporters a way to self-organize, the way My.BarackObama.com or MyMitt.com invites supporters to start their own profile pages or set up their own house parties and fundraisers. (And I haven't even mentioned the Santorum campaign's failure to successfully address his \"Google problem,\" which Search Engine Land's Danny Sullivan dissects at great length today.) Online politics is complicated and requires a level of technological literacy that most people, reporters included, simply lack. So as you encounter breathless headlines about the role of social media in the 2012 election, or how the race is going to be won or lost on Facebook or Twitter or whatever, just remember this: a link, or a follow, or a retweet, is about as meaningful as a glance or a nod. It's an indication of fairly low-level interest, nothing more. Organizing all those glances or nods into something powerful -- that's what really matters. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Micah Sifry.\n### Response : ", "target": "Micah Sifry: Growth in followers and retweets are signs of low-level interest .\nCounting something and charting it doesn't mean you've proven anything, he says .\nSifry: Rick Santorum's surge should put the mania for buzz-tracking into perspective .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Give me a one line summary of the story below:\n### Input:(CNN) -- The pictures of Tokuyoshi Takahashi's fish processing factory in northeastern Japan taken after March 11, 2011 illustrate just how destructive the tsunami was. A ship was swept on to land by the giant wave and left stranded against the front of the factory, while entire sections of wall collapsed, leaving twisted metal and debris protruding from inside. Takahashi estimated the catastrophe caused US$19 million worth of damage to his business, Takatoku , which processes fish for major supermarket chains across Japan. He was forced to lay off all of his 120 employees. \"I set a goal right after the quake,\" he said. \"All the staff would be back by January 1.\" iReport: Share your stories about last year's disaster . Three months after that deadline and he's almost there. Seventy are now back at work and he expects that number to rise to 100 by March. Though he's found many of his old employees, some have left the city all together to find work elsewhere. Takahashi is one of a small group of businessman determined to rebuild Ishinomaki, a city of around 150,000 on the coast of northeastern Japan. The tsunami caused widespread damage here, knocking down homes and wiping out the fishing port and processing factories that account for 30% of the jobs in the city. With no jobs and no homes, many have left for bigger cities like Sendai or Tokyo. The survival of the fishing industry here is deeply intertwined with that of the city itself. A year on and progress has been slow. Kunio Suno, president of the Ishinomaki Fish Market is one of city's most determined champions, spearheading the effort to create a newer and better port. He says fishing volumes are still at just a fifth of what they were before March 11, and fisherman have nowhere to sell their catch without the processing plants. His biggest frustration is with the pace of the recovery. The national government insists on following the normal -- but lengthy -- approval process for the rebuilding plans, rather than fast-tracking proposals as an emergency case. \"There is a huge gap between our feelings and those of Tokyo,\" he said. Only two weeks ago Ishinomaki's local government announced plans to rebuild the fishing industry at a cost US$1.5 billion, including support for small and medium fish processing plants. It will take three year to complete. Suno's vision for the fish market is even more ambitious. He wants to expand beyond the commercial auction and add restaurants to attract tourists, like similar sites in Sydney and Seattle. As for the processing plants, Takahashi believes only two of his competitors are back in full operation. He says others have struggled to raise capital or to rebuild the land under their factories, which sunk a meter in the disaster.

For Suno, convincing people to stay and work in Ishinomaki is about more than saving the city he's lived in for twenty years.

And does so early this year, after a former Pacific typhoon flew up toward the Arctic and rammed the jet stream. The stream has whipped south, dragging down frigid air from Canada over the northern Plains and Mountain States and the Upper Midwest, according to the National Weather Service. It is already plunging temperatures below freezing there and will hammer them into the teens and single digits in many places by midweek, even lower in others. Great Falls, Montana, will shiver at 9 below zero on Tuesday night. It's the coldest weather of the season, the weather service said. Minneapolis could soon get a foot of snow, the service said, with the Minnesota city experiencing below-freezing temperatures that could last for eight days. Let it snow . The snap is forecast to lay down the first broad layer of wintry snow, flurries, sleet or ice -- long before winter starts -- from Montana down to Nebraska and over to Wisconsin. It will accumulate in inches in the northern Rockies, northern Plains and Great Lakes. People farther south will also shiver. \"Much of the nation east of the Rockies is expected to see a major pattern change by the beginning of the work week,\" the weather service said. The western Dakotas are also forecast to get significant snow. Lows will drop to freezing in Kansas City late Monday, then into the 20s a night later. The snap will stop short, leaving much of the Deep South and Southwest in a fall-like warm zone. Rain is expected to hit Chicago and Milwaukee on Monday and Tuesday, with a few snowflakes mixed in, according to the service on Sunday afternoon. Courtesy of Nuri .

Spc. Megan Lynn Touma, 23, was a dental specialist from Cold Springs, Kentucky, according to a statement from Fort Bragg, where Touma was assigned to the 19th Replacement Company. Fayetteville police found her body late Saturday morning when they responded to a call about a strong odor coming from one of the rooms. The body was sent to the state Medical Examiner's office in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, to determine the cause of death. Touma, who was seven months pregnant, arrived at Fort Bragg on June 12. In five years with the Army, she had served with the U.S. Army Dental Activity Clinic in Bamberg, Germany, and in Fort Drum, New York, before her assignment to Fort Bragg.

{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given review.This is another one of those stories that seems absolutely hard to believe. A 6-year-old boy near Colorado Springs, Colorado, was suspended from school for kissing a girl on the hand. You read that correctly. \"It was during class,\" first-grader Hunter Yelton said in an interview with CNN affiliate KRDO. \"We were doing reading group, and I leaned over and kissed her on the hand. That's what happened.\" Not only did Hunter's peck get him suspended from school, but the school accused him of sexual harassment, KRDO reported. Hunter's mom, Jennifer Saunders, is outraged. \"This is taking it to an extreme that doesn't need to be met with a 6-year-old,\" Saunders told KRDO. Now my son's asking questions, 'What is sex, mommy?'\" She said Hunter had problems at school before, getting suspended for rough-housing and for kissing the same girl on the cheek. The family has been working with him on \"class disruptions\" by grounding him and giving him \"big restrictions,\" Saunders said. Robin Gooldy, the superintendent of Ca\u00f1on City Schools, told KRDO that Hunter's record will remain within the district and that his behavior fits the school policy description of sexual harassment, which includes unwanted touching. \"Our main interest in this is having the behavior stop because the story is not just about the student that was disciplined, it is also about the student receiving the unwanted advances,\" Gooldy told HLN. \"We have to think about both students in the situation.\" Saunders said the girl in question was \"fine with it\" because Hunter and the girl consider themselves \"boyfriend and girlfriend.\" The girl's parents have not commented publicly on the issue. But Saunders wants her son's record cleared of anything suggesting sexual harassment. On Wednesday, Saunders told CNN that the boy's school principal would ask the superintendent to reconsider removing the term sexual harassment from Hunter's record. The superintendent did not return a phone call from CNN. \"Remove it from his record,\" Saunders told KRDO. \"I need to stand up and fight for him. I can't just let that happen because it's not the case. It's not what happened at all.\" Hunter for his part said he feels \"sorry\" for doing something wrong and tries to be good in school. \"But I just have a lot of energy. Six-year-olds, they have a lot of energy,\" Hunter said. They sure do, and as a parent of a 6-year-old and a 7-year-old, an innocent peck on the cheek or on the hand seems as natural for kids this age as declarations of who they plan to marry. They don't know anything about sex or sexual harassment. So how on earth can they be accused of such behavior? Reaction online to Hunter's story has been swift, with the majority of commenters expressing pure outrage. \"The school probably traumatized the kid for life with that stupid move,\" wrote Brenda Esselman on the Facebook page for \"New Day.\" \"Poor child, he's (too) young to even know what sexual harassment is,\" Ortencia Solis also wrote on Facebook. \"Another example of how we are now overreacting to something as simple as a childhood crush,\" Benny Barboza wrote. Eric Vetch, also on Facebook, said he kissed a girl when he was 6. His punishment? \"I remember writing on the chalkboard 'I will not kiss girls at school,' and it was a private Christian school ... go figure.\" On the other side, there are a small number of people voicing some support for the school's actions. \"The kid shouldn't go around kissing someone's child. Because if it was my daughter, the parents and I would be talking. Let's keep it real,\" Russell M. Walker wrote on Facebook. We clearly need to hear more from the school and the school's district because this might turn out to be another case where the pressure to follow set school rules gets in the way of common sense. We saw this recently with two other stories: the Long Island school heavily criticized for banning most ball playing and even requiring supervision of games of tag while the school yard was under construction, and in Boston, where a student who allegedly went to a party to drive a friend home who was drunk was suspended from playing on her school's volleyball team. What do you think about this latest case of a school taking a controversial stand? Do you think a 6-year-old should be suspended and accused of sexual harassment for kissing a girl on the hand?

Halle, Belgium (CNN) -- At least 18 people died and 162 were hurt when two trains collided in Halle on Monday, a government spokeswoman said. The trains collided head-on at 8:30 a.m., the companies that run the Belgian railways and the train said. The cause of the accident is not known, according to the railway operator, Infrabel, and SNCB, the train operator. Authorities do not believe there is anyone else on the trains, said Anya De Wols, spokeswoman for the province of Flemish Brabant. But they have not ruled out the possibility bodies could be pinned beneath the train cars, she said, and they plan to lift the cars from the track by Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, investigators will collect personal effects, such as wallets, from the scene to help identify the victims, she said. Send your pictures, videos, stories . A Belgian government spokesman, Bart Ouvry, said it was snowing at the time of the crash, but not an unusual amount. People were thrown against the walls of the trains by the impact, said Emily Divinagracia, whose husband, Stephan Riviere, was a passenger. He was awakened by the impact, she said he told her by phone minutes after the accident. It took about 30 minutes for rescue crews to arrive, and some passengers did not immediately know there had been a collision, she said. \"He was actually getting the news from me, because they didn't know much on their side and it was all a bit disorganized, obviously, because nobody expected this sort of thing to happen,\" she said. Riviere was not badly injured, his wife said. The injured were being treated at a sports center near the scene of the accident, the Belga news agency reported. Fifty-five of them were taken to hospitals, while more than a hundred others had minor injuries, De Wols said. The crash took place during morning rush hour when people were on their way to work, Belga journalist Eric Vidal said from the scene. Pictures showed people being taken from the crash site by stretcher as snow fell. Passengers who were not hurt in the crash were taken away by bus, according to Vidal. He said people had come to the station to try to find family members who may have been involved in the crash. Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme is on his way back from Kosovo, Albania, and would visit the scene of the crash, his office said. The Justice Ministry is in charge of the investigation, Leterme's office added. The crash caused disruption to parts of the wider rail network in northern Europe. Eurostar suspended high-speed train services between London, England, and Brussels, Belgium, the company announced, and did not expect the trains to run for the rest of the day. London-to-Paris services were not affected, the company said, but there were delays on the service to Lille in northern France close to the border with Belgium. Thalys, which operates high-speed trains across much of northern Europe, announced that services were fully suspended all day, affecting travel to Brussels from Paris, France; Amsterdam, Netherlands; and Cologne, Germany. The company urged passengers planning to travel this week to check its Web site, www.thalys.com, before starting their trips. The French high-speed train operator TGV Europe announced that its Brussels-bound services were going only as far as Lille. Eight people died in a train crash in Belgium in March 2001, media reports said at the time, calling it the worst rail accident in the country in 25 years. Investigators later suggested the two trains collided because of confusion between a French-speaking signalman and a Flemish-speaking one. Belgium is divided between speakers of the two languages. Monday's crash is one of the deadliest train accidents in Europe since at least 41 people were killed in the Balkan nation of Montenegro in 2006. At least 180 passengers also were injured when a train derailed and plunged down an embankment outside the capital, Podgorica.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you briefly describe the text?Paris, France (CNN) -- Beneath the streets of the City of Light lies a world draped in darkness and shrouded in silence. The tunnels are narrow, the ceilings are low and death is on display. The skulls and bones lining the walls, arranged in a macabre fashion, make up what is known as the Empire of the Dead -- the Catacombs of Paris. The catacombs snake below the city, a 321-kilometer (200-mile) network of old quarries, caves and tunnels. Some Parisians are drawn to this largely uncharted territory -- a hidden network of adventure, discovery and even relaxation. They are known as 'cataphiles' and the catacombs are their playground. It is a top-secret group. Catacomb entrances are known only to those daring enough to roam the networks on their own -- and break the law. Entering unauthorized sections of the catacombs is illegal and a police force is tasked with patrolling the tunnels, and caught cataphiles risk fines of up to 60 euros ($73). But for explorers like Loic Antoine-Gambeaud and his friends, it is a risk they are willing to take. \"I think it's in the collective imagination. Everybody knows that there is something below Paris; that something goes on that's mysterious. But I don't think many people have even an idea of what the underground is like,\" Antoine-Gambeaud said. For those who want to find out, but are not willing to take the risk of going in unsupervised, there is a legal, tourist-friendly public entrance to the catacombs off Place Denfert-Rochereau. Visitors from around the world will queue up to see death on display. \"I think people are fascinated with death,\" one visitor said. \"They don't know what it's about and you see all these bones stacked up, and the people that have come before us, and it's fascinating. We're trying to find our past and it's crazy and gruesome and fun all at the same time.\" But experiencing the history of Paris in an orderly fashion is not the cataphiles' style. Underground, there are plaques echoing the street names above etched into the walls, helping the cataphiles navigate. Often equipped only with head lamps and homemade maps, they explore the tunnels and ancient rooms, sometimes staying underground for days at a time. They throw parties, drink wine, or just relax in a silence they say can't be experienced anywhere else. The catacombs are a by-product of Paris' early development. Builders dug deep underground to extract limestone to build Paris above ground. But the subterranean quarries that were formed proved to be a shaky foundation for the city, causing a number of streets to collapse and be swallowed up by the ground. Eventually, repairs and reinforcements were made, and to this day, the tunnels and quarries are still monitored for safety. The quarries went through several transformations throughout history. Over time, they have served as everything from hiding places for revolutionaries to mushroom farms. In the 18th century the Catacombs became known as the Empire of the Dead. Paris' dead had been buried in cemeteries and beneath churches in the city center, but the number of bodies began to overwhelm the land, breaking through the walls of people's cellars and causing major health concerns. So, beginning in the 1780s, the bodies were transferred in carriages at night to a new, final resting place in the old quarries. In those tunnels there are now the remains of more than six million people. And for the cataphiles, the life among the dead opens up new dreams and possibilities. \"It's like an alternate reality,\" Antoine-Gambeaud said. \"You don't have the same sort of social interaction with people as you do above. You are free to invent yourself again, to be somebody else.\" Bone people: The explorers of the Parisian catacombs .\n### Response: ", "target": "Beneath the streets of the French capital lies a hidden, macabre Parisian playground .\nThe catacombs are also the last resting place for six million people .\nAdventurous Parisians use the underground network as a place to party and relax .\nOne said: You are free to invent yourself again, to be somebody else .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- The two-day ritual slaughter of tens of thousands of animals -- among the world's largest sacrifice of animals -- began Tuesday in southern Nepal, officials said. About 200,000 animals, including male water buffalo, goats and roosters will be slaughtered, despite protests from animal rights activists, according to the chief priest of the festival. People from Nepal and India sacrifice animals to the goddess Gadhimai in the Bara district, about 150 kilometers (about one mile) south of Kathmandu, in thanks for wishes granted. \"This is a divine power center,\" Mangal Chaudhary, the head priest of the Gadhimai temple, said by phone. \"When people wish for a son, a job, good health or anything else come true, they make an offering to the Gadhimai goddess.\" He expects more than 5 million people -- 60 percent from India, which shares an open border with Nepal -- to attend the festival. About 15,000 male water buffalo will be slaughtered, up from 12,000 five years ago, said Chaudhary, who is the 10th generation of his family to serve as chief priest. Water buffalo are slaughtered on the first day, and other animals on the second day. Government officials say they cannot stop the centuries-old tradition, despite opposition from animal-rights activists from Nepal and India. \"This is a matter of people's religion and belief,\" said chief district officer Tara Nath Gautam, the highest-ranking government official in Bara. Animal rights activists say they aren't looking for a sea change. \"We do not expect this practice to stop overnight. A sustained effort is needed so that, sometime, the practice will end,\" said Nepali animal rights activist Pramada Shah. Though meat from the sacrificed animals is given to devotees, the hides of water buffalo are taken by the festival management committee to sell. The heads are buried on the temple premises, which spread over three square kilometers, Chaudhary said. Buffalo is eaten by low castes in Nepal and India, but goat meat is eaten by a wider population. An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 goats are sacrificed, Chaudhary said.

{"source": "### Instruction :I need a summary of the review.She had a 1-year-old child inside and apparently was unarmed. Instead, the motorist's black Infiniti, according to authorities, itself became a weapon Thursday afternoon, first striking a security barrier and U.S. Secret Service officer near the White House before hurtling down some of the capital's most famous streets, police cruisers in pursuit. Dramatic video taken minutes later near the U.S. Capitol showed the vehicle backing into a police vehicle before the chase resumed. Gunshots rang through the traffic circle. The motorist was shot by police just a few blocks away. The woman died. The child was safe and in protective custody. Two officers were injured. Police vehicles were damaged. And a city heretofore fixated on a partial government shutdown was left with unanswered questions. Why did this happen? Why did the woman drive away from the White House and toward Capitol Hill? While U.S. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine said there appeared to be no evidence of terrorism, Metropolitan Police Department Chief Cathy Lanier said, \"This does not appear to be in any way an accident.\" Officials, who called it an \"isolated incident,\" were tight-lipped about the suspect and did not name her at an evening briefing. The early hours of the investigation turned northward Thursday night. A task force prepared to execute a search warrant at the woman's Stamford, Connecticut, residence, law enforcement sources said. Police and bomb squad units surrounded an apartment complex. Authorities wanted to speak with the suspect's relatives in Brooklyn, New York, but were turned away, federal law enforcement sources told CNN. The chase created a chaotic scene of blaring sirens, locked-down lawmakers and bystanders hitting the dirt. House and Senate sessions were immediately suspended, with legislators ordered to take cover and keep away from windows. Police also closed Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House. The chase began near the White House. A U.S. Secret Service source said when the woman drove up to a barrier at the 15th and E street checkpoint, she was approached by Secret Service officers who did not recognize her car. The motorist hurriedly tried to drive away, executed a three-point turn, struck the barrier and backed into an officer before driving away, the source told CNN. Police said the car sped down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol, where security vehicles stopped it at Garfield Circle. Frank Schwing, a Washington resident who was near the area, said officers \"came out with their guns drawn\" and approached the suspect's vehicle. \"At that point, the driver slammed into reverse, slammed into a cruiser, did a 180 (degree turn), took off,\" Schwing told CNN, adding, \"at that point, there were a half dozen or so shots fired,\" apparently all by small arms from police. Video footage by other witnesses showed the black vehicle then careening around a nearby traffic circle with a police car in close pursuit and then headed away. Shortly afterward, the car crashed into security barriers a few blocks away, witnesses said. Lanier said more shots were fired after the vehicle stopped, and the woman was hit several times. The driver was later pronounced dead, Lanier said. According to multiple sources, there was no reason so far to believe that the woman fired any shots or even had a weapon. Officers did not know a child was inside during the chase, officials said. Lanier, citing the lengthy pursuit, rammed vehicles and an attempt to breach two security perimeters, said the driver's actions did not appear to be accidental. Security perimeters at the White House and Capitol worked, Lanier told reporters. \"They did exactly what they were supposed to do,\" she said. A Capitol Police officer whose vehicle crashed during the chase also was hurt, authorities said. The officer was released from a local hospital Thursday night. The Secret Service did not release information about its injured agent. Authorities lauded the action of police -- some of whom aren't being paid -- who responded to the incident. Because of the government shutdown, U.S. Capitol Police aren't receiving a paycheck, although they will receive checks once appropriations are restored. In Congress, a Capitol Police bulletin said reports of gunshots required \"all occupants in all House office buildings to shelter in place.\" \"Close, lock and stay away from external doors and windows,\" the bulletin said. Authorities later lifted the lockdown, with police saying they believed the incident was isolated. President Barack Obama was briefed on the situation, which occurred on the third day of a government shutdown due to a stalemate in Congress over government funding. \"The timing on this was really kind of scary,\" said Republican Rep.

The gunmen opened fire after forcing the convoy of eight oil tankers to stop in an area 90 kilometers (55 miles) southwest of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, police official Abdul Qadir said. The militants killed one of the truck's drivers and set the tankers on fire before they escaped, Qadir said. Fuel and supply trucks contracted to supply NATO have been left stranded in Pakistan by Islamabad's decision to block its two NATO supply routes to Afghanistan. Pakistan closed the routes to protest a NATO airstrike that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers last month. The airstrike plunged Islamabad and Washington into one of their worst diplomatic crises ever. In a television interview on Sunday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said the blockade of Pakistan's NATO supply routes could continue for weeks until \"new rules of engagement\" were established with Washington. The blockade leaves stranded supply trucks vulnerable to militants in Pakistan who have increasingly targeted the convoys in an effort to undermine the NATO mission in Afghanistan. Sunday's attack was the second of its kind in four days. On Thursday, militants armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons attacked and destroyed more than 20 NATO-bound oil tankers just outside Quetta.

{"source": "### Instruction :Can you give me the gist of this text?\n### Input:Lake Victoria, Uganda (CNN) -- Straddling three East African countries -- Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya -- Lake Victoria has for centuries been a vital resource for the millions of people living along its vast coastline. The massive lake, which stretches some 70,000 square kilometers, is the world's second-biggest freshwater body and the biggest of its kind in Africa, as well as the chief reservoir of the Nile. Home to a stunning archipelago of more than 80 islands, Lake Victoria provides a livelihood for the fishermen navigating its waters and the businesses dotting its shores. But for many that comes with a risk. According to local officials, about 5,000 people are killed every year on the lake, victims of erratic weather conditions and a mix of poor communications and lack of resources. The high death toll makes the lake \"arguably the most dangerous stretch of water in the world in terms of fatalities per square kilometer,\" according to The National Lake Rescue Institute, a group launched in 2002 to improve safety on Lake Victoria and provide education and training in maritime safety. See also: 'Hippie apes' battle for survival . \"It's very dangerous,\" says Sam Kabonge, a fisherman from the Bugala island in Lake Victoria, a tropical patch of land boasting sandy shores and lush forests. \"You sit on top of water not knowing the depth of the pitch you are sitting on so in any case of accident ... even if you do [know how to swim], you might be far away in the lake.\" Kabonge says not all fishermen can afford life jackets. At the same time, their small and often dilapidated vessels can easily succumb to the wind-whipped waves formed in the lake by its volatile microclimate. \"There are times when you may leave the landing site when the lake is still,\" explains Kabonge. \"As you are in the middle of it, it starts getting rough -- rain, winds, clouds, and you know what happens next because ... our boats, cannot resist the strength of the wave. Sometimes they break; others capsize.\" See also: School boy's website helps tourists spot big beasts . Ugandan meteorologist Khalid Muwembe says the lake, which lies on the Equator, has a distinct effect on the region's weather. \"Because the lake is generally warm and has a lot of moisture, we find that it generates this very big, what we call, convective potential energy, which generates a lot of cloudness and this unique nature of weather characterized by heavy thunderstorms which sometimes can be dangerous,\" he explains. Muwembe is part of a team testing a new mobile alert system aiming to improve the delivery of weather forecasts and help vulnerable fishing communities in Lake Victoria protect themselves from dangerous conditions. Under the free pilot program, locals receive tailor-made text messages on their mobile phones, providing them with daily weather forecasts, warnings about potential hazards and advice on what action they should take. See also: Wildlife puts Tanzania on the tourist map . Muwembe says the mobile alert weather system is helping fishermen to plan safer outings. \"For a long period of time, we didn't have a very good weather service to try and guide and promote safety of all those navigating over the lake,\" he says. \"So because of that -- and also daily reports of accidents over the lake -- we thought it was very important that we have a weather system where we are giving the users of the small vessels over the lake at least some guidance on what kind of storms they expect to find over the lake.\" \"We provide this information on a daily basis as texts on their mobile phones and in a situation where we see that there is a very dangerous storm which is developing, we also give them an additional message, which we call an alert. We say that 'this is happening, please take action, or hold position,' or whatever it is that will at least promote safety,\" he adds. For fishermen like Kabonge, who is among those involved in the pilot program, the localized weather information is a vital service that can help people in the community stay safe. \"We need it because ever since it came, at least the death tolls have reduced,\" says Kabonge, who calls for the program's expansion. \"The lake is too wide -- if it [the program] could go across the whole lake, our brothers also may get use of it.\" And for Kabonge that is what is most important -- to use new technology to help protect the lives of Lake Victoria's fishermen.

{"source": "### Instruction: Can you walk me through the main ideas?KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The war in Afghanistan may no longer be forgotten but the true victims always are. Having been denied healthcare and education under the Taliban, Afghan women are now training as midwives . Women and children in the landlocked Asian country have continuously paid the ultimate price throughout the decades of conflict and war. It is their lives that are considered not precious enough to save. A woman here dies every 29 minutes due to childbirth complications, according to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) -- one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world. One in four children die before they reach the age of five because of the lack of health care and medical facilities in their cities and villages. But ignorance is also deadly. Misguided cultural pride prevents men from allowing their women to see a doctor, merely because the doctor could be male. And in many cases, it's not just women who die from childbirth-related issues. It is young girls forced into marriage before they even reach puberty. Their still-forming bodies cannot handle the complications of childbirth. But there are women in Afghanistan stepping up within the crowds of the forgotten and pushing past the barriers. They are training as midwives across the country to help bring change and save lives. \"A woman can help a woman more,\" midwifery student Fariha Ibrahimi told CNN. \"We have to introduce them with what to do, what foods to eat, how to take care of themselves. \"[We] tell their husbands how to treat them. There are some husbands who beat their wives to the point where they can no longer even get pregnant.\" At the Ibni Sina Balkhi Midwifery Training Center in Kabul, dozens of future midwives study and practise in the hope of bringing a brighter future to their countrywomen. \"It's very heartbreaking,\" Ibrahimi said of the situation women face. \"Afghanistan has gone through so much war and most girls were not allowed to get an education, so I want to study and bring forth something new.\" Sympathy for Afghan women is the strongest motivating force among students in this field: Many know personally what is like to live in a society where pregnant women are ignored and forgotten. \"We live in an area where we are far from any clinic or hospital and there are a lot of difficulties there for pregnant women,\" Nourzia, a student and mother, told CNN. \"It's very difficult for them to reach a hospital. This is why I was so keen in learning this profession and helping these women; so in the future they are in less danger.\" All the women here are training with the permission and support of their families. They are leading the way to a brighter tomorrow for Afghan women -- one that may one day catch up with the rest of the world. \"The world is moving forward and he didn't want me to sit around jobless,\" said future midwife, Maurina whose husband is supportive of her new career. \"He wanted me to push ahead in this field, especially a field in which our people need help in.\" There are still many obstacles left and these women are still in the minority. According to the World Health Organization there are only about 2,000 trained midwives servicing Afghanistan's population of just under 33 million. But that is a giant leap from just eight years ago when most women were denied an education, medical care and the basic necessities of survival under the Taliban regime. It will take many years to change mindsets instilled by decades of brutality. But these women prove that maybe, just maybe, the next generation can fix the mistakes of the last.\n### Response: ", "target": "Afghanistan has one of the highest rates of maternal and infant mortality in the world .\nA woman dies in childbirth every 29 minutes, one in four children die before age 5 .\nIn Kabul, dozens of women are now studying to become midwives to help save lives .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

More than 30,800 of them have sought refuge in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the U.N. People continue to go there and other nearby nations, the agency said. \"Over the last two weeks our offices have reported fresh arrivals into Chad, Cameroon and Democratic Republic of the Congo,\" UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards told journalists in Geneva. A coalition of rebels ousted the Central African Republic's president, Francois Bozize, last month, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence from France in 1960. Last year, several rebel groups under the umbrella name of Seleka started seizing parts of the country. In January, the rebels and the government brokered a peace deal that included a cease-fire and an agreement to form a unity government led by Bozize. But that deal fell apart as the rebel coalition pushed its way from its base in the north toward Bangui, seizing towns along the way. The U.N. refugee agency said it is working with authorities in the countries where the refugees are arriving to provide protection and assistance. UNHCR teams are distributing aid and setting up emergency shelters, Edwards said. \"Many left their homes in a hurry and were unable to bring personal belongings with them.

Some South African soldiers were killed in clashes, according to a statement from the office of French President Francois Hollande. South African officials could not be immediately reached for comment. A United Nations spokeswoman based in Bangui described the situation as confusing and very tense. \"A number of U.N. offices have been looted as well as residences of some U.N. personnel,\" spokeswoman Uwolowulakana Ikavi said. Sounds of fierce gunfire rang out for hours Sunday, she said. The country has been on edge since rebel fighters pushed their way into the capital. The wave of unrest started in December, when the Seleka rebel coalition launched its offensive. The rebels accused Bozize of reneging on a peace deal and demanded that he step down. The rebel group, based in the country's north, managed to take control of several towns and move toward Bangui in the following weeks. The Seleka and the government brokered a new peace deal in January, agreeing to form a unity government led by Bozize. But that peace deal also fell apart. On Saturday, about 150 French troops secured the airport in Bangui. France also asked for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting to address the crisis in its former colony. Hollande's office said the French president had spoken Sunday with South African President Jacob Zuma, expressing condolences for the soldiers' deaths. \"They called on all the parties to be calm,\" the statement from Hollande's office said, \"to stop looting and to respect the political accords of Libreville,\" where leaders signed a peace deal in January.

The African Union condemned the Seleka rebels' renewed offensive and also announced a travel ban and asset freeze against political and military actors involved in violating humanitarian rights or the January peace agreement. Meanwhile, on Sunday, U.N. officials in the Central African Republic were preparing to evacuate. U.N. staff on the ground in Bangui are not allowed to leave the compound, Ikavi said, and non-essential staff will be evacuated or relocated once the security situation allows. \"As a human being, I am afraid,\" Ikavi said. \"No one can stay calm when you hear heavy shooting not far from the place that you are staying.\" CNN's Jennifer Deaton contributed to this report.\n### Response:", "target": "NEW: Rebel official: \"The Central African Republic has just opened a new page in its history\"\nNEW: U.N. offices are among the targets of looting, a spokeswoman says .\nRebels seize control of capital of Central African Republic, official says .\nPresident left Bangui via the Democratic Republic of Congo, an official says .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?(CNN) -- Four journalists and an executive from a Myanmar magazine have been sentenced to 10 years of hard labor on charges of violating state secrets by claiming the military was making chemical weapons. The sentencing has drawn an outcry from international media and rights watchdogs, who say it is evidence of a drastic rollback of press freedoms this year in a country that had been praised for its reforms since 2011. Those sentenced -- reporters Yazar Soe, Sithu Soe, Lu Maw Naing, and Paing Thet Kyaw and chief executive Tint San -- all worked for the Yangon-based current affairs magazine Unity Weekly, said Tint's lawyer, Than Saw Aung. They had been convicted under the country's 1923 State Secrets Act, Than said, adding that his client would appeal the sentence. The periodical, which has since been shuttered, had published stories in January alleging that Myanmar's military had seized hundreds of hectares of land to build a factory to manufacture chemical weapons, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Myanmar's government has previously denied accusations it has used chemical weapons against ethnic rebels. \"CPJ is alarmed that journalists were tried under a 100-year-old spying statute and slammed with an outrageously harsh sentence,\" said CPJ's Asia program coordinator Bob Dietz, Asia program coordinator in a statement calling for donor countries to Myanmar to exert pressure over the case. \"This conviction should shatter any illusions that President Thein Sein's government grasps the role of a free press in a democracy.\" Myanmar's presidential spokesman Ye Htut could not be reached for comment. 'Back to square one' Scores of journalists, some of them wearing T-shirts that read \"Stop killing press,\" gathered at Yangon's Shwedagon Pagoda Friday offering prayers for the sentenced journalists Friday, while some publications printed blacked-out front pages in protest. Aung Zaw, editor of news magazine The Irrawaddy, told CNN the case showed it was \"back to square one\" in terms of press freedom in Myanmar, also known as Burma. \"The sad fact is Burma overnight restored its former title as enemy of the press,\" he said. The government could have asked for a retraction or correction if the report was untrue, he said, or prosecuted the Unity staff using newly passed media laws. Instead, it had chosen to bludgeon them using the colonial-era State Secrets Act to send \"a serious warning to other journalists.\" He said the harsh sentences handed down had shocked journalists, but also made them more resolute not to back down from their work. Tide turned . While Myanmar has been praised for reforms in recent years, rights groups say the tide appears to have turned when it comes to media freedom. Benjamin Ismail, the head of Reporters Without Borders' Asia-Pacific desk, described the court's decision in a statement as \"a grave setback for press freedom.\" He said it marked \"a return to a dark time when journalists and bloggers who did their job were jailed on national security charges or for allegedly trying to overthrow the government.\" Rupert Abbott, Amnesty International's deputy Asia-Pacific director, said in a statement that the sentences reflected \"a wider crackdown on free media since the beginning of the year, despite government assurances that such practices would end.\" Myanmar President Thein Sein warned in a speech earlier this week that the increased press freedom the country had enjoyed should be used without threatening the stability of the state, the state-run New Light of Myanmar reported. Reporters Without Borders says that while no journalists were imprisoned in Myanmar in 2012, they have been the target of a growing number of prosecutions this year. Reporters from local media outlets have been jailed this year, and a foreign journalist deported after covering a press freedom rally. Zaw said the resumption of official antagonism towards the fourth estate was reflected in a visit to The Irrawaddy's newsroom by special branch officers in recent weeks. He claimed the officers, who would not reveal who had sent them, had harassed staff about the magazine's editorial positions and finances. \"It was a sign of intimidation,\" he said. Burma is ranked 145th out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders press freedom index.

{"source": "### Instruction:Read the following passage and summarize it.(CNN) -- Reports that Schapelle Corby could earn millions of dollars for her first post-jail media interview have triggered howls of protest that crime will have paid for the Australian drug trafficker. But legal experts say Australia's proceeds of crime laws could ultimately make it a challenge for her to hold on to any profits made from selling her story. A high-profile breakfast host for Australian television network Seven -- the broadcaster tipped to be the front-runner to secure the Corby interview -- spoke out on-air Tuesday voicing his disapproval at unconfirmed reports his bosses were set to pay A$2 million (about $1.8 million) for her story. \"I reckon we should have nothing to do with her as a network. Totally disagree with paying a convicted drug smuggler A$2 million,\" said David Koch, co-host of the Sunrise program. \"I know Indonesia's corrupt and all that sort of stuff, but you know, she's convicted, so why pay the money?\" Seven did not respond to CNN's request for comment, but in Bali, Seven journalist Mike Willesee told reporters outside the luxury compound where Corby has been staying with her family that the network was paying for security guards attached to her since her release. He said a deal had not yet been struck to secure the interview, but disputed the amounts cited by Koch. Corby, 36, was released on parole from a prison in Bali, Indonesia, Monday after being convicted almost nine years ago of smuggling 9 pounds (4.1 kilograms) of marijuana into Bali's Denpasar International Airport. She has maintained she was the victim of a set-up and many Australians sympathize with her cause. Her case has attracted immense interest from Australian media, and on her release she was mobbed by a throng of reporters chasing an interview. But Jenna Price, senior lecturer in journalism at the University of Technology, Sydney, said forking out big dollars for the Corby interview \"could backfire\" on the network that successfully bid on her story this time. She said there was a long tradition of \"checkbook journalism\" by Australia's highly competitive commercial broadcasters, stretching back to the Lindy Chamberlain case in the 1980s. But while popular sentiment surrounding certain stories, such as the Beaconsfield mine collapse survivors, held that subjects were entitled to financially benefit from their experiences, public sympathy for, and interest in, Corby appeared to have waned in the years since her conviction. \"I just don't think people feel very fondly about Schapelle Corby. They just don't,\" said Price. \"They did, and then they got bored with her.\" On social media, many were critical of the reports of an impending big payday for Corby. \"I see a line of pot smugglers heading towards Bali, thinking 'In 10 years, I'll be rich!'\" wrote Twitter user @milesb. \"That's 200k per year her jail time... Plus other money she's going to make... Not a bad wage,\" wrote @Crafterxxx. Checkbook journalism by television networks has been under scrutiny in Australia recently, after Seven reportedly paid a significant sum for an interview with the partner of Simon Gittany, subsequently sentenced today to 18 years for having murdered his former girlfriend. Price said the negative public response to Corby's potential paycheck were in part \"a response to being bored to tears\" by the saga. \"The entire time she's been in prison, every bit of Schapelle's life has been thoroughly explored. What more could she possibly tell us?\" She said unimpressive ratings for a telemovie based on Corby's story were evidence of the public's fatigue. \"It's staggering to me that Seven is doing this because they must have had some indication that the audience was tiring of the story.\" Hugh McDermott, senior law enforcement lecturer at Charles Sturt University, said Corby could find it difficult to hold on to any money earned for an interview, due to Australian laws allowing the government to seize assets acquired through the proceeds of criminal activity. Australian authorities had previously used those provisions to seize Corby's earnings from a magazine interview, he said. \"There's a real question as to whether there would be an appetite to go after her, because she is so popular here in some sectors, but there are people in Indonesian law enforcement who would very much like to go after her if she's paid that money,\" he said. Under an agreement between Australia and Indonesia, Indonesian authorities could request that their Australian counterparts act to recover the funds. However, Corby could attempt to put the money beyond reach of officials by placing it in an offshore bank account or trust, he said. \"If she's smart, she will put the money offshore so it can't be touched,\" he said. The first clear picture of Corby since her release appeared in Australian media Tuesday, a picture of her toasting her freedom with a beer alongside her brother. The picture was subsequently removed from websites amid a dispute over who owned, and who had been paid for, the photo.\n### Response : ", "target": "Australian TV networks are chasing an interview with drug trafficker Schapelle Corby .\nA tradition of checkbook journalism means she stands to earn a significant amount .\nA host for the network tipped to secure the interview has publicly criticized any payment .\nExperts say any funds could be recovered by authorities under proceeds of crime laws .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Unlike most of the other elephants that die on any given day in Africa, this particular elephant was slain legally. Namibia has reportedly sold nine hunting permits to foreign hunters for undisclosed amounts. Two of the bulls, including the first to be killed last month, are \u201cproblem\u201d animals who have come into conflict with local humans. The remaining seven will be killed for their trophies. \n  \n Desert elephants, which can only be found in Namibia and Mali, are not a separate species or subspecies. They are, however, uniquely adapted to their arid environments. The animals have a few morphological differences from savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana), most notably their thinner bodies and wider feet. They also possess a number of unique behaviors shared by no other African elephants, such as digging wells to purify their drinking water. Tourists routinely travel to Namibia to volunteer in the elephants\u2019 conservation and organizations such as Desert Lion and Elephant Conservation have been set up to protect and study them. \n  \n Namibia\u2019s desert elephants were nearly wiped out by poachers before the international ivory ban was first established in 1989. The country says it is now home to about 600 desert elephants, a number that conservationists dispute. According to the Conservation Action Trust, there are only about 100 desert elephants left in Namibia, including just 18 adult males. The cull would remove half of those males. According to the organization, the loss of adult role models would create more behavior problems in the future and also result in a loss of the population\u2019s unique mannerisms. \n  \n Namibia, however, does not see its desert elephants as animals that are any different from the other elephants within its borders. In a press release (pdf) sent at the beginning of June, Simeon N. Negumbo, permanent secretary of Namibia\u2019s Ministry of Environment and Tourism, wrote that the country is home to more than 20,000 elephants and the region where the hunts will take place has a total of 391 elephants with a 55 percent sex ratio. He called desert elephants \u201ctourist attractions\u201d and said all elephants in the country are \u201cno longer rare\u2026but only potentially valuable.\u201d He noted that human\u2013wildlife conflict is increasing, and that some humans have been killed by elephant attacks. \n  \n Especially ironic given that last point, a hunter named Johann Louw was attacked and trampled by a Namibian elephant on July 5. Louw and his hunting party had reportedly received one of the nine desert elephant hunting permits. Louw has been hospitalized. The fate of the elephant that attacked him is unknown as of this writing. \n  \n This entire situation echoes so many of the problems facing elephants today. In many regions the animals are being poached into oblivion. In a few others they are mostly protected and breeding well but are also increasingly crowded into ever-shrinking habitats, putting them in conflict with both humans and their own kind as they compete for food and space. I have been writing about elephants now for 25 years and it\u2019s impossible to say how this will all pan out. Tragically, the only certain outcome I can see these days is death. \n  \n Photos: Desert elephant bull and cow photographed by Vernon Swanepoel.

As the permits specify adult males, the trust says that part of the population\u2014estimated at 18\u2014will be cut in half, Popular Science reports. In Namibia's view, this is not a cause for concern. The environment and tourism ministry last month asserted there is \"no such thing\" as a desert elephant, as it's simply a common African elephant that has adapted to desert conditions. With 20,000 elephants within its borders and 391 in the area where the hunt will occur, elephants are \"no longer rare ... but only potentially valuable,\" the ministry maintains. As for reports that the permits are being offered in exchange for political votes, it says that is \"inaccurate, false.\" While it's true desert elephants aren't a unique species, they \"possess a number of unique behaviors shared by no other African elephants, such as digging wells to purify their drinking water,\" and have both thinner bodies and wider feet, writes John Platt at Scientific American.

{"source": "### Instruction: Can you walk me through the main ideas?(CNN) -- Two Syrian Orthodox bishops remain missing two days after being kidnapped, with each side in the civil war blaming others for the snatching. The whereabouts of the two prominent clergymen, Greek Orthodox Bishop Paul Yazigi and Syriac Orthodox Bishop John Ibrahim, remain unknown, despite some reports to the contrary, Greek Orthodox Bishop Mousa Khoury told CNN. There have been several kidnappings of Christian clergymen in Syria but the two bishops are the most senior church figures who have been abducted since the beginning of the uprising. The Syrian regime's Ministry of Religious Endowment issued a statement blaming \"this brutal act\" on Chechen mercenaries operating under the mantle of Jabhat al-Nusra and al-Qaeda. The government did not provide evidence to back up the claim. A spokesman for the Free Syrian Army said the government itself could be behind the kidnappings. \"The timing is very suspicious and we believe the Assad regime is behind the kidnapping,\" Louay Almokdad told CNN. Another opposition figure, Rami Abdurrahman of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, elaborated, saying they believe that non-Arab foreign fighters are behind the kidnappings. \"We know that there are foreign fighters who are infiltrated by the regime and the Assad regime is well known for being a ventriloquist of proxy groups that they set up in order to spread chaos, strife and to divide the ranks of the opposition,\" he said. CNN cannot independently confirm the claims by either side. Earlier, there were conflicting reports about the status of the bishops. \"The bishops were supposed to be released by the armed group yesterday evening; then we expected them to head back to their churches. But they didn't, so we are still carrying out all efforts to figure out what happened,\" Abdel Ahad Steifo, a prominent Syriac member of Syria's main opposition group, told CNN. Steifo, who is in charge of the negotiations for the release of the clergymen, says he does not know the identity of the kidnappers. But they are not part of the opposition, he said. In an interview with the Vatican's Fides News Agency, the Chaldean bishop of Aleppo, Antoine Audo, said that at the root of the \"scourge of kidnapping\" is not politics, but \"the pursuit of money on behalf of armed gangs.\" Recent incidents of clergymen being kidnapped ended with their release after ransoms of thousands of dollars were paid, he said. On Tuesday, the director of the Holy See press office, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said Pope Francis is closely following the events in Syria. The pope is \"praying for the health and the liberation of the two kidnapped bishops,\" Lombardi said. A number of Muslim clerics have also been killed and kidnapped in Syria, including a top Sunni cleric and longtime supporter of President Bashar al-Assad, Mohammad Said Ramadan al-Bouti, who was killed in a suspicious blast while teaching religious class in Damascus. Rebels and regime officials blamed each other for the assassination of al-Bouti.

Nadal, whose incredible form on clay has seen him go unbeaten at the tournament since 2003, showed little discomfort in dispatching Nieminen despite suffering persistent injury problems with his left knee.

in this issue of critical care , dr martin and \n colleagues consider the effects of hypoxia on physiology , and they review mechanisms allowing cells and organisms to tolerate oxygen deprivation without sustaining injury . \n one mechanism involves the up - regulation of protective genes by hypoxia - inducible factor ( hif ) transcription factors . \n the cadre of genes controlled by hif varies among cell types , but generally includes the expression of glycolytic enzymes , glucose transporters , vascular growth factors , and genes regulating vascular tone and systemic oxygen transport . \n hif also contributes to the down - regulation of mitochondrial respiration , which lessens tissue need for oxygen . \n loss of hif is lethal during embryonic development , largely because hypoxia acts as a morphogen controlling migration and differentiation of cells in the embryo and placenta . \n other systems engaged by hypoxia include amp - dependent protein kinase ( ampk ) , which responds to increases in cellular [ amp ] and is also activated by hypoxia . \n interestingly , o2 acts as a signal in triggering the activation of both hif and ampk during hypoxia by releasing low levels of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) from the electron transport chain . \n these ros migrate to the inter - membrane space where they can escape to the cytosol and trigger the activation of hif and ampk . \n thus , o2 acts in a paradoxical manner as a signaling molecule activating protective mechanisms during hypoxia . \n martin and colleagues raise the provocative concept of ' permissive hypoxia ' in critical illness . to be sure , the degree to which hypoxemia should be corrected \n a reduction in cellular energy demand during hypoxia , a form of adaptive hibernation , could lessen the consequences of oxygen deprivation . \n but before we reach for the fio2 control on the ventilator , we should consider other arguments . \n first , organ failure is essentially a situation where cells fail to perform their normal tissue function . in heart failure , \n cardiomyocytes are alive yet they fail to contract normally . in hypoxic tissues , adaptive responses might foster survival , but the consequences for organ function can be catastrophic . \n for example , in hypoxic lungs ros signals activate ampk , which triggers internalization of the epithelial na , k - atpase , an enzyme essential for alveolar edema reabsorption . \n hence , responses triggered by hypoxia may not optimize tissue repair and survival in the critically ill . \n microvascular heterogeneity in the patient can create local hypoxic areas within excessively perfused regions . at the tissue level perfusion \n a parallel situation occurs in solid tumors , where local cellular anoxia occurs despite high blood flows and excessive ( albeit abnormally structured ) capillary density . \n hypoxia triggers protective responses , but not all of these are adaptive at the tissue level . \n a better understanding of the heterogeneity of microvascular oxygen supply in the critically ill patient would help us begin to understand the situation before we turn down the oxygen . \n ampk : amp - dependent protein kinase ; hif : hypoxia - inducible factor ; ros : reactive oxygen species . \n  \n \n### Response: ", "target": "human cells require o2 for their energy supply , and critical illness can threaten the efficient delivery of o2 in accordance with tissue metabolic needs . in the accompanying article , martin and colleagues point out that hypoxia is a normal and well - tolerated stress during embryonic development \n . a better understanding of how fetal cells survive these conditions and how adult cells adapt to high altitude exposure may provide insight into how these mechanisms might be engaged in the treatment of hypoxemic patients . \n they suggest that ' permissive hypoxia ' represents a therapeutic possibility . but before we turn down the inspired o2 levels we should consider the broader effects of hypoxia on tissue repair in critical illness .", "origin": "pubmed.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction :Give me a one line summary of the story below:Havana, Cuba -- Alejandro Robaina, considered a legend among Cuban tobacco growers, died Saturday, according to Cuban cigar company Habanos S.A., which produced cigars named for him. Robaina was 91. He was diagnosed with cancer last year and died on his farm in the western Cuban province of Pinar del Rio, said Habanos spokesman Jose Antonio Candia. Robaina's tobacco leaves are considered some of the best in the world. In Cuba, he was called \"The Godfather.\" His deeply wrinkled face smiled out from billboards, T-shirts and boxes of Vegas Robaina cigars, among Cuba's finest. A box of premium Vegas Robaina cigars can fetch more than $500 on the international market. But the man behind the smile was also a simple country farmer who got up at the crack of dawn every day to survey his fields until cancer slowed him down. \"I wouldn't say I've triumphed, but I've done something with my life,\" he told CNN in 2008. \"The first thing is to love the land, take care of the land.\" Robaina's family have farmed tobacco continuously since 1845 on the plantation. Under Robaina, business flourished, and the plantation had some of the best yields in the region, producing highly-prized wrapper leaves used for the outer layer of cigars. Cigar aficionados around the globe called him the dean of Cuba's cigar industry and every year thousands of visitors made the two-hour trek from Havana, hoping to share a stogie and a glass of rum with \"the Don.\" Robaina kept his lands even when many ranches were nationalized after the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro. \"I had a very strong conversation with Fidel 18 or 20 years ago,\" Robaina said in 2008. \"He asked if I would join a big cooperative since I had so many workers, and I told him no. \"For me tobacco growing had to be in the family, done with love. Because in the big cooperatives, everyone's the boss, nobody worries as much as the grower.\" Now, almost all of Cuba's tobacco farms are private, according to the Agriculture Ministry. And they generally take their lead from Robaina, planting and harvesting on the same days he did. \"I like to sow during a waxing moon, and harvest in a waning moon,\" he said. Robaina said he'd been smoking cigars since he was 10 years old. \"When I get really old, I'll stop smoking the strong stuff,\" he said. In 1997, Cuba launched the Vegas Robaina brand, named in his honor. They're made from the golden wrapper leaves grown on Robaina's plantation but are rolled in a separate factory. Like most of Cuba's cigars, they're largely exported. Because of the U.S. trade embargo, however, Cuban cigars are off-limits in America. Robaina said in 2008 he hoped that policy would end during his lifetime. \"Of course I have hope they'll open up the market,\" he said. \"Cuba's willing to send cigars and they're willing to smoke them. They're going crazy because they can't smoke cigars from here.\" Robaina will be buried Sunday, said Candia.\n### Response: ", "target": "Robaina, who was diagnosed with cancer last year, died on his farm in Pinar del Rio .\nRobaina's tobacco leaves are considered some of the best in the world .\nA box of premium Vegas Robaina cigars can fetch more than $500 .\nRobaina kept his lands after the 1959 revolution, when many others' were nationalized .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?(CNN) -- Early next month, Casey Rocheteau will pack up the belongings of her Brooklyn flat, say goodbye to friends and set-off for her new home in Detroit, Michigan. The \"Motor City\" was once regarded as the engine room of the U.S. economy but it has fallen upon hard times in recent decades -- or so the popular narrative goes. Now, a new venture which combines housing and the literary arts is hoping to paint the modern story of the Detroit in a more positive light. Rocheteau is the first person to receive a home completely for free as part of the Detroit Write A House program. The non-profit project is buying up and renovating foreclosed homes using crowd-sourced funds in the city's Banglatown district. It then gives them to promising literary prospects in the fields of fiction, non-fiction, screen writing, poetry and journalism among others. All Rocheteau has to do on her end of the deal is to pay fees for insurance and taxes, take part in local literary readings and promise to live in the house for at least two years. The-29-year-old originally from Cape Cod was selected by judges from a host of other applicants for the house on the strength of her poetry that \"breaks through\" and addresses \"some of the more frightening\" aspects of racism. While delighted, she says she is still pinching herself to make sure she's not dreaming and has actually won a new home. \"I saw this come up and I was a little bit skeptical as it seemed a bit too crazy that they were giving away free houses,\" Rocheteau told CNN. \"(But) I love the house and I'm very excited to actually get there and start living there. Laying the foundations . Write A House is the brainchild of Toby Barlow, a writer and creative director at advertising agency Team Detroit, and Sarah Cox, a writer and journalist originally from New York, who have been collaborating on the idea since 2012. The pair hope not only to improve Detroit's neighborhoods by filling out boarded up properties but to change outside perceptions of life in the city as well. \"As a freelance writer I've found it to be a great place as there is so much space to cover things. You're not living in a city like New York that has so many journalists in every area,\" Cox said. A problem that has arisen due to the comparative lack of storytellers in Detroit, Cox believes, is that negative stereotypes about life in the city have been allowed to flourish. Rocheteau concurs and points out that Detroit has become a metaphor for American industrial decline -- which she describes as wholly unfair. While Detroit has certainly suffered its fair share of hardship, including filing for bankruptcy in 2013, both Rocheteau and Cox say countering the simplistic narrative of a city in ruins is important in providing perspective. \"In Detroit there are so many stories that need to be told. It doesn't matter whether you end up telling them through poetry or fiction ... there's a lot of inspiring people here,\" Cox said. Moving on up . Tackling the many misconceptions surrounding Detroit and focusing on growing as a writer is for the months and years ahead, however. For now, Rocheteau is preparing to move in to her new home on November 1 and is excited to explore her new community. She said she was intrigued by the eclectic cultural mix of the neighborhood's Bangladeshi and Polish immigrant communities when she visited in September as well as the visual art installations that dot the landscape. The house itself is compact, with one bedroom and one bathroom, and was in a state of disrepair when bought at auction for just $1,000 earlier this year. It has since been renovated by local companies employing young apprentices from across Detroit thanks to a $30,000 donation from Team Detroit and $33,000 raised on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo. Write A House's initial success and the positive coverage it has received has also helped attract more donations and sponsors to buy up other houses in the coming months. \"We're planning to do three houses next year,\" Cox said. \"We already own one and are talking about picking up two more.\" She added that since the original crowdfunding campaign \"we have attracted grants ... and we've actually received $100,000 from the Knight Foundation (an organization that seeks to promote journalism and the arts).\" \"Crowdfunding was a great way to make it public and get attention by getting little donations. But the housing renovations are expensive and I believe we'll be getting a mix of different grants and funding in the future.\"\n### Response: ", "target": "Detroit project purchases and renovates foreclosed homes before giving them away to aspiring literary talents .\nFirst house purchased for $1,000 before being renovated and has been given to poet Casey Rocheteau .\nThe aim of the project is to fill in empty homes and boost Detroit's burgeoning literary scene .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given text.\n### Input:(CNN) -- The United States and Germany are sending Patriot missiles and troops to the Turkish border, a warning to Syria's besieged President Bashar al-Assad. The surface-to-air interceptors would be \"dealing with threats that come out of Syria,\" said U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Threats would include Syrian strikes inside Turkey and fighting between the government and rebels that extends into Turkey. Errant Syrian artillery shells struck the Turkish border town of Akcakale and killed five Turkish civilians in October. \"We can't spend a lot of time worrying about whether that pisses off Syria,\" said Panetta after signing the order Friday. He spoke after arriving Friday at Turkey's Incirlik Air Base, a U.S. Air Force installation about 80 miles from Syria's border. Despite the prospect of U.S. missiles on Al-Assad's doorstep and a weakening regime, U.S. intelligence officials said the Syrian leader is showing no signs of giving up. Al-Assad losing control but showing no signs of leaving . The deployment includes two Patriot missile batteries, used solely for defensive purposes, and 400 U.S. troops to operate them. The United States and NATO hope to have them in place by the second week in January, and a military advance team is going in in the next several days, CNN has learned. The moves come a week after NATO foreign ministers approved the deployment of Patriots to protect Turkey against any threats from al-Assad's regime, rapidly weakening by rebel advances. Also Friday, the German parliament approved the deployment of German Patriot anti-aircraft missiles to Turkey, with 461 Bundestag deputies voting in favor of the deployment, 86 against and eight abstentions. The Netherlands have shown willingness to add Patriot batteries, NATO said Friday, to defend Turkey and \"de-escalate the crisis on NATO's southeastern border.\" Patriots are constructed to take out threats from warplanes and tactical ballistic missiles to unmanned aircraft by impacting with them in midair, according to Raytheon Co., which builds them. The U.S. military used to take out Scud missiles during the Iraq war. The United States has accused Damascus of launching Scud-type artillery from the capital at rebels in the country's north. One Washington official said missiles came close to the border of Turkey, a NATO member and staunch U.S. ally. Syria's government called the accusations \"untrue rumors\" Friday, according to state news agency SANA. Damascus accused Turkey and its partners of instigating rumors to make the government look bad internationally. NATO has also said it detected what appeared to be ballistic missile launches within Syria and condemned their possible use as \"utter disregard for the lives of the Syrian people.\" Turkey and NATO insist the Patriot system would be used only for defense. U.S. official: Syria uses Scud missiles against rebels . Al-Assad is 'weakening' Al-Assad's departure is the dream of his opponents. U.S. officials said the Syrian president's control is crumbling at an accelerating pace . \"It's at its lowest point yet,\" said one senior US official with direct knowledge of the latest assessments. U.S. intelligence believes the decline has accelerated in recent weeks. \"The trend is moving more rapidly than it has in the past.\" The officials agreed to talk on the condition their names not be used because they were not authorized to discuss the information with the media. U.S. officials said they believe al-Assad is still controlling some of his military forces and commanders. He and his top advisers are showing less ability to maintain control than they did six to eight months ago. \"There has been a strongly downward steady progression\" in al-Assad's grip on power,\" said the senior U.S. official . The United States believes \"the wall around him is slowly coming down,\" said the senior official of the strong inner circle around the Syrian president. \"We are saying there are indicators there is weakening around Assad.\" But there is no indication al-Assad is making plans to step down, the senior official and other administration officials said. Syrian regime approaching collapse, NATO chief says . A second official said al-Assad and his commanders appear to be fully aware the opposition has made significant military gains in recent weeks and that al-Assad \"is not out of it\" in his understanding of the current situation. Even with the rebel advances, loyalists in the Syrian military appear to be holding firm. Much of the anti-Assad fighting force includes military defectors. There are signs that military defections at the commander level are slowing though the U.S. analysts are not sure why, the second U.S. official said. \"There is still regime control over the military despite the fact they recognize the opposition force has improved,\" said the second U.S. official said. Syrian rebels, government battle . The Syrian civil war started in March 2011 when a government crackdown on civilian demonstrators morphed into a fight between the regime and rebels. The conflict has seized the attention of world powers for months because of the relentless brutality and the specter of the Syrian government mulling the use of chemical weapons. The war has a proxy element, with Sunni countries such as Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia backing the rebels and Shiite Iran backing the Alawite regime. The Alawite faith is an offshoot of Shiism. More than 40,000 people have died in the war. The United Nations said on Friday that many Syrians will continue to be killed and maimed after the war ends because of deadly explosives placed in residential areas across the country. The violence continued Friday, with at least 32 deaths recorded by the opposition Local Coordination Committees said.

{"source": "### Instruction:Read the following passage and summarize it.\n### Input:(CNN) -- Politics abhors a vacuum, and the \"Bridgegate scandal\" engulfing Chris Christie has severely compromised the New Jersey governor's ability to launch a campaign for president, opening a space that Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, seems likely to fill. \"The idea that he's the prohibitive front-runner is over\" is how one Republican strategist described Christie's plight to the conservative National Review. At stake is the future of the Republican Party, which has been divided for several years by a simmering fight between factions -- ultra-conservative Tea Party activists and more moderate establishment figures who control key party offices. Christie and Bush are both frequently mentioned as mainstream candidates that the establishment would like to see run in 2016. But Christie's status as a party favorite has faltered, while Bush appears to be on the rise. The contrast was on display at Saturday's White House Correspondents' Dinner, the high-profile, televised black-tie event in which the nation's media and political elites take satirical jabs at one another. Nobody got rougher treatment from the podium than Christie, especially from comedian Joel McHale, the evening's emcee. \"I promise that tonight will be both amusing and over quickly -- just like Chris Christie' s presidential bid,\" quipped McHale, who later harped on the apparently politically motivated traffic tie-up near the George Washington Bridge that has led to the firing and resignation of top Christie aides. \"Finally, a politician willing to stand up to America's commuters,\" deadpanned McHale. Bush, by contrast, escaped with a passing mention as a top presidential contender. Christie's bad news shows up in polls that can't be dismissed as a joke. In a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll of all Americans, Bush ranked at the top of a list of Republican presidential contenders with a 14% showing; Christie's was 10%. A Fox News poll taken last month shows that among Republicans, Bush has a 52% approval rating compared with Christie's 46%. After talking with more than 24 top Republican donors, reporters from The New York Times concluded in a recent article that \"some of them are signaling to Mr. Christie's camp that, should Mr. Bush enter the race, their first loyalty would be to him, not to Mr. Christie.\" That's a sea change from recent years, when Christie, a prodigious fund-raiser, wielded tight control over his New Jersey donors. According to Washington Post commentator Dan Balz, when candidate Mitt Romney came seeking support, in 2011, Christie said he told him: \"If you raise money in New Jersey in any kind of aggressive, organized way, it's going to make it very unlikely that I'll be able to support you.\" Things have changed. With Christie hemorrhaging support, a number of New Jersey heavy hitters are now openly agonizing over whether to stick with Christie or invest in a Bush candidacy. Bush brings multiple advantages: Having a father and brother who were presidents means there are legions of Republicans, across multiple generations, who owe personal and political loyalty to the closest thing the GOP has to a royal family. On the hot-button issue of immigration reform, Bush has staked out an independent position, calling on Republicans to move away from \"harsh rhetoric\" on the issue and co-authoring a book on the subject -- an implicit recognition that winning the White House in 2016 will require support from Latinos and other pro-immigration voters. Most importantly, Bush remains untouched by scandal, while Christie must cope with a scandal that just won't go away. Last week, an attorney for David Samson, a close adviser and mentor of Christie's, announced that Samson will not answer subpoenas from a state legislative committee investigating Bridgegate, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. It's another crippling blow to Christie's presidential hopes. Samson, named by Christie to serve as chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, oversaw the multibillion-dollar agency that runs the George Washington Bridge until he was forced to resign as the scandal unfolded. Samson is the most prominent among several Christie aides who have quit or been fired and have now lawyered up. That means we'll see court fights around memos, meetings and other crucial evidence for months to come -- months during which Christie's nascent candidacy will continue to decline, leaving Bush looking like the white knight for which the Republican establishment has been waiting.\n### Response:", "target": "Errol Louis: \"Bridgegate\" has hurt Christie's chances, cleared way for Jeb Bush in 2016 .\nHe says Christie and rising Bush both seen as moderates in fractured GOP .\nHe says polls favor Bush over Christie and donors leaning toward ex-Florida governor .\nLouis: Bush faces no scandal, can appeal to Latinos on immigration issues .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What are the central ideas presented?(CNN)  -- Roger Federer has been hit with a $1,500 fine for swearing at the umpire during his shock U.S. Open final defeat to Juan Martin Del Potro. Federer argues with umpire Jake Garner during his five-set defeat to Del Potro. The world number one became embroiled in an argument with Jake Garner at the end of the second set after complaining Del Potro was taking too long to decide whether or not to make challenges. The Argentine successfully overturned an \"out\" call shortly before Federer's outburst, a point that led to him breaking serve and eventually taking the set. During the exchange Federer was picked up on microphones telling Garner: \"Don't tell me when to be quiet, okay? When I want to talk, I'll talk.\" Del Potro went on to claim his first grand slam, ending Federer's five-year unbeaten run at Flushing Meadows and denying the Swiss maestro a 16th grand slam title. Federer's fine pales in comparison to the one meted out to Serena Williams, who was docked $10,000 for an altercation with a line judge at the climax of her semifinal with eventual winner Kim Clijsters. Williams reacted angrily after being called for a foot fault, and unleashed a torrent of abuse at the official, who reported the exchange to umpire Louise Engzell. The resulting penalty point for a code violation handed the match to Clijsters. Williams later apologized for the incident. She was also fined $500 for racket abuse in the same encounter. Over $31,000 in fines were handed out in the final grand slam of the season with Daniel Nestor, from Canada, forced to pay $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct towards a fan he confronted. Vera Zvonareva of Russia and Austria's Daniel Koellerer were also fined $1,500 for audible obscenities.

{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.(CNN) -- A plan to burn an effigy of Lance Armstrong -- and adorn it with references to Jimmy Savile, the British broadcaster accused of child sex offenses -- has caused outrage. The residents of an English town want to set ablaze a giant likeness of the cyclist this weekend as part of an annual ritual that focuses on popular hate-figures. The nine-meter high structure has around its neck a medal referencing Jimmy Savile, who died a year ago at the age of 84 and is now the center an investigation into hundreds of allegations of child sex abuse. The effigy, organized by the Edenbridge Bonfire Society, has already been criticized by members of the public ahead of the planned November 5 burning. \"Shame on you for selecting Lance Armstrong as your guy; who has personally raised over $500 million for cancer charities,\" read a comment from one visitor to the society's website on Thursday. \"What message are you trying to project? If the organizing committee had any morals or backbone you would scrap this decision and to further associate him with Jimmy Savile is disgraceful.\" Lance Armstrong's demise: How an all-American hero fell to earth . Annual bonfire celebrations and fireworks displays are held across Britain on November 5 to mark a failed attempt by Guy Fawkes and others to blow up the houses of parliament and kill King James I in 1605. Fawkes was hanged as punishment for his part in the \"gunpowder plot.\" Where once the November 5 ritual of burning effigies reflected political turmoil and dissension among the population, now it has become a family event controlled by strict rules and regulations -- but one where the wry British sense of mischief still emerges, making targets of establishment figures. Bonfires are traditionally decorated with a stuffed \"Guy,\" but Edenbridge Bonfire Society has gained a reputation for using celebrities instead. In 2011 it was controversial Manchester City soccer star Mario Balotelli, who caused a fire by setting off fireworks in his own home despite being the face of a firework safety campaign. Other celebrity \"victims\" have included former British prime minister Tony Blair, ex-French president Jacques Chirac and deceased Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. This year it is a yellow-jersey clad Armstrong holding a sign saying: \"For Sale Racing Bike, No Longer Required.\" The effigy also has a medal reading \"Jim Fixed It For Me\" -- a reference to one of the television shows formerly hosted by Savile. Lance Armstrong's epic downfall . Another comment on the Edenbridge society's website read: \"Burning an effigy of a living person is disgraceful and wrong! I hope that all good minded people will condemn these actions. English people are today being broadcast in the news worldwide as effigy burners. \"These actions providing temporary laughs to a small minded mob will potentially have longer lasting negative repercussions around the world.\" Another said: \"Lance Armstrong is 2 people a sportsman and a Cancer crusader whose efforts have helped thousands of people around the world. To pair him up with a child sex offender is unjust!\" Many societies similar to the body in Edenbridge exist across the county of Kent. The annual displays commemorate both Guy Fawkes and the deaths of 17 Protestant martyrs, known as \"The Sussex Martyrs,\" between 1555 and 1557. The Edenbridge society said it had considered depicting Savile, British chancellor George Osbourne or extradited Muslim cleric Abu Hamza. \"We had a shortlist which included Jimmy Savile but it was decided it would not be nice to use him as a lot of children attend the bonfire and they might start asking their parents questions,\" its co-ordinator Charles Laver told the UK Press Association. \"Then we had George Osborne but he hasn't really got a face that everyone knows and he's just a chap in a suit. We felt he would be a bit boring. \"We started to do Abu Hamza but then we decided we weren't entirely happy to do him, so Lance Armstrong came out of the woodwork. He's better because he's brighter ... We're very pleased with it.\" Meanwhile, the fallout from the Armstrong doping scandal -- which led to the American being stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and told to pay back millions of dollars in prize money and sponsorships -- continues in the world of cycling. The International Olympic Committee announced Thursday that it will investigate whether to strip the 41-year-old of the bronze medal he won at the 2000 Sydney Games. One of Armstrong's former teammates, Australian Matt White, was forced off the Orica-GreenEDGE team after admitting to using performance-enhancing substances during his professional career. White rode on Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service team between 2001 and 2003. His confession is the latest in a series of admissions from pros within the sport. Team Sky, which boasts 2012 Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins among its ranks, parted company with team director Steven de Jongh after the Dutchman admitted to taking banned substances during his 14-year career. American coach Bobby Julich also left the British team last week after coming clean regarding past doping offenses.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?\n### Input :(CNN) -- The urban dictionary defines \"cheech\" as a verb used among physicians in training that refers to the act of ordering every conceivable radiological and laboratory test for a patient, often to diagnose a condition that once diagnosed is untreatable. Thirty years ago, the macabre joke during my three-month stint as an intern in the medical ICU was first cheech, then death. I remember sitting at the bedside of a frail, older woman with dementia dying of septic shock. A litany of subspecialists had rounded earlier in the day, but no one said what was so obvious. She was dying. Instead, I sat at her bedside at 4:30 a.m. watching the sun rise over Narragansett Bay, increasing vasopressors to try to maintain her blood pressure. Instead of being surrounded by her family and loved ones, the only person at her bedside was an exhausted intern who had never met the woman in bed No. 2 until the night before. This was simply wrong. Why were we rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic instead of ensuring that her death was peaceful and that she was surrounded by her family? Intensive Care Units save some patients and play an important role in our health care system. But the overarching concern is, \"Are we talking to frail, older patients and their families at the right time about when to stop (or avoid) ICU care and recurrent hospitalizations?\" Decisions about hospitalizations and ICU admission must weigh the quality vs. the quantity of life. Opinion: End-of-life planning eases suffering . These decisions must reflect a patient's informed wishes and goals for care, be based on what the patient and/or family understand about the medical condition -- their hopes and goals -- and educate them about the prognosis and treatment options to arrive at a care plan that honors realistic patient goals of care. Our research published in the February 8 edition of JAMA finds that hospice is now part of mainstream medical care, with nearly half of older Medicare beneficiaries receiving hospice services. However, that's only half the story. More than a quarter (28.4%) of these people had the benefit of hospice for three days or less, and nearly half (40.3%) were in an ICU immediately before. Indeed, contrasting end of life care in 2000 vs. 2009, in spite of a doubling of hospice use, we found more ICU care, more repeat hospitalizations and more patient transfers from hospital to another health care setting in the last three days of life. Does this pattern of care reflect the informed wishes of dying patients and their families? Our research does not provide the answer to this important question. But it is something we really need to know. On the face of it, our research findings should not be surprising. You get what you pay for. All the financial incentives in fee-for-service Medicare are aligned to induce more hospitalizations, more ICU care and late hospice referrals. As we try to reform our health care system to provide care that is patient centered and care that improves the health of our population, we need to do a better job of paying for quality rather than simply paying for another day in the ICU, particularly if it does not change the inevitable. Yet during the debate over health-care reform, a proposal to pay health-care providers for advance care planning was eliminated from the legislation based on the mistaken argument that promoting shared decision making with the goals of honoring patient wishes was equivalent to creating a \"death panel.\" The key is that decisions be based upon discussions that weigh the quantity vs. the quality of life reflect informed patient preferences. The evidence to date suggests we are falling short of that goal. We've previously shown that 11.6% of family members felt pressured by a physician to put a feeding tube in a dying patient with advanced dementia, and about 10% reported that no one discussed that decision with them. A recent study of two ICUs that differed on the aggressiveness of care provided found contrasting decision-making styles: a futility based decision-making process where one talks to the patient only when death is certain in the aggressive ICU vs. a shared decision making model where physicians work with patients and families early in the ICU stay to arrive at a decision that is consistent with the patient's prognosis and goals of care in the ICU. We must have publicly reported data on the degree in which our health care system delivers on the promise of patient centered care -- that health care providers are informing patients and their families of the expected prognosis and treatment options, helping them in making these difficult decisions, and that patients are provided the right care at the right time, in the right place, and consistent with their informed wishes. We must hold our health care system accountable to the goal that medical decisions should reflect patient informed goals and values.

Teno .\n### Response: ", "target": "Joan Teno asks: Why do doctors continue to test and treat patients who are clearly dying?\nShe says instead they should be helping very sick patients weigh quality of life against quantity .\nTeno: Hospice care doubles, but patients still in ICU until last 3 days of life.

{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given text.(CNN) -- British police were told in March this year that missing girl Madeleine McCann may have been kidnapped by a pedophile ring which followed her three days before her abduction, according to reports. Madeleine McCann went missing in May 2007 after being left at a holiday apartment in the Algarve region. Britain's Daily Telegraph and The Sun newspapers both reported Thursday that an email released this week as part of the documents compiled by the Portuguese investigators probing Madeleine's disappearance revealed the connection to the ring. Madeleine was 3 when she disappeared May 3, 2007, while she was on holiday with her family at the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz. Her disappearance prompted headlines worldwide. According to the newspapers, the email was sent on March 4 by a London-based Metropolitan Police intelligence officer to Leicestershire police -- Madeleine's home county -- who then forwarded it on to investigators in Portugal more than a month later. In the email, which both newspapers printed a copy of, the officer writes that \"intelligence suggests that a pedophile ring in Belgium made an order for a young girl three days before Madeleine McCann was taken. \"Somebody connected to this group saw Maddie, took a photograph of her and sent it to Belgium. The purchaser agreed the girl was suitable and Maddie was taken,\" the officer wrote. The Daily Telegraph reported the Portuguese police then asked Interpol to investigate. However, nothing appears to have come of the lead.  Watch how Madeleine McCann may have been abducted to order \u00bb . Belgium has already featured in the case, with a reported sighting on the Dutch/Belgian border last August already discounted. The case files, released by the Portuguese investigators this week after they shelved the investigation for lack of evidence last month, have provided a raft of leads for the media to report. On Tuesday, the documents revealed a previously undisclosed sighting of Madeleine in the Netherlands shortly after her disappearance. The possible sighting of Madeleine in May 2007 stemmed from a report by a Dutch shopkeeper, who told authorities she encountered a little girl in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. She said the child identified herself as Maddie and said she was taken from her mother while on holiday. \"I start to ask where her mommy was,\" Anna Stam said. \"She couldn't tell me that. I wanted to give her a balloon, but she didn't want that. She only wants her mommy, she said. And she said that these people took her from her mommy.\" At one point, authorities had named the girl's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, as \"arguidos,\" or suspects, along with a British man living in Portugal, Robert Murat. But a spokesman for the Portuguese public prosecutor's office said authorities found no evidence of involvement by any of the three and were no longer considering them \"arguidos.\" After closing the case, police turned their case file -- containing up to 30,000 pages -- over to attorneys and private investigators working for the McCanns. The McCanns have vowed to keep searching for their daughter. .\n### Response:", "target": "Portuguese police case file reveal more leads in Madeleine McCann disappearance .\nEmail from British police suggests Madeleine taken by pedophile ring .\nRing followed three-year-old girl before snatching her, reports claim .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you briefly describe the text?(CNN) -- China's Shenzhou-9 spacecraft returned to Earth on Friday, completing an ambitious mission that notched up a series of breakthroughs for the country, including putting its first woman in orbit. Shenzhou-9 successfully carried out a manned space docking last week, making China the third country to complete such a feat after the United States and Russia. Hanging from a parachute, the capsule floated back down to Earth on Friday, bumping down on the arid terrain of Inner Mongolia and rolling onto its side. Support teams raced on foot and in vehicles to where the capsule lay to coordinate the three-person crew's exit from the spacecraft. After an hour of preparation work in and around the capsule, the crew members emerged one by one, smiling and waving. They were helped into chairs, as their bodies were still adapting to the earth's gravity after nearly two weeks of weightlessness. Jing Haipeng came out first to applause from the ground staff. He was followed by Liu Wang. There was then a pause before the female crew member, Liu Yang, made her way out. The three sat in a row in front of the capsule as Chinese flags rippled in the wind behind them. Still fully dressed in their spacesuits, they joined hands and were each handed a bouquet of flowers. China has made rapid, steady strides in developing its space program over the past decade, such as sending its first astronaut into space, completing its first spacewalk and launching two lunar orbiters. It has big aspirations for the program and hopes to build a space station and conduct a manned mission to the moon. Shenzhou-9 docked with the orbiting Tiangong-1 space laboratory last week. Tiangong-1, a prototype for a full-fledged space station, was launched into space in September. The crew of Shenzhou-9 followed that feat by executing a manual docking with Tiangong-1 on Sunday. Mastering the technique of joining spacecraft together manually is considered an crucial step toward China's goal of building a space station in 2020. Previously, the docking had been done by remote control from the ground. The endeavors have been a source of pride for China and coincided with the record-setting descent of a Chinese manned submersible vehicle 7,020 meters into the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean. They could help bolster support for the Chinese Communist Party as it undergoes a once-in-a-decade leadership transition later this year and deal with the fallout from the dramatic downfall of Bo Xilai, one of the country's most prominent politicians.

{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.(CNN) -- While following the horrific events at the Washington Navy Yard, I was struck by something beyond the tragic developments. It was the number of women in law enforcement who were directing the response to those events, and who were center-stage -- at press conferences, in news articles and on my TV screen \u00e2\u20ac\u201d as they updated the public. They included Cathy Lanier, chief of District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department; Valerie Parlave, assistant director in charge, FBI's Washington Field Office; Teresa Chambers, chief of the United States Park Police and they have largely been the face of officialdom in the Navy Yard shootings. The gender of these women so prominent in handling the unfolding crisis has gone unmentioned \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and this alone is worthy of note, considering the history of women in law enforcement, long a male-dominated profession. These women are simply law enforcement leaders doing the jobs they were hired to do. And there are more: Women also head the U.S. Marshal's Service, the Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration and Amtrak Police Department. This kind of representation is relatively new. Women have worked in law enforcement since the 19th century. But until the 1970s, they were mainly confined to clerical jobs or dispatch. Affirmative action opened doors, but just a crack. Women back then still held only 2% of total police force jobs. Today, FBI figures put the total number of women in law enforcement at around 12% of the nation's roughly 700,000 police officers -- with representation highest in big city departments, where females can account for as many as one in four. In wasn't until 1985 that America saw a major city swear in its first female police chief, when Penny Harrington took the job in Portland, Oregon. Since then, the chief has been addressed as \"ma'am\" in Boston, San Francisco, Milwaukee, Detroit, Orlando, Houston, Tampa and dozens of smaller cities. The most recent figures from the National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives indicate there are approximately 220 female police chiefs across the country. The rise to top leadership positions in law enforcement bumps up against the same barriers as other professions, of course. Female officers call it the \"brass ceiling.\" (aka \"the bulletproof glass ceiling\"). The pioneering chief Harrington (who resigned after a rough tenure) talked about that in an interview in Next Women Business Magazine. Harrington, founder of the National Center for Women and Policing, said: \"Unfortunately, the obstacles have not changed much since I started in 1964. The culture still values physical strength and devalues reasoning and negotiating skills.\" She also said that because so many officers start in the military, \"they bring those rigid attitudes with them.\" She added, however, that there are \"many wonderful men in law enforcement who are supportive of women, and who are excellent community officers.\" D.C. Chief Lanier agreed that the march to the top still has pitfalls. She told USAToday last month: \"There is a segment of the population that is still watching, waiting and hoping that we don't do well.\" Still, she cites accomplishments in the 40 years since women were allowed to join men in patrol cars. Women represent 22% of the D.C. police force. \"Women (officers) are paying attention to what's happening in the top ranks. ... I think, overall, people are starting to appreciate these changes.\" There is clearly room to improve, but as the women handling the Washington Navy Yard crisis so powerfully show, the brass ceiling -- like the glass ceiling -- has begun to crack.

Jesse Jackson ended a trip to the Ivory Coast on Friday, after he spoke to leaders from the nation's political parties and was honored as a prince by a tribe in the West African nation. Jesse Jackson says ceremony to name him a prince of the Agni people was \"very exciting.\" Jackson said he met with President Laurent Gbagbo and leading members of two opposition parties, Henri Konan Bedie and Alassane Ouattara. Bedie is a former president of the nation and Ouattara is a former prime minister. Jackson said his mission was not to endorse a candidate, \"but a process.\" \"I wanted the three of them to agree ... [to] campaign vigorously ... not to create divisive language, to each agree to support the winner, [and] end the [U.N.] sanctions,\" he said. \"I think there's a common agreement on these points. This country has so much to offer the world and Africa.\" The United Nations imposed sanctions on the nation in 2004, among them, a ban on arms and diamond trades, a travel ban and asset freezes for some individuals. The sanctions, renewed last year, are in effect until October 29. Earlier in Jackson's trip, Amon N'Douffou V, king of the Krindjabo kingdom, named Jackson a prince of the Agni people, news reports said. Jackson said it was a \"very exciting ceremony.\" Jackson's wife, Jacqueline, suffered a broken leg during the trip when a stage she and her husband were on collapsed, Jackson told CNN in a telephone interview. \"We had excellent medical care,\" the pastor said, adding that the collapse was \"not the fault of the organizers,\" but that too many people had gathered on the stage. Official news agency Agence Ivoirienne de Presse reported that the stage collapse occurred in a sports complex in Yopougon, north of Abidjan. A doctor was to accompany them on their Friday night flight back to the United States, Jackson said. The coming elections in the Ivory Coast are being closely watched by U.N. officials.

Ai told CNN that if the tax charge went unpaid then his wife, the legal representative of Fake Cultural Ltd., would have been sent to jail. When news of the tax charges broke earlier this month, there was a huge outpouring of donations from fellow activists and supporters wanting to ease the 15 million yuan ($2.3 million) debt. Ai told CNN that the donations grew to more than 9 million yuan, but he only used a portion of it for this payment, which he hopes will give him the right to an administrative review. Speaking to CNN by phone Tuesday, Ai said he is not optimistic about the possible results of any review. \"We don't expect any justice to come after the administrative review because there was no justice from the beginning when I was taken away,\" he said, referring to his imprisonment in April. The artist was detained on allegations of tax evasion. However, his family and human rights advocates believe that the real reason for his imprisonment is his criticism of the Chinese government. Ai was released on bail in June for his good attitude and medical concerns, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. Local authorities held a closed hearing in July on the tax evasion allegations, despite demands for an open hearing from Ai and the company's lawyers. According to the artist, authorities also declined their demand to publish the accounting records and other evidence that lead to the tax evasion charge. Ai told CNN earlier this month he was initially detained and imprisoned on charges of \"subversion of state power,\" but upon his release the charge was changed to tax evasion. \"This is against judicial law, and is unethical. How can a country use this way to try to silence dissidents?\" he asked. \"China always uses tax issues to cover up political issues.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?\n### Input: (CNN) -- Mario Balotelli didn't score but, once again, it was still all about him. The Italian striker made his much anticipated reintroduction into English soccer Sunday when he started for Liverpool against Tottenham Hotspur. Liverpool ran out comfortable 3-0 winners with goals from Raheem Sterling, Steven Gerrard and new signing Alberto Moreno. But before, during and after the game, all eyes were on the mercurial Balotelli, who showed flashes of both his brilliance and profligacy. On any other day he might have had a hat trick, but he missed his three clear cut chances in the first half. Rodgers impressed . Yet Balotelli's work rate and approach play on and off the ball impressed his new coach Brendan Rodgers. \"He is a good man and I think if you take away the circus around him, and the circus he invites himself sometimes, control the background noise and get him focused on his football, he'll make mistakes ... but he's going to be a real handful for defenders,\" Rodgers said after the game. Rodgers also revealed that Balotelli had never defended at a corner before coming to Liverpool. \"For the first time in his life he marked at a corner,\" Rodgers revealed. \"Serious. International player, won three titles, and we were doing corners and I said, 'are you picking up [opposition players] at the corners'. He said: 'I don't mark at corners.' You do now.\" It was almost a dream debut for Balotelli but he managed to head the ball straight at Hugo Lloris in the Tottenham goal. But Rodgers' new system, with Balotelli and Daniel Sturridge up front and Raheem Sterling playing behind, paid dividends. In fact it was Sterling who broke the deadlock when he scored at the near post following a Jordan Henderson cross from the right hand side. A Steven Gerrard penalty and a stunning Alberto Moreno strike made sure of the points and ensured Balotelli's return to English football was a winning one. Arsenal stutter . Later in the day Arsenal continued their indifferent Premier League form with a 1-1 draw against Leicester City. With the transfer window about to shut, Arsenal's depth of forward options had been under scrutiny before the game. But it was one of coach Arsene Wenger's big summer signings, Alexis Sanchez, who put Arsenal ahead before Leicester City equalized through a Leo Ulloa header. Arsenal had 24 chances during the match but couldn't break down a team who were promoted from English soccer's second tier last season. \"Tough, tough,\" Wenger told Sky Sports after the draw. \"A draw was fair. We didn't play well enough. We lacked a bit of creativity. We've had two tough weeks, three away games. It is not an excuse, but we are a bit jaded.

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?In the summer of 2007, mobile health (mHealth) was a field in its infancy. Monsoon season in Bangladesh, however, was in full swing, and with it came an enormous spike in cholera cases. I was working at a diarrheal disease hospital in the capital, Dhaka, at the time. More than 1,000 patients were rushed to the hospital on stretchers every day, most admitted to the makeshift wards of canvas tents that sprawled over parking lots and spilled into the streets. It was there that I saw my first patient die. He was a 53-year-old male, a husband and a father, emaciated and severely dehydrated. I remember struggling to place an IV into his cephalic vein, shuddering at the words repeating in my mind. He looks like a corpse. In 10 minutes he passed away, and we learned that his family had brought him on a three-day journey to the capital for treatment. They were wholly unaware that a satellite clinic had been deployed no more than 20 minutes away from their home. This was an enormous tragedy, and for years I would think about how it could have been prevented. It turned out that a solution was in place and waiting to be discovered.  The key is to leverage the unprecedented communication boom that's happening today. Health: Tracking your body with technology . It is easy to forget that the mobile revolution has been a global phenomenon. Of the more than 6 billion cell phone subscriptions worldwide, 76% are in developing countries. From rural Malawi to bustling Hyderabad, cell phone coverage and penetrance have become surprisingly advanced. When I saw the potential of how we can radically transform the way we deliver health care to underserved populations, I co-founded Medic Mobile in the hopes of building new models of health care support networks from simple, SMS-based platforms. This direction opened the gateway to establishing emergency triage systems, sending medication adherence reminders, enabling home-based antenatal care, tracking community immunization and dispatching mass announcements detailing satellite clinic schedules and locations. Handheld device that saves lives . For example, in Kurnool, India, where first-year childhood vaccination rates have lingered in the 60th percentile, we worked with a local immunization center to design a mobile-based reminder system for parents. Local health workers enrolled newly pregnant women in our records and took down their cell phone number. Once the system was updated with an infant's birth date, it would automatically schedule SMS reminders to be sent to the family when it was time for a vaccination. The system also sent periodic educational messages about the importance of complete immunization and the diseases they protected against. After six months of piloting this intervention, we were already seeing dramatic improvements in vaccination rates. Mothers walked into the clinic grinning, baby in one hand, cell phone in the other. While I am focused on helping people in the developing countries, I am keenly aware that mobile health care innovations also impact people close to home. Working at Stanford hospitals, I can attest to the luxury of checking my patients' vital signs while lying in bed, or test driving in-house communication systems for consultations, which utilize smartphones rather than 1980's-era pagers. Health: Your smartphone is a pain in the neck . Mobile health development in the United States means innovating with the newest technologies, from diabetes management apps to miniature diagnostic devices, all aiming to capitalize on the potential of the latest tablets and smartphones. The possibilities are truly mind-blowing. Interestingly, U.S.-based mobile health care innovations can serve as testing beds for tools that will likely be deployed in Africa, Central and South America, or Southeast Asia in the coming years. And many SMS-based innovations gaining prominence abroad might return to the developed world as cost-effective methods of addressing fundamental problems in our overburdened health care system. I like to think that the paths of innovation are convergent. Imagine a world where, whether you're sporting an iPhone 5 or a Nokia 3100, you can remotely access your medical information, reschedule doctors' appointments, monitor loved ones' vital signs, receive secure lab results, compete for \"best blood sugar control,\" manage tailored medication reminders, etc. That day may not be that far off.\n### Response :", "target": "Many of the 6 billion wireless subscriptions worldwide are in developing countries .\nNadim Mahmud: Mobile tech can radically transform the way we deliver health care .\nHe says doctors can easily send reminders to patients about medication, vaccination .\nMahmud: Mobile health care innovations in the U.S. are mind-blowing .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

A Belgian-based nonprofit has used the species to diagnose tuberculosis in patients by having the rats smell saliva samples\u2014a cheaper and faster way than typical lab tests. The same organization, called APOPO, also trained rats to recognize buried TNT so they can detect land mines in former war zones. So far, the rats have found 1,500 land mines in Africa and Southeast Asia. \n  \n Now the U.S. federal agency is spending $100,000 on a pilot project in Tanzania to train the rats to detect the scales of one of the most trafficked animals on the planet\u2014the pangolin. \n  \n If the project proves promising, the grant would be \u201cthe first phase of a much larger project to mainstream rats as an innovative tool in combating illegal wildlife trade,\u201d according to a Fish and Wildlife Service report.

Most of the grant money is focused on deterring illegal trade in the endangered pangolin; more than 1 million of the scaly anteaters have been killed for body parts over the past decade. Their scales are used in traditional Asian medicines, and their meat is considered a delicacy. \n  \n \u201cThese grants provide much needed resources to support projects on the ground where wildlife trafficking is decimating some of the Earth\u2019s most cherished and most unusual species,\u201d Dan Ashe, Fish and Wildlife Service director, said in a statement. \u201cThese grant recipients are using pioneering approaches to address the illegal wildlife trade in the places where it starts and where demand for wildlife products feeds the criminal supply chain of illegal goods.\u201d \n  \n While the rats could become key to the U.S.\u2019 efforts to halt international wildlife trafficking, the species most likely won\u2019t be coming to America for a victory parade. The rats, also known as Gambian pouched rats, were once imported to the U.S. as an exotic pet. But in the 1990s, a pet breeder released half a dozen rats onto Grassy Key, an island in the middle of the Florida Keys. The rats, capable of growing three feet long and weighing up to nine pounds, quickly began reproducing, and wildlife officials have been trying to eradicate the species ever since. ||||| Elite rat team to begin by spotting illegal shipments of pangolins, the world\u2019s most trafficked animal, at ports in Tanzania \n  \n The US government will fund the training of a team of giant rats to combat illegal wildlife trafficking in Africa. \n  \n An elite group of African giant pouched rats will be used at ports, initially in Tanzania, to detect illegal shipments of pangolins \u2013 the world\u2019s most trafficked animal, which has been pushed towards extinction due to the trade in its scales and skins \u2013 as well as hardwood timber. \n  \n The US Fish & Wildlife Service is spending $100,000 on a pilot project that will train rats to detect the illegal items and learn to communicate this to their human handlers.

Now the US Fish & Wildlife Service is directing a $100,000 grant toward a pilot project in Tanzania to help sniff out illegally trafficked pangolins, reports the Guardian.

The endangered pangolin is the most trafficked animal in the world, hunted for its meat and scales, which are considered medicinal in parts of Asia.

That said, a new acquisition finalized and announced this morning will help the Fort Wayne company meet the unprecedented demand. \n  \n Hoffmaster Group, Inc., a leading U.S. manufacturer of premium disposable tableware, acquired Aardvark Straws, owned by Precision Products Group, Inc., Monday morning. \n  \n Though based in Wisconsin, Hoffmaster will keep manufacturing operations for Aardvark at its Northeast Indiana facility along with its employees. It is unclear at this time the monetary amount for which Aardvark was acquired. \n  \n \"In the coming months, we will aggressively ramp up Aardvark's manufacturing capacity to meet the rapidly accelerating demand for paper straws...\" President of Hoffmaster's foodservice division Andy Romjue said in a release. \"We are committed to being a reliable supply source for paper drinking straws in the foodservice market.\" \n  \n Within the last year, cities such as San Francisco, Seattle, Fort Myers, Fla, Malibu, Calif. and Vancouver have banned the use of plastic straws as others \u2014 such as New York \u2014 are moving in that direction. Many notable brands, including Starbucks, American Airlines and Disney, have also announced that they will eliminate plastic straws from their establishments in the coming years. \n  \n Aardvark came onto the scene in 2007 as the anti-plastic movement began to emerge. In the 10 years since reintroduction, the company has seen year-over-year growth, according to David Rhodes, the company's global business director. This last year's growth, however, is beyond anything the company could have expected: 5,000 percent. \n  \n Although no specifics could be provided, a spokeswoman for Aardvark told IndyStar that the company is talking to and potentially working with all major players and brands that are moving away from plastic straws and looking for alternatives. \n  \n Buy Photo Bur Burger recently made the switch to paper straws, which are more environmentally friendly than traditional plastic straws, seen here on the restaurant's bar, on Massachusetts Avenue in Indianapolis, Thursday, June 21, 2018.

(Photo: Jenna Watson/IndyStar) \n  \n This acquisition, according to Hoffmaster, will provide Aardvark with the necessary resources to fulfill orders and meet that demand. There currently is a several month lead time for orders depending on their size. \n  \n Hoffmaster has a 6- to 9-month plan for expansion and ramping up Aardvark's production, according to Sammi Coppedge with Dittoe Public Relations, representing the paper straw company. That said, Hoffmaster will keep the product as it is \u2014 as the straw's unique formula is what sets it apart from competitors and a large part of what caught Hoffmaster's eye. \n  \n Aardvark's paper straws do not disintegrate or get soggy when in drinks and are naturally degradable, compostable and FDA compliant. Recent reports have suggested that there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean, by volume, by 2050, making plastic pollution one of the most daunting environmental challenges of our time. \n  \n In the US alone, we use 500 million plastic straws.

A reader reported that a man who was with her got out of the car and went inside the restaurant to pick up a take-out order. Another man was in the back seat of her black Mercedes. Snyderman had sunglasses on and had her hair pulled back, the reader said. \n  \n An American freelance cameraman working with Snyderman in Liberia last week tested positive for Ebola. Snyderman, a resident of Princeton, was flown back to the United States with a crew member on a private charter flight this weekend. Snyderman and her crew were going to be placed under voluntary quarantine for 21 days as a precaution, NBC News President Deborah Turness announced in a written statement on Oct. 3 (see the letter below). NBC said the group would be closely monitored and was showing no symptoms or warning signs of Ebola. \n  \n On Tuesday, NBC News President Deborah Turness said in a statement sent to staff members that Snyderman and her crew were doing well and in good health. \u201cWhile they are deemed to be at low risk, we have agreed with state and local health authorities that our team will not come to work, and they will stay at home taking their temperatures twice daily and staying in touch with the local health authorities for the remainder of the recommended 21-day period,\u201d Turness said. \n  \n Snyderman is not under any kind of mandatory quarantine order by the CDC or the state because she is at a very low risk of contracting Ebola.

The cameraman, who is also a writer, came down with symptoms on Oct. 1. He felt tired and achy, and was running a slight fever. He immediately quarantined himself and sought medical advice. He tested positive for the Ebola virus about 12 hours later. He is the fourth American to have contracted Ebola in Liberia. He has been working in Liberia on various projects for the past three years. He is being flown back to the United States for treatment at a medical center that is equipped to handle Ebola patients. Two American aid workers were infected in July while working for Samaritan\u2019s Purse in Monrovia.

One of the members of their crew is an American freelance cameraman who has worked in Liberia for the past three years and has recently been covering the epidemic for US media outlets.

The rest of the crew, including Dr. Nancy, are being closely monitored and show no symptoms or warning signs. However, in an abundance of caution, we will fly them back on a private charter flight and then they will place themselves under quarantine in the United States for 21 days \u2013 which is at the most conservative end of the spectrum of medical guidance. \n  \n We know you share our concern for our colleagues and we will continue to keep you up to date and informed. |||||\n### Response:", "target": "\u2013 The voluntary isolation that Nancy Snyderman and her crew members agreed to is now mandatory\u2014and it might be because she apparently needed to make a food run last week.

{"source": "### Instruction:Give me a one line summary of the story below:Sbeineh, Syria (CNN) -- Sbeineh was once a thriving town on the southern outskirts of Damascus. Residents of the Syrian capital came to buy their furniture here and many factories, now abandoned, still line the main street into town. But the grinding, two-and-a-half-year war here has reduced Sbeineh to rubble. Its residents first fled when the town fell into the hands of rebels battling to bring an end to the reign of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But in early November the Syrian army reclaimed Sbeineh after a long and costly siege. The military pounded rebel positions with tanks, artillery and heavy machine guns for weeks in the lead-up to the siege. Assad's men then raided the town, taking it back house by house. Various opposition groups that had occupied Sbeineh blamed each other for losing the battle, saying some rebel fighters had put up very little resistance against government troops. We toured the destroyed town with a detachment from the Syrian army led by a soldier who goes by the name of Abu Aksam. \"Is this their freedom?\" Abu Aksam said, walking past a pock-marked building. \"Everything is broken.\" The soldiers walked us through a block of interconnected houses, where the rebels who occupied Sbeineh for nearly a year punched holes through the walls in order to move safely from apartment to apartment, rather than fall prey to a sniper's scope out in the streets. Government soldiers also uncovered a series of tunnels that the rebels were using to get supplies towards the front line. In one apartment we find a huge hole in the ground leading down to a tunnel used to smuggle weapons and ammunition to a sniper's vantage point at the other end. \"Our soldiers took heavy casualties from this position,\" Abu Aksam said. \"It was very difficult to get this done, but we did it, and we will keep going until the end because we believe in our country.\" Syrian troops showed us various locations in Sbeineh they claim served as headquarters for rebel groups ranging from the moderate Free Syrian Army to the Islamist Jabhat al-Nusra. Aksam also took us to a room that he says served as weapons-manufacturing workshop for opposition fighters. Aksam says rebels used these improvised mini-factories to make mortars, rockets and improvised bombs. \"They used the tools to make mortars and rockets and used gas cylinders to make very large bombs,\" he said, standing amid the debris inside the room. The government says Sbeineh was vital for resupplying its fighters in the southern outskirts of Damascus. Losing areas around the capital dealt a heavy blow to the Syrian regime's efforts to win the war, and the government has made it a priority to take the suburbs back. The Syrian army's victory at Sbeineh was a strategic triumph for the government as it tries to unseat rebels from the large swaths of territory they've taken east and south of the capital.

In 2010, Saudi Arabia\u2019s late King Abdullah decreed that only members of the Council and a few other clerics could issue a fatwa. \n  \n The WiFi fatwa follows a similar one issued last April by the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department (IACAD) of Dubai in the UAE. \n  \n \u201cIt is not allowed for people to use what belongs to others without payment or without their permission. Therefore, the internet should be used only after subscribing for the service,\u201d the government department wrote on its website. \n  \n Some Saudis reacted online to the WiFi fatwa by suggesting that it would be more appropriate for people to ensure their WiFi is secure by using a password.

Sometimes, they can be quite harmless, such as when a religious watchdog in the United Arab Emirates banned travelling to Mars. \n  \n In other instances, they reflect patriarchal, conservative norms or even outright misogyny: In Indonesia, clerics issued a fatwa against certain emoticons that could be seen as LGBT-friendly; the Islamic State, during the early stages of its insurgency in Syria, declared that women should not be allowed to sit in chairs. \n  \n Advertisement \n  \n The WiFi fatwa is far less provocative, although the need for it confused some commentators.

He clarified that public WiFi, such as that found in parks, hotels, and shopping malls, is A-OK to access.

Patek is one of the top suspects in the Bali bombings that killed more than 200 people in 2002, Indonesian police have said. Several news organizations reported Monday that Patek had been arrested in Pakistan on March 2. Indonesia has sent a team to Pakistan to confirm that it is indeed Patek that was arrested. Michael Tene, spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, said he was not sure why Australia issued the warning. \"As far as I know from our security forces, the police, the situation in Indonesia is quite normal. I can't speculate on what specific information the Australian government has that would make them issue this advisory,\" Tene said. Patek, an Indonesian of Javanese and Arab descent, is suspected of acting as the deputy field coordinator of the 2002 bombings in Bali. Seven Americans were killed in the attacks. Authorities and security experts say Patek was a member of the terror network Jemaah Islamiyah, that he took part in the Bali bombings, and that fled to Mindanao in the Philippines in 2003.

It will be a repeat of their epic last-four clash at the Australian Open in January, when Djokovic prevailed in five sets on his way to his fifth grand slam crown. Both he and Murray are playing their first tournament since their Melbourne exertions but both have shown little signs of ring rust. Three-time defending Dubai champion Djokovic saved a set point in the second-set tiebreaker before beating Tipsarevic 6-1 7-6, while Murray saw off the fifth seed Tomas Berdych 6-3 7-5. Victory for Djokovic was revenge for a defeat to his Davis Cup teammate at the ATP World Tour Finals in London last November and he acknowledged that he was fortunate the match had not gone to a deciding set. \"He was very close to take that second set,\" the top seed told the official ATP website. \"Then who knows what could have happened. We both got a little bit nervous towards the end, I guess, and it was just luck to prevail.\" Murray claimed his first win over Berdych in seven years and made the perfect start to break the Czech in the second game of the opener to take a one-set lead. The Scot twice broke in the second set, only for the big-hitting Berdych to retrieve them. But a further break in the 11th game proved decisive and he eventually claimed victory in one hour and 51 minutes. \"I had a great match with him in Australia, and hopefully can reverse the result tomorrow,\" Murray said of Friday's clash with Djokovic.

Program Overview . Home loans gone bad are wrecking the U.S. economy. CNN teams up with Fortune Magazine's Andy Serwer to investigate how the housing boom went bust. The fallout begins on Wall Street, where billions of dollars in American mortgages were bought, bundled and sold around the world. CNN takes the high-stakes mortgage game to Delmonico's, a Wall Street institution since 1837, where the likes of J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie once wheeled and dealed. Host Andy Serwer plays dealer and invites a few experts to face off on the mortgage crisis. Guest players include New York Times columnist and Princeton economist Paul Krugman, CNN's Personal Finance Editor Gerri Willis, securities guru Janet Tavakoli, investment strategist Peter Dunay and mortgage broker Jon Shibley. Grade Levels: 11-12, College . Subject Areas: Business, Economics, Finance, Social Studies, Life Skills . Objectives: . The CNN Special Investigations Unit Classroom Edition: Busted! Mortgage Meltdown and its corresponding discussion questions and activity challenge students to: . Curriculum Connections . Economics America National Standards . Standard 10 : Role of Economic Institutions . Students will understand that: Institutions evolve in market economies to help individuals and groups accomplish their goals. Banks, labor unions, corporations, legal systems, and not-for-profit organizations are examples of important institutions. A different kind of institution, clearly defined and enforced property rights, is essential to a market economy. Standard 16 : Role of Government . Students will understand that: There is an economic role for government in a market economy whenever the benefits of a government policy outweigh its costs. Governments often provide for national defense, address environmental concerns, define and protect property rights, and attempt to make markets more competitive. Most government policies also redistribute income. The Economics America National Standards (http://www.ncee.net/ea/standards/) are published by the National Council on Economic Education (http://www.ncee.net/). Social Studies . Standard V. Individuals, Groups and Institutions: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of interactions among individuals, groups, and institutions. Standard VI.

Point out to students that one of the best ways for them to prepare for homeownership is to arm themselves with knowledge, and that the purpose of this activity is to help them obtain this information. Group students and instruct each group to prepare a PowerPoint presentation on the top ten things that first-time homebuyers should know before they shop for a mortgage. Groups may want to include information that addresses these points: . Have groups deliver their presentations to the class. If possible, invite a realtor or mortgage broker to attend the presentations and discuss the guidelines that are used to determine whether or not a homebuyer can afford a home. Extension . Following the presentations, direct students to print and online resources to identify homes that are for sale in their community, as well as the current interest rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage, a 15-year fixed mortgage and a 5/1 ARM. Next, have each student select a house and use an online amortization schedule calculator to determine what the monthly payment (principle + interest) would be for each type of loan, assuming that the loan was for 80% of the purchase price of the home. Instruct students to identify the potential benefits and drawbacks of each type of loan, and to select the loan type that they feel would be the best choice for the homebuyer.

Four people were also taken to hospitals in serious condition after the Saturday crash at an off-road race in Southern California's Mojave Desert. Five others suffered minor to moderate injuries. \"The reason we are not going to file criminal charges is because it was a sanctioned event,\" said Mario Lopez, a California Highway Patrol spokesman. Lopez added that California vehicle codes did not apply to the race because permits were issued to the event's organizers. He said any safety violations would be investigated by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which owns the land where the race happened, or by agencies that handle permitted events. The 200-mile race was part of an amateur series on a course in the Lucerne Valley area of San Bernardino County, east of Los Angeles, said Tim Franke of the San Bernardino County Fire Department. The Bureau of Land Management has said it is looking into the deadly crash, as well as conducting a safety review of other off-road vehicle events in the state's deserts. The race's sanctioning body, Mojave Desert Racing, urges spectators to stay back 100 feet from the 50-mile course. \"But as you can tell, there are no delineations to where the track begins and where the track ends at this point,\" said Joaquin Zubieta, a California Highway Patrol spokesman. Images from the night of the crash show trucks speeding within feet of spectators. Mojave Desert Racing was not immediately available for comment. The land management bureau has said the group was responsible for the safety of everyone at the race. \"You can give all the warnings you want, but at the end of the day, they're out there, they're on their own and they do what they want,\" Larry Webster, automotive editor for Popular Mechanics magazine, said about off-road race crowds. \"It's almost like a vehicular version of running with the bulls, and obviously we can tell it's really dangerous,\" he told CNN. Authorities have identified Brett Sloppy as the driver of the out-of-control truck. In a Facebook message, Sloppy, who has not responded to repeated requests by CNN for comment, said he was devastated by what happened. \"Soo incredibly lost and devistated [sic] my thoughts and prayers go out to all the familys and friends involved,\" the San Marcos resident said on his Facebook page late Sunday. \"Thank you too all my friends for sticking with me even thru these tragic times I love you all.\" Vince Dimiao, a driver who was running just ahead of the truck that crashed, said races often take place at night because of the extreme daytime heat. He said officials initially halted the race for an hour because of the crash, then canceled it when the scope of the \"carnage\" became known. Keith Carty, who had a friend killed in the California crash, told CNN's HLN that races attract a certain type of person -- someone who wants to participate as much as watch an event. \"These are hard-core, off-road enthusiasts,\" he said about people who attend off-road races. \"It's not anybody's turn to baby-sit us. We're out there -- we understand the risk. Everybody that was there understood the risk -- the drivers, the spectators, everybody,\" said Carty. Jonathan Davy, who attended Saturday's deadly race and captured the accident on video, said he sensed the danger even before the crash. The event was his first off-road race. \"What seemed to be like a great day ... something I had never been to before, just turned tragic,\" he said. \"It's forever going to be in my head. I couldn't sleep last night. I got chills right now just thinking about it.\" CNN's Stan Wilson, Nick Valencia, Chuck Johnston and Rick Martin contributed to this report.\n### Response :", "target": "The Bureau of Land Management says it will review accident, other desert events .\nThe California Highway Patrol says it will not file criminal charges against the driver .\nThe driver says he is devastated by the incident .\nTruck crash at the off-road desert race leaves eight people dead .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?\n### Input: (CNN) -- What a week it's been for Formula One ace Nico Rosberg. A new wife, a World Cup win for his beloved German football team and now a new contract with the Mercedes team. Rosberg heads to his home grand prix in Germany this weekend on cloud nine -- and still leading the 2014 world championship by four points from Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton. First came the wedding, as the 29-year-old married childhood sweetheart Vivian Sibold in Monaco last week. The celebrations carried on as Rosberg enjoyed a rare race free Sunday by watching Germany defeat Argentina to lift the World Cup for a fourth time. The Mercedes driver -- who had sportingly invited French Lotus driver Romain Grosjean to watch Germany defeat France in the quarterfinals after qualifying for the British Grand Prix -- plans to mark Germany's triumph with a special helmet for his homecoming race. He will race around Hockenheim with football's World Cup trophy at the centerpiece of a black, yellow and red design. Rosberg, the son of 1982 F1 world champion Keke, also goes to Germany with a multi-year contract extension in his back pocket. The former Williams racer, who joined Mercedes when the Silver Arrows returned to the sport in 2010, has signed on for an unspecified number of seasons. \"I'm looking forward to the next years together,\" said Rosberg, who has raced to six victories with the German team. \"We will keep pushing to win even more races -- and hopefully championships.\" Mercedes motorsport chief Toto Wolff said: \"Nico's speed, commitment and focus have all helped to give clear direction and to drive the team forward since 2010. \"With his performances in 2014, Nico has demonstrated to the outside world what we already knew in the team; that he is one of the very top drivers in Formula One.\" Rosberg made his F1 debut with Williams in 2006 but his reputation has grown at Mercedes, particularly as he proved equal to the sport's seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher during their three years as teammates. Since replacing Schumacher in 2013, Lewis Hamilton has provided another benchmark for Rosberg to measure himself against. The English 2008 world champion is generally perceived to be the quicker driver but Rosberg has shown in 2014 that he is developing into a more rounded racer. Hamilton signed a three-year contract when he joined Mercedes with the deal due to expire at the end of 2015. From junior teammates and friends, Rosberg and Hamilton are now locked in an intriguing battle for the 2014 world title. Rosberg has won three races with Hamilton, who has lost valuable points with two retirements, taking five grand prix victories as the season reaches its halfway point. After Hamilton's victory at the British Grand Prix put him back in the title hunt, Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda predicted of his Mercedes charges: \"They will fight until the end like you do not believe to be world champion.\" Rosberg may already be enjoying an annus mirabilis but he still has his eye on the prize he really wants -- his first F1 world title.\n### Response: ", "target": "Nico Rosberg signs a new multi-year contract with the Mercedes F1 team .\nThe 29-year-old also married his long term girlfriend this week .\nRosberg will mark Germany's World Cup with a special helmet for Sunday's German Grand Prix .\nThe German driver leads Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton by four points .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Jazz musician Wynton Marsalis knows how important education is for youth, but what feeds their minds and souls, he says, often lies beyond traditional classroom walls. Musician Wynton Marsalis co-founded Jazz at Lincoln Center to broaden and inspire jazz audiences. \"The most essential thing for the development of kids and their understanding of the world are those things they do that's not school-related -- just any extracurricular activity,\" the Pulitzer Prize winner said. \"When you have activities you learn at a young age, you can do whatever you put your mind to!\" Marsalis, 47, co-founded Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York. As part of its goal to inspire and cultivate jazz audiences, Jazz at Lincoln Center sponsors youth events including an annual nationwide high school jazz band competition and festival, a Band Director's Academy and a popular concert series for kids. \"Jazz helps younger kids, especially, to connect with their innermost feelings and learn that [there's] nothing wrong with being real,\" Marsalis said. To Marsalis, jazz performer and instructor Davey Yarborough does just that. Yarborough provides Washington youth the opportunity and guidance to nurture their musical talents, not only as an educator at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts but also at his nonprofit jazz arts institute. Marsalis met Yarborough in the 1980s during one of his performance trips to the nation's capital and was struck by Yarborough's dedication to the students. \"I will see him at events, concerts. ... He always has kids with him,\" Marsalis said. \"He teaches all of his kids with the same intensity and feeling, and gives them that same feeling of specialness. It's something that can't be contrived.\"  Watch Marsalis describe how Yarborough inspires young people \u00bb . Yarborough, 55, says his motivation and inspiration stems, in part, from tragedy. After the 1988 death of one of his Duke Ellington students, Anthony Nash, in a drug trafficking incident, Yarborough decided to create a program geared toward music enrichment and mentorship during off-school hours. \"To have an element of the street take a student that was so bright and so promising was a trigger for me,\" Yarborough recalled. \"I knew all the students [as] family, and I want to know what's going on as much as I can with the students I am working with.\" Yarborough established a free summer-school music program at Duke Ellington to provide his students with a \"safe space\" where they could develop their skills. But when some school music programs in his district were cut, Yarborough noticed that many other students who had a desire to learn an instrument no longer had an opportunity to play or nurture their talent. \"The realization that I could only cater to the students at Ellington spurred the idea of 'OK, we need to take this into the community,' \" Yarborough said. After obtaining donated space in his local D.C. church, Yarborough and his wife, jazz vocalist Esther Williams, created the nonprofit Washington Jazz Arts Institute. Designed to serve those students who were \"left out\" by the school system or \"left behind\" by competitive Duke Ellington auditions, Yarborough says, the institute provides young local musicians with free jazz instruction, lectures, professional workshops and paid performance opportunities. They also have a mentoring system of professional artists. \"I wanted to really be able to see the students develop,\" Yarborough said. \"Once a young person decides they want to be a musician, such as I did in the third grade, they have a support system that takes them all the way through their career.\" Since its inception in 1998, more than 1,000 students have taken free music enrichment classes at the Washington Jazz Arts Institute. \"He loves those students,\" Marsalis said. \"There's no question that his kids have a much greater appreciation of jazz, but larger than [that], they have an appreciation of other people and of humanity and what we can all do if we invest in each other. They learn [that] from being in his presence.\"\n### Response : ", "target": "Wynton Marsalis co-founded Jazz at Lincoln Center to cultivate, inspire audiences .\nHis hero, Davey Yarborough's nonprofit jazz arts institute is a safe haven for youth .\nIt provides free lessons, lectures and paid performance opportunities .\nMarsalis: The nonprofit gives kids an appreciation of other people and humanity .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Read the paragraph below, then write a summary of it. \n### Input:(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama told CNN on Wednesday the recent uproar over his former pastor's sermons has reminded him of the odds he faces in winning the White House. Sen. Barack Obama opens up in a one-on-one exclusive interview with Anderson Cooper. \"In some ways, this controversy has actually shaken me up a little bit and gotten me back into remembering that the odds of me getting elected have always been lower than some of the other conventional candidates,\" the Illinois senator told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive one-on-one interview. Obama declined to speculate on whether the controversy surrounding the Rev. Jeremiah Wright's sermons may damage him politically, but said his campaign does best when it doesn't follow the \"textbook.\" \"If I was just running the textbook campaign -- doing the conventional thing -- I probably wasn't going to win because Sen. [Hillary] Clinton was going to be much more capable of doing that than I would be,\" he said. \"We had tremendous success, and I think we were starting to get a little comfortable and conventional right before Texas and Ohio.\" The exclusive interview came one day after Obama delivered a speech on race and politics in Philadelphia, during which he denounced some of Wright's comments, but said he could not repudiate the man himself. \"I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother. These people are a part of me. And they are a part of America, this country that I love,\" Obama said in the speech. Asked why he didn't denounce the controversial comment when he first heard of them more than a year ago, Obama noted Wright was on the verge of retirement. \"I told him that I profoundly disagreed with his positions. As I said before, he was on, at that stage, on the verge of retirement. ... You make decisions about these issues. And my belief was that given that he was about to retire, that for me to make a political statement respecting my church at that time wasn't necessary.\"  Watch him discuss his former pastor \u00bb . In the wide-ranging interview, Obama also hit back at rival Clinton's recent claims that he is standing in the way of revotes in Florida and Michigan. \"Sen. Clinton, I have to say on this, has been completely disingenuous. She said when she was still trying to compete with the votes in Iowa and New Hampshire that Michigan and Florida wouldn't count,\" he said. \"Then, as soon as she got into trouble politically and it looked like she would have no prospects of winning the nomination without having them count, suddenly she's extraordinarily concerned with the voters there.\" \"I understand the politics of it, but let's be clear that it's politics,\" he added. \"I want the Michigan delegation and the Florida delegation to be seated. And however the Democratic National Committee determines we can get that done, I'm happy to abide by those rules.\"  Watch what Obama has to say about DNC rules \u00bb . Those comments come hours after Clinton made a trip to Michigan and directly urged Obama to join her call to count the Michigan and Florida votes or hold new elections in those states. \"Sen. Obama speaks passionately on the trail about empowering American people. Today, I am urging him to match those words with actions to make sure people of Michigan and Florida have a voice and a vote in this election,\" Clinton said at a campaign rally in Detroit.  \"This is a crucial test [for Obama] -- does he mean what he says or not?\" Michigan and Florida held primaries in January, but the national party stripped them of their delegates for scheduling their contests too early. Michigan has 157 Democratic delegates at stake, and Florida has 211. On the issue of Iraq, Obama said significant improvements have been made, but the U.S. strategy \"continues to be a failed strategy.\"  Watch him explain his Iraq position \u00bb . \"I mean, no one has answered the question as to how this operation in Iraq -- that has now lasted five years, will have cost us more than a trillion dollars and thousands of lives -- how this has made us more safe.\" E-mail to a friend .\n### Response: ", "target": "Sen.

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.\n### Input:Los Angeles (CNN) -- Visitors to the Los Angeles Police Department website have identified five women depicted in photographs found in a suspected serial killer's home this summer, but police need to independently confirm those claims, spokeswoman Norma Eisenman said Friday. Authorities would not say whether those women are alive or dead, Eisenman said. A website displaying the photos received 10 million hits in 24 hours after police asked for assistance in naming more than 100 women depicted in 180 photos, which police released Thursday, Eisenman said. Some women were featured in more than one picture, police said. Police have also received more than a dozen phone calls since releasing the photos, they said Friday. Authorities want to know whether a serial killer known as the Grim Sleeper has more than the 10 murder victims that police are now alleging. \"We are grateful for the public's response to the release of the images,\" a statement said. \"It is our fervent hope that with this response, coupled with the tireless efforts of our detectives, the women depicted in these images will be positively identified.\" In July, 57-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr. was arrested and charged with 10 murders and one attempted murder dating to 1985, and Los Angeles police spent hundreds of hours sifting through thousands of photographs, Polaroids and videotape found in Franklin's house. The bodies of victims, many working as prostitutes, were all found in close proximity to each other in a neighborhood formerly known as South Central Los Angeles. Franklin, a mechanic who once worked for the LAPD, was arrested in July after police say they matched his DNA with DNA left on some of the victims. Police were led to Franklin after his 28-year-old son got arrested and gave a DNA swab, authorities said. Authorities said they narrowed the confiscated images down to 180 photographs. At a news conference Thursday attended by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Police Chief Charlie Beck, authorities said they had difficulty determining whether some of the women were alive or dead in the photos. \"We cannot tell,\" Beck said. \"Obviously, as all of you can see, some of them are animated, and some are not. It's impossible to tell by the photographs. Robbery Homicide Detective Dennis Kilcoyne said police have a responsibility to try to determine the whereabouts of the women. \"These are clearly photos of women that Mr. Franklin had contact with,\" Kilcoyne said. \"We have a responsibility to identify these women. They may be alive and well, but we need to be certain. \"If there's nothing we glean from this, we are able to fill in the timeline of Mr. Franklin's life, and that's one of our goals as well,\" Kilcoyne said. He declined to talk about the context in which the women's images appeared. \"The lifestyle or the situation that these women are in would defeat our plea with the public,\" Kilcoyne said. Police are not sure where the women in the images resided, because Franklin's movements throughout his life are not yet ascertained, authorities said. \"His travel habits are unknown to us,\" Kilcoyne said. \"We believe he spent the majority of his life right here in the city of Los Angeles.\"\n### Response :", "target": "NEW: The public has identified five of more than 100 women depicted in photographs .\nNEW: Authorities still need to confirm those claims .\nNEW: Website posting the photos gets 10 million hits in the first 24 hours .\nPhotos were found in the home of the Grim Sleeper suspect .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you outline the content?\n### Input:New Delhi (CNN) -- The story has all the stuff that sells: a sexy starlet, a powerful enemy spy agency and lots of bare flesh. Nude photographs of Pakistani actress Veena Malik, published in the December issue of the Indian edition of the men's magazine FHM prompted Malik to threaten a lawsuit. Malik said FHM doctored photographs to show her without clothes. The magazine, however, denied those allegations. Malik, editor Kabeer Sharma said, posed nude. What made the photos even more scandalous was that Malik's upper left arm bears the letters ISI, the acronym for Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency. In a legal notice served to the magazine, Malik contends that it was Sharma's idea for her to wear the painted on ISI tattoo; she was told t would be good for her image. And in another photo, which was originally slated for the cover, she is shown holding a grenade in her right hand. FHM published the grenade photo inside, with a line plastered across it: \"The cover we didn't use.\" Sharma said the magazine opted not to use the photo on the cover because it \"could have offended sensibilities.\" But the magazine has already incensed Malik. Lawyer Ayaz Bilawala told CNN that Malik is seeking $1.9 million in damages. Bilawala said the publication \"cheated\" his client and doctored the nude pictures. \"Proceedings (in a court of law) will begin soon,\" he said. FHM, Bilawala said, violated its agreement with the Pakistani model that stipulated that Malik would be shown the photos from the shoot before they were published. \"The pictures that are on display are tampered with, morphed and doctored,\" he said. Bilawala didn't dispute the ISI print on Malik's left upper arm but said numerous organizations worldwide used the same acronym. He refused comment on the grenade-like object. FHM India hinted at countersuing the actress. \"These allegations are completely and entirely false. We are exploring various other options, including filing a countersuit,\" Sharma told CNN. Malik said she never agreed to pose nude, the prospect of which sparked outrage in her homeland. \"What I am doing takes a lot of guts,\" she said. \"If I had posed nude for the magazine, I would be the first to admit it. But I didn't agree to this and they are wrong. \"I did not go for this, and I am deeply shocked and depressed about what has happened,\" she said. But Malik is no stranger to controversy. She triggered uproar two years ago when she claimed that her former boyfriend, Pakistani cricketer Mohammed Asif, was involved in spot-fixing international matches. Asif was found guilty last month in an English court. A year later, the actress came under fire from Pakistani clerics who decried her behavior in the Indian reality TV show \"Big Boss,\" as \"un-Islamic.\" \"I am not a perfect Muslim or a perfect person, but I haven't committed a crime, and unfortunately things like this are part and parcel of the industry I work in,\" Malik said. Still, she downplayed her criticism back home. \"I am not bothered about what they think,\" she said. \"My fans and many Pakistanis support me and believe (in) me.\" Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi and Shaan Khan reported from Islamabad, Pakistan.\n### Response: ", "target": "The magazine, FHM India, denies Veena Malik's allegation .\nAn attorney for Malik says nude photos in December issue were \"doctored\"\nOn cover, she holds what appears to be a grenade, has \"ISI\" written on her left arm .\nMalik's attorney says the actress is seeking $1.9 million in damages .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The first two stages of the 101st edition of the Tour will take place in the county of Yorkshire, with Leeds the host city of the Grand Depart. The third stage will move south with the finish in London, which successfully hosted the start of the 2007 Tour de France. British riders dominated this year's Tour as Bradley Wiggins recorded a memorable victory with his teammate Chris Froome in second place, while sprinting star Mark Cavendish claimed three stage wins. Wiggins went on to claim the gold medal in the men's time trial at the 2012 London Olympics, as millions crammed the roadside to watch his heroics. Christian Prudhomme, the director of the Tour de France, said this had been a major factor in their decision. \"Since the resounding success of the Grand Depart in London in 2007, we were very keen to return to the United Kingdom, . \"Bradley Wiggins' historic victory last July and the enormous crowds that followed the cycling events in the streets of London during the Olympic Games encouraged us to go back earlier than we had initially planned. \"Yorkshire is a region of outstanding beauty, with breathtaking landscapes whose terrains offer both sprinters and attackers the opportunity to express themselves,\" he added. Yorkshire is the biggest county in England and is the home of three notable former Tour de France riders in Brian Robinson, the first Britain to win a stage of the Tour de France in 1958, Barry Hoban, who won eight stages and Malcolm Elliott, the first British rider to hold the green points jersey in the three-week race. The region is likely to reap an economic benefit from hosting two stages, with an estimated two million people watching the equivalent legs of the 2007 race in the British capital and the southern county of Kent, bringing $141 million in extra revenue, according the the main backer of the start, Transport for London. Gary Verity, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, the agency behind the county's bid, said they were proud to have been selected. \"It will mean less than two years after hosting the Olympics the British public can look forward to another of the world's biggest sporting events coming to the country, \" he said.

Chicago, Dallas and Philadelphia all were hubs of harried travelers anxiously waiting for announcements that it was time to go. At some points, those didn't come for up to two hours. At Reagan National Airport in Washington, traveler Gregory Simpson had to wait an extra hour for his flight to Toronto. \"If you want to see family, you gotta do what you have to do,\" he said, taking the weather delay in stride. \"It's unfortunate that this tends to happen this time of year, but there's not a whole lot you can do about it.\" One man at LaGuardia International Airport in New York took advantage of the extra time. He hit the airport shops to do some last minute gift buying. \"Anywhere and everywhere I can,\" he told CNN affiliate WCBS with a wry smile. At least one holiday flight doesn't have to worry about such annoyances. Santa's aircraft, Candy Cane One, was cleared by the FAA for gift deliveries. There were more than 2,800 delays because of weather and other reasons for flights with U.S. points of departure and/or arrivals, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.com. More than 380 were canceled. White Christmas for some . There was good news for snowplow drivers in Chicago as a storm system that was forecast to bring snow ended up to the east of the city. It was also weaker than expected, the National Weather Service office in Chicago said. The folks that clear the roads Thursday in the Rockies won't be as lucky. A storm system that is moving eastward will drop snow on the mountains and the High Plains, the NWS says. Snow totals in some areas of Idaho, Montana, Utah, South Dakota and Wyoming could be significant. The sun should return to a broad section of the southern and central United States on Thursday. AAA projects that 98.6 million Americans will travel 50 or more miles this holiday season, a 4% increase from last year. Those traveling by car can take advantage of plummeting gas prices -- which, averaging $2.25 nationwide, are down 69 cents a gallon from a year ago. Storms kill four in Mississippi . People grieved Wednesday and cleared rubble in southern Mississippi, where a tornado system killed four people Tuesday night and packed an emergency room with dozens of injured. That storm tore to pieces a mobile home in the countryside of Jones County, Mississippi, killing two people, Sheriff Alex Hodge said. \"There were other brick and mortar homes that had major damage, but we have no other injuries reported,\" he said. The storm also wrecked a church. A few dozen miles to the southwest, two more people died in storms in Marion County, police said. The hospital overflowed with injured people. \"Fifty patients were seen in the ER today because of the storm,\" said Marion General Hospital spokeswoman Millie Swan. \"We are operating on generator power. Columbia is completely out of power.\" At least 6,300 households lost power and roads were cut off. Emergency operators have heard of people injured and trapped. Swan expects more injured patients to come into the hospital in coming days, once they can make it in. State of emergency . Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant issued a state of emergency for Marion and Jones counties. On a highway in between the two counties, the storm damaged a children's day care center, but spared the children inside. Unharmed, they were moved to a nearby bank building. In Louisiana, not far from the town of Amite, authorities said a windstorm damaged 15 homes.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?\n### Input :(CNN) -- A third person -- identified only as a girl -- has died from injuries sustained in last week's crash of Asiana Airlines Flight 214, officials at the San Francisco hospital where she was being treated said Friday. San Francisco General spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said the \"minor girl\" had been in critical condition at the Bay Area hospital since last Saturday's incident. The hospital didn't release any information about the girl -- including her name, age or ethnicity -- who died Friday morning, according to Dr. Margaret Knudson, the hospital's chief of surgery. \"It's a very, very sad day today at San Francisco General Hospital,\" said Dr. Geoffrey Manley, chief of neurosurgery. \"We have all done everything we could.\" Two other people -- both 16-year-old girls from China -- were reported dead soon after the Boeing 777 crash-landed at San Francisco International Airport. One of those teenagers was hit on the runway by a fire truck, though it's not clear whether she was already dead when she was struck, San Francisco police spokesman Albie Esparza told CNN on Friday. At the time, firefighters were using flame retardant that ended up surrounding areas immediately around the plane with foam, Esparza said. \"When the truck repositioned itself to get a better aim of the fuselage, they discovered the body of the victim in the fresh track from the path of the truck,\" he added. The foam was thick enough to cover a body, Esparza noted. Moreover, it is difficult for those in the \"industrial-size\" fire trucks that responded to crash to see things on the ground, the police spokesman said. \"Right now, we are waiting results from the coroner to determine if she died from the crash or the fire engine going over her,\" the police spokesman said. \"And that will be part of our investigations, like any other case, by our hit-and-run and major accidents investigations teams.\" Of the passengers and crew on board, 304 people survived -- 123 of whom walked away relatively unscathed and the remainder sent to hospitals. A handful of them remained hospitalized, including six patients at San Francisco General as of 3 p.m. (6 p.m. ET) Friday. That hospital's figure include two adults in critical condition with spinal cord injuries, abdominal injuries, internal bleeding, road rash and fractures. Besides the passengers and crew members' physical recovery, San Francisco International Airport is working to get back to normal as well. The airport was shut down to incoming and departing traffic for several hours after the Asiana crash, which occurred around 11:30 a.m. Saturday. Two of its four runways reopened later that day, though the charred remnants of the downed 777 remained -- a visible reminder of the horror that had unfolded. Early Friday morning, that airline's fuselage was hauled away on flatbed trucks to a remote section of the airport, said San Francisco International Airport in a press release. By 5:05 p.m., a Southwest Airlines jet landed on the runway where the crash occurred -- signifying that, for the first time in six days, all four of the airport's runways were operational. \"The tremendous efforts and around-the-clock work of airport staff, government agencies, airline tenants and contractors allowed us to complete all repairs and safety certifications for Runway 28L in a timely and efficient manner,\" said airport director John L. Martin. While the wreckage has been hauled away, investigators still have not pinpointed exactly why Flight 214 crashed, or who was to blame. An in-depth review of the cockpit voice recorder shows two pilots called for the landing to be aborted before the plane hit a seawall and crashed onto the runway, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday. The first internal call by one of the three pilots in the cockpit to abort the landing came three seconds before the crash and a second was made by another pilot 1.5 seconds before impact, NTSB chief Deborah Hersman said. The agency has begun wrapping up its investigation at the airport and crews are cleaning up the debris left by the crash. Investigators turned the runway back over to the airport. The runway has been closed since Saturday's crash. The investigation is shifting back to NTSB headquarters in Washington, where authorities will work to find a more definitive answer about what led to the crash. The passenger jet's main landing gear slammed into the seawall between the airport and San Francisco Bay, spinning the aircraft 360 degrees as it broke into pieces and eventually caught fire.

Deadly clashes erupted again at the border earlier this month. The disputed area is the site of Preah Vihear, a 900-year-old Hindu temple. In 1962, an international court awarded the temple to Cambodia, but Thailand claims that the area around the temple has not been clearly demarcated. The two countries have been in a stand-off since 2008, when UNESCO granted Preah Vihear World Heritage Status. Since the renewed fighting, ASEAN has sent Natalegawa to meet with leaders of both Thailand and Cambodia to try to ease tensions. The U.N. Security Council has also called for a permanent cease-fire and backed ASEAN's efforts to mediate. On Tuesday, Natalegawa said ASEAN is stepping up to the plate and is \"waging peace aggressively\". He expressed hope they can send off the observers to the border \"sooner rather than later.\" He could not say how many observers will be part of the team. He also added Thailand and Cambodia will continue to try resolving the conflict through bilateral talks, although Indonesia will be engaged in the process.

The sunken canal boats \u2014 one 65 feet long and the other 78 feet long \u2014 were found within a few miles of each other about midway between Oswego and Sackets Harbor, said Jim Kennard of Fairport. \n  \n Two professional divers using apparatus for deep-water work captured video images of the wrecks, located more than 200 feet below the surface, Kennard said. \n  \n The wrecks' identifications haven't been determined, but Kennard and fellow explorers Roger Pawlowski of Gates and Roland Stevens of Pultneyville believe the vessels were built in the mid-1800s when the Erie Canal was widened to accommodate larger boats. \n  \n Records of more than 600 Lake Ontario shipwrecks didn't turn up a match for either canal vessel, the explorers said. \n  \n Kennard said the two shallow-draft boats were probably being towed by steamboats when they sunk. Both showed damage indicating that their cargoes may have shifted during fast-changing weather conditions typical for Lake Ontario, he said. \n  \n Kennard said the vessels were likely older boats whose owners tried to get one more voyage out of them hauling cargo on the lake, which is connected to the Erie Canal by the Oswego Canal. \n  \n \"They took a chance,\" Kennard said. \"It didn't work.\" ||||| OSWEGO, N.Y. -- A team of shipwreck enthusiasts who have made several discoveries of sunken schooners, steamers and even an airplane in Lake Ontario have discovered two canal boats on the bottom of the lake. \n  \n \"They aren't suppose to be there,\" said Jim Kennard, a member of the team. \"What is a canal boat doing out there?\" \n  \n Kennard said the two canal boats, which may date back to the mid-1800s, could have been used on the Oswego Canal, but were not built to be used on Lake Ontario. \n  \n Kennard, Roger Pawlowski, and Roland Stevens, all from the Rochester area, have announced several of their discoveries over the past few years but they typically wait to make a discovery public until they know exactly what they've found. \n  \n \"We like to put a name to these boats first, but we haven't been able to identify them,\" Kennard said \n  \n The boats were discovered off of the shores of Oswego. Locating canal boats in Lake Ontario is an unusual event as these craft were not built for transportation on the open lake and therefore Kennard wanted to make sure that these were canal boats. Divers and an underwater remote operated vehicle were able to confirm that they were canal boats this summer. \n  \n Both canal boats were found within a few miles of each other on a route about midway between Oswego and Sackets Harbor. \n  \n It can be speculated that the owners of the canal boats decided to use their vessels to transport cargo to or from Oswego or Sackets Harbor, Kennard said. \n  \n \"They took a risk,\" he said. \n  \n Kennard said that no shallow canal boat could survive in the unpredictable conditions of Lake Ontario, which can change very quickly from calm to high wind and waves. \n  \n Historic shipwrecks abandoned and embedded in New York State underwater lands belong to the people of the state and are protected by state and federal law from unauthorized disturbance. \n  \n To learn more about the canal boats or read more about the team's other discoveries, visit the Shipwreck World website. \n  \n Sarah Moses covers the northern suburbs of Onondaga County and Oswego \n  \n County.

Irom Sharmila, 42, started her hunger strike in 2000 after 10 civilians were killed in a shooting blamed on the army in Manipur state. Sharmila -- also known as the \"Iron lady of Manipur\" -- has demanded the repeal of India's Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) because it gives sweeping powers to the military to search properties, detain suspects without warrants and shoot on sight. Since 2000, Sharmila has been arrested 14 times for trying to kill herself, prompting authorities to force feed her under a law that makes attempted suicide illegal, her counsel Khaidem Mani told CNN. But Mani challenged the attempted suicide charge, citing the country's history of hunger strikes. Mahatma Gandhi used the same mode of protest during the nation's independence struggle, he told the sessions court in Imphal East, a district of Manipur. \"I also argued that a hunger strike was no crime,\" he said. The magistrate ruled there was insufficient evidence to prove she was attempting to commit suicide. In doing so, he overturned a lower court's attempt to put her on trial for attempted suicide. After the court ordered her release, Sharmila resumed her hunger strike, her lawyer added. Last year, India's Vice President Hamid Ansari admitted there had been \"serious complaints of misuse of the AFSPA.\" \"This reflects poorly on the state and its agents,\" a statement from his office said. Meantime, Amnesty International called Sharmila's arrests \"farcical,\" saying she should not be taken into custody again. \"The judgment must end the farcical cycle of arrest and re-arrest that this brave activist has faced for so long. Authorities must not detain Irom Sharmila again but engage with the issues she is raising,\" said Shemeer Babu, the rights group's program director in India. Activists and non-profit organizations have repeatedly urged the Indian government to scrap the AFSPA. In 2005, a government-appointed committee recommended the law be abolished. Its recommendations remain under the government's \"consideration,\" India's Deputy Home Minister Kiren Rijiju told the national parliament last month. Manipur is an impoverished, landlocked state in India's remote northeastern belt. For years, many Manipuri tribal communities have resisted the authority of Delhi, claiming that they have suffered neglect from the central government.

That's right, the day before the event the Olympic field of play needs work. \"It's the Olympics. It should be flawless,\" Davis, of the United States, told Yahoo. Bleacher Report sums up the media coverage of the storm a brewin' at the halfpipe. On Sunday night, White was asked by reporters what he thought of the course. He tried to be nice, but they could tell he was not pleased. Still he tried to give it the best spin. \"I'm sure it will be (OK). I have faith,\" he said. One thing is certain.

It seems weird but until this year, women haven't been able to slide down a really slick ramp, then hurtle themselves through the air. That used to be a men's only club (since 1924). It wasn't because women are smarter than men; it was because they were excluded for who knows what reason. Lindsey Van took part in the 2002 Salt Lake City Games. She was one of the jumpers who tested the hills for the men's events. Female ski jumpers took the International Olympic Committee to court before the Vancouver Games but came up with an empty victory. They still watched from the sidelines. But just a year later the IOC announced women's ski jumping was in, so don't blame Van and the others if they are just a little bit excited Tuesday. They've come a long way.

But that's where Elizabeth Warren stood on Wednesday night in Charlotte where she delivered a strident speech that brought a packed convention arena to its feet in thunderous appreciation. \"Americans are fighters. We are tough, resourceful and creative. If we have the chance to fight on a level playing field \u2014 where everyone pays a fair share and everyone has a real shot \u2014 then no one can stop us,\" Warren said. A Harvard law professor, Warren is challenging Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, for the seat he won in a 2010 special election to replace the late Democrat Ted Kennedy. It has been a tight race for the better part of a year, and Warren aimed key parts of her nationally televised address to Bay State voters. Warren was best known before her campaign as a watchdog of the government's corporate bailout program, a top financial adviser to President Barack Obama, and the force behind a high-profile agency borne from the 2010 Wall Street reform legislation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. CNN Fact Check: The $2,000 question ... She focused most of her convention appearance on the middle class, a major theme for Democrats at their convention and on the campaign trail. \"For many years now, our middle class has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered,\" she said. \"People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: They're right. The system is rigged.\" While she didn't mention Brown in her speech, Warren went after the more conservative Mitt Romney, Obama's Republican opponent in November who she characterized as an uncompromising ally of Wall Street who would raise taxes on the middle class. \"Mitt Romney wants to give billions in breaks to big corporations \u2014 but he and Paul Ryan would pulverize financial reform, voucher-ize Medicare, and vaporize Obamacare,\" she said of the former Massachusetts governor and his running mate. Warren repeated a line she frequently uses on the campaign trail, taking aim at Romney's infamous statement that \"corporations are people.\" \"No, Governor Romney,\" she said. \"Corporations are not people. People have hearts, they have kids, they get jobs, they get sick, they cry, they dance. They live, they love, and they die. And that matters.\" Well under way for about a year, Warren's race is one of the most expensive Senate campaigns in the country. Since entering the contest, Warren has raised a massive $28 million, with Brown also taking in more than $19 million. The question now is whether her speech will give her a boost to put her ahead of Brown. When Warren entered the contest a year ago, she quickly rose to the ranks of widely known and beloved Democrats, having already been a target of congressional Republicans for taking on Wall Street, a key GOP constituency. Political observers have described the race as crucial for determining control of the Senate. Democrats hold a four-seat margin in the 100-seat chamber. Additionally, two Independents reliably caucus with Democrats. The Senate campaign has largely grown into a competition over which candidate is the toughest advocate for everyday people. Republicans, however, try to frame her as a liberal ideologue with little to no centrist appeal. Warren got big spotlight at the convention, while Brown has not tied himself so closely to his party. Brown didn't make a high-profile speech at last week's GOP convention and he is less than shy about asserting his independent spirit as a Republican in typically Democratic Massachusetts. He launched a website this week critical of Warren on taxes and other issues. Progressive group hits milestone in support of Warren . Obama sings high praises for Warren .

This picture provided to CNN is said to show refugees being towed out to sea by the Thai army. But a CNN investigation has uncovered evidence that for hundreds of Rohingya refugees -- members of a Muslim minority group -- abuse and abandonment at sea were what awaited them in Thailand, at the hands of Thai authorities. Extraordinary photos obtained by CNN from someone directly involved in the Thai operation show refugees on their rickety boats being towed out to sea, cut loose and abandoned. One photo shows the Thai army towing a boatload of some 190 refugees far out to sea.  Watch the backstory on the investigation \u00bb . For days, accusations have been carried in several regional papers that the Thai army has been systematically towing boat-loads of Rohingya refugees far out to sea and setting them adrift. The army denied it, and the Thai government has launched an inquiry. CNN's investigation -- based on accounts from tourists, sources in Thailand and a Rohingya refugee who said he was on a boat towed back out to sea -- helps to piece together a picture of survival thwarted by an organized effort not just to repel arriving refugees, but to hold them prisoner on shore, drag them in flimsy boats far out to sea and then abandon them.  Watch CNN's investigation into reports of refugees being set adrift \u00bb . Three tourists recently voiced concern to CNN over what they had seen -- and in some cases photographed -- near Thailand's tourist areas. One tourist provided CNN with photos last week of refugees detained by Thai authorities on a beach near a tourist site, with the refugees prone on the sun-bleached sand while guards stood nearby. \"Whenever someone raised their head or moved, they [guards] would strike them with a whip,\" said Australian tourist Andrew Catton. A CNN crew traveled to a remote stretch of the Thai coast four hours north of the tourist island of Phuket to investigate the growing reports that the Thai military was secretly detaining Rohingya refugees before towing them out to sea and setting them adrift. In an isolated beach area, debris including sandals and campfire remnants indicated that large numbers of people had been there but were nowhere to be seen. The crew then traveled to a nearby island, where residents reported that refugees who had escaped were living in the jungle. In one hamlet, villagers had captured a Rohingya man they believed had been living in the jungle for days. The refugee, who identified himself as Iqbal Hussain, told CNN he was on one of six boats in a makeshift refugee fleet that arrived in Thailand in December. He said all six boats with their refugee cargo were towed back out to sea in January, and five of the six boats sank. His boat made it back to shore, and he hid in the jungle for days until nearby villagers captured him.

A source in the Thai military, after extensive questioning, did confirm to CNN that the Thai army was operating a dump-at-sea policy. But the source defended it, insisting that each boatload of refugees was always given sufficient supplies of food and water. That source claimed local villagers had become afraid of the hundreds of Rohingya arriving each month, and that they were accusing the refugees of stealing their property and threatening them.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?\n### Input:(Health.com) -- After playing just one match, Venus Williams announced Wednesday that she is withdrawing from the U.S. Open. The 31-year-old has had nearly every injury in the book, but she offered an unusual reason this time around: Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, a poorly understood autoimmune disorder that causes joint pain and can deplete energy levels. Williams had played only 11 matches this season because of injuries and illness. \"I am thankful I finally have a diagnosis and am now focused on getting better and returning to the court soon,\" Williams said in a statement. As many as 4 million Americans have Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pronounced SHOW-grens), according to the Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome Foundation, making it the second most common autoimmune disease after rheumatoid arthritis, and ahead of lupus. Ninety percent of the people with the syndrome are women. Health.com: Signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis . It's \"a major women's health problem,\" says Frederick B. Vivino, M.D., associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and chief of rheumatology at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, in Philadelphia. \"A lot of patients look a lot better than they feel.\" How well are you managing your RA? Take a test . In Sj\u00f6gren's, the white blood cells attack moisture-producing glands. The most common symptoms are persistent dry eyes and dry mouth, but the syndrome can lead to complications including extreme fatigue, joint pain, and problems with the kidneys, lungs, liver, pancreas, and central nervous system. Health.com: 12 nice things you can do for someone in pain . Because the symptoms are similar to those of many other conditions, Sjogren's is difficult for even the most experienced doctors to diagnose. It often takes years for a patient to receive a diagnosis after first experiencing symptoms. Elite athletes like Williams are no more or less likely to come down with the syndrome, but they may be more likely to receive an earlier diagnosis. \"An elite athlete might notice symptoms sooner,\" Vivino says. \"When you're running around huffing and puffing, your mouth is more likely to dry out sooner. Another important symptom -- fatigue -- will slow them down and affect their performance. And if they develop joint and muscle pain [that] persists, that leads to further testing to try to figure out what's wrong.\" Health.com: Pain relief for athletes -- what works best? There is no known cure for Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, but symptoms can be managed with both over-the-counter products like artificial tears and sugar-free lozenges and prescription immunosuppressive drugs. The condition disappears suddenly in about 5% of cases, but the majority of people have lifelong problems. That doesn't necessarily mean Williams is done with tennis for good. \"Most manifestations are treatable and in most cases we can restore people to healthy and productive lives,\" Vivino says. \"Whether we can return an elite athlete to competition, that's another story, but we do feel the treatment makes a big difference.\" Copyright Health Magazine 2011 .\n### Response: ", "target": "Venus Williams played only 11 matches this season due to injuries and illness .\nAs many as 4 million Americans have Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome .\nNinety percent of the people with the syndrome are women .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

They are launched into space as capsules atop a rocket, and are capable of landing on land, not requiring a body of water to splash down in. A Soyuz carried the first ever crew to the ISS in November 2000, according to NASA. One is docked there at all times, in case the crew needs to leave in an emergency. It became the standard mode of transportation to the station after the deadly 2003 Columbia space shuttle accident. The modern version, the Soyuz TMA, is made of three parts. Two of them jettison then burn upon reentry into Earth's atmosphere, according to NASA. Only the Descent Module will land on Earth, carrying Commander Kevin Ford of NASA, Russian Soyuz Commander Oleg Novitskiy and Russian Flight Engineer Evgeny Tarelkin. NASA TV will broadcast the undocking and landing live. The undocking of the Soyuz will mark the beginning of the 35th ISS mission, which awaits the arrival of two more Russian cosmonauts and an American astronaut in two weeks.

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the central ideas presented?\n### Input:London (CNN) -- A storm of outrage provoked by photos of Pippa Middleton showing her in a car with a man wielding what appears to be a gun in France should act as a wake-up call, royal watchers have warned Prince William's sister-in-law. \"This story is very damaging for her,\" veteran London-based public relations expert Max Clifford told CNN. \"There has been nothing but a honeymoon for Pippa since last year's royal wedding so this is dreadful,\" Clifford said. \"It comes particularly at a time when guns in Paris are such a sensitive issue. The reality is she could have been shot by police.\" Middleton has been a target for tabloid newspapers and paparazzi since her sister married Prince William last April. Shortly after the wedding, personal pictures of the 28-year-old began to leak out to the press, including a photo showing her in a bikini while on vacation in 2006 with her sister and Prince William. A photo of Middleton sunbathing topless on that trip was also made public. Later, undated photos from a private party showing her dancing in her bra were also leaked. The latest incident happened as paparazzi were taking pictures of Middleton who was being driven to a Paris train station in an Audi convertible. The car's driver wielded a gun, apparently pointing it in the air and then at a photographer, who was following them and captured the shot, according to The Sun. It is unclear if the gun was real or fake. Lawyers told CNN that Middleton was unlikely to face charges unless it could be proved she encouraged the driver to point the gun on public streets, but the driver could face charges of threatening with a firearm if French authorities wanted to do so. Middleton is the sister of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, who married Prince William last year. William is second in line to the British throne behind his father, Prince Charles. Buckingham Palace said it would not comment on the photo because Middleton is not a member of the royal family. The photo is causing a stir, after a spate of gun violence in France recently, including a series of attacks last month that killed seven people, including three children. The incident took place while security was heightened ahead of France's presidential election. \"Pippa must understand she's in the middle of a media spotlight and she can't just turn the attention on and off,\" Clifford added. \"I assume she has PR advice but either she's getting incredibly bad advice or she's not listening.\" The story has been splashed across newspapers around the world, and on Tuesday royal experts warned that Middleton must avoid further incidents for risk of damaging the royal family. \"Pippa is surprised at how high-profile she now is,\" one royal newspaper correspondent, who has met Middleton on several occasions, told CNN. \"Part of her enjoys the attention: she's always mixed with high-society characters and she loves partying but she's not off the rails by any means. \"This prank in a Paris street will come as a real wake-up call for Pippa,\" the correspondent, who declined to be named, told CNN. \"She must now realize that it just takes one person waving a gun around to seriously dent her public image. She'll be gutted by how badly this has reflected on the royals.\" But the correspondent said he believed Paris authorities would have no choice but to investigate the incident, while Middleton would be forced to issue a public apology. The photographer who snapped the shot was \"considering his options\" about a formal police complaint, The Sun reported. The Daily Express's royal correspondent Richard Palmer commented that ever since Middleton became last year's most celebrated bridesmaid at the wedding of her sister Kate to Prince William, she has been \"riding the crest of a wave of popularity. Some think she has also been riding for a fall.\" Palmer said Middleton was popular at high-society events, but she and her friends needed \"to learn how to behave in front of the cameras in return.\" The incident \"will have embarrassed her sister Kate, her brother-in-law Prince William, and also the Queen in her Diamond Jubilee year.\" \"She needs to explain herself and apologize.\"\n### Response : ", "target": "Storm of outrage over photos of Pippa Middleton in car with man apparently wielding gun .\nRoyal watchers say incident should act as a wake-up call to Prince William's sister-in-law .\nPhoto is causing a stir, after a spate of gun violence in France recently .\nRoyal experts say Middleton must avoid further incidents for risk of damaging royal family .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Michigan Rep. Thad McCotter, who is running for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, switched from voting no to yes during the 90-minute session. Reps. Blake Farenthold of Texas, Billy Long of Missouri and Jeff Denham of California are now backing the speaker\u2019s plan, as are Reps. Darrell Issa of California, Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, Nan Hayworth of New York and Dan Lungren of California.

Other hard \u201cno\u201d voters have flipped to leaning no or even undecided. \n  \n But despite having momentum on their side, Boehner and his top lieutenants don\u2019t have a big margin for error. Few, if any, Democrats are expected to vote for the debt ceiling package, so Republicans must cobble together 217 votes on their own. They can lose just 23 lawmakers and still pass it.

If that happens, they may throw their support to the Boehner plan, said one of the lawmakers. \n  \n Pence\u2019s position is in contrast to earlier positions of the conservative Republican Study Committee, which he once chaired. The RSC has pushed a balanced-budget amendment that requires a supermajority to raise taxes. Pence\u2019s argument is that GOP leaders should launch a \u201cserious effort\u201d to pass a balanced-budget amendment as part of this debt deal by putting forth a bill that could garner Democratic votes. \n  \n \u201cI cannot vote to raise the debt ceiling if we don\u2019t do everything in our power to send a balanced-budget amendment to the Senate and the states,\u201d Pence said in an interview. \n  \n Wednesday also began some serious internal GOP drama involving the RSC and other Republican lawmakers. The RSC is now chaired by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan. \n  \n Wesley Goodman, an RSC aide, sent an email to a network of conservative activists opposed to the Boehner proposal \u2014 they don\u2019t think it cuts spending enough \u2014 on Tuesday saying now \u201cis the day to kill the Boehner deal.\u201d Goodman said that the RSC needs \u201cstatements coming up to the Hill every hour of the day in mounting opposition to the plan.\u201d |||||\n### Response :", "target": "\u2013 The CBO report that forced John Boehner to delay the vote on his debt ceiling plan may end up working in his favor, reports the Hill.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has given a girl's parents the go-ahead to sue a Massachusetts school district over alleged sexual harassment by another student. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling allows a couple two avenues to pursue claims against their daughter's school district. The justices, in a unanimous ruling, allowed the plaintiffs two avenues to make their claims -- a 1972 law banning gender bias in education and a separate civil rights law enacted 138 years ago. Lisa and Robert Fitzgerald said their then-kindergartner daughter was forced by an older male student to lift her skirt or pull down her underwear. The parents alleged school officials ignored their concerns and refused to discipline the boy. Federal courts had been split over whether the newer law -- known as Title IX -- displaced any claims made under part of the 1871 civil rights law, called \"Section 1983.\" The Fitzgeralds lost their initial Title IX claims and an appeals court blocked them from pursuing the other legal strategy. The ruling from the justices now gives the Fitzgeralds the right to continue their lawsuit against school officials. \"We hold that Section 1983 suits based on the Equal Protection Clause remain available to plaintiffs alleging unconstitutional gender discrimination in schools,\" Justice Samuel Alito wrote. The plaintiffs allege the incidents happened on a school bus in Barnstable, Massachusetts, in the 2000-01 academic year. The child had told her parents that whenever she wore a dress, a third-grader would make her do things she did not want to do. After the mother complained to school officials, the boy denied the allegations. The principal, after interviewing other students and the bus driver, concluded she could not corroborate the girl's version of events. The principal suggested the girl be transferred to another bus as a possible solution. The Fitzgeralds said that amounted to punishing their daughter and said the boy was the one who should be transferred. The local police department also looked into the case but concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the boy. The parents began driving the girl to school and filed a lawsuit, claiming the schools system's response was inadequate. School officials denied wrongdoing and tried to limit the case to Title IX, which applies to public or private schools receiving federal aid. The law is credited, among other things, with helping bring equality in sports participation and funding for college women. \"Our concern was that the school district just didn't take things as seriously as they should,\" said Charles Rothfeld, attorney for the Fitzgeralds. \"They were frustrated by what they perceived as indifference by the school.\" Rothfeld said the school's behavior was \"pretty egregious.\" Barnstable school officials did not respond to a request for comment. The case is Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Cmte. (07-1125).\n### Response : ", "target": "Parents allege older boy sexually harassed daughter on school bus .\nParents: School district ignored our concerns, refused to discipline the boy .\nU.S. Supreme Court: Parents can sue school district .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

A government offensive launched this summer has caused more bloodshed. The conflict is considered to be both separatist -- over who will assert authority in the area -- and sectarian -- whether Shiite Islam will dominate in majority Sunni Yemen. The rebels are supporters of slain Shiite cleric Hussein al-Houthi. As the fighting escalates, the situation is worsening for children, Kaag said. \"During the past three months, children affected by the conflict in the north have seen all their basic rights violated.

Balochistan province -- Pakistan's largest and one of its most troubled -- is home to a nationalist insurgency and an increasingly violent Taliban presence. The sight of Baloch troops marching in the Pakistani army might have been unimaginable three years ago, but recruits are now training to fight for the army, not against it. More than 3,500 such troops have been recruited since 2007, commanders say. \"The whole exercise is to integrate the Balochi youth,\" said Gen. Athar Abbas, a Pakistani army spokesman. \"If you encourage people all over the province to join the army and the state system ... that is going to diffuse whatever insurgency is left in these parts.\" Part of that encouragement includes education. At an army engineering school, free courses are given to hundreds of civilian students. The coursework includes time in a computer, filling an education gap the government can't. \"We are established since the inception of Pakistan and we have more expertise and variety here,\" said Brig. Jamil Sarwar Malik. The army also has made inroads by opening schools. When earthquakes hit the province two years ago, the army rushed in to help, but then stayed and boosted their popularity with a rebuilding program in the absence of government reconstruction. The army said its soldiers gave up a day's pay, more than a million dollars, to build a school. The sum of their efforts have built 25 schools, 12 mosques and four health clinics. After nearly a quarter century, the army has reopened mines that were closed, while warring tribes fought because the central government was keeping the profits. The alienation led to calls for independence -- the Balochistan nationalist movement. With the mines open, $75 million dollars worth of coal has been extracted so far, with $16 billion dollars worth still underground. \"It is being spent overwhelmingly -- over 80 to 90 percent -- on the area itself,\" for residents, for the children and for future generations, said Abbas. But siding with the military can come at a cost. Tribal leader Rab Nawaz Zing said he's been attacked 18 times for supporting the army. He blames other tribal chiefs. \"If you want schools, you get shot,\" he said. \"They say we don't need health centers and roads.\" While the counterinsurgency is making progress, the military acknowledges that it will take many more years of its best efforts to turn the tide and make the Taliban and nationalist ambitions a thing of the past.\n### Response: ", "target": "Balochistan province is home to nationalist sentiments and Taliban violence .\nThe army is recruiting Baloch residents to join its fighting force .\nImproved living conditions are part of the military's plan to win support .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Cities put emergency crews to work throughout much of the region while state offices and schools were shut down. An estimated 8 inches fell in De Kalb in eastern Mississippi, while 200 miles south in metro Biloxi, snow fell but didn't stick, the National Weather Service reported. \"We had flurries for about five minutes where I am, that's it,\" said John DeMiller, owner of the Petit Bois Grocery in Biloxi. DeMiller's 10th-grade daughter stayed home from school Friday after the Mississippi Department of Education closed all schools due to inclement weather. DeMiller hadn't expected much snow, and when schools were closed in his town without accumulations, he was flabbergasted. \"I'm going, 'they just lost their mind,' \" he said. Share your winter weather photos, stories . Just north of metro Biloxi, though, 1-2 inches fell and black ice could pose a problem as wind chills drop, National Weather Service forecaster Phil Grigsby said. Officials in Georgia were bracing for enough snow to paralyze parts of the state. Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, which canceled hundreds of flights, had reported 4 inches of snow, National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Darbe said. Numerous accidents have been attributed to the dangerous conditions, he said. Temperatures were to fall to the mid- to upper-20s in the Atlanta area after the snow tapered off sometime between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. Friday, he said. Traffic accidents were expected to increase as slush turned to ice late Friday, he said. The clear skies already over parts of western Alabama are expected to move into Georgia later this weekend, Darbe said. In Louisiana, Commissioner of Administration Angele Davis announced state government offices were closed in 42 parishes. Earlier in the day, iReporter Susan Sharman in Bastrop, Louisiana, said she couldn't believe snow was falling over her town. \"I haven't seen snow like this in Bastrop in over eight years,\" she said. Metro Baton Rouge, Louisiana, saw about an inch of snow on its streets, while the rest of the area got 1 to 3 inches, Grigsby said. But Mardi Gras revelers don't have much to worry about. The very early morning snow shouldn't interfere with parades Friday evening, he said. Windchills in the 30s, however, mean paradegoers need to bundle up before the fun. Drivers should also be wary of any black ice that may form on bridges and overpasses, he said. Yasamie Richardson of Alabama Emergency Management said conditions could be \"very, very dangerous,\" in her state and the likelihood of power outages was \"very great.\" She said authorities were encouraging people to prepare for the possibility of losing electricity. \"My husband and I haven't seen snow since we were stationed in Massachusetts and my children have never seen it,\" Sara Johnson in Wilmer, Alabama, said in a CNN iReport as the first flakes began to fall Friday morning. The weather system pounded parts of Texas on Thursday, leaving a record 12.5 inches in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The National Weather Service said the 24-hour total in the area topped the previous record of 12.1 inches set in 1964. \"For the DFW Metroplex this is amazing,\" said iReporter Brent Dow. See Dow's photo of a Texas-size snowman . West of Dallas, in Irving, Texas, Michael Whiteside was awakened at 2:45 a.m. Friday \"to the sound of my patio roof collapsing from the weight\" of the snow, he said in a CNN iReport. At Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, where American and American Eagle canceled about 230 flights, officials were working to ramp up departures Friday. An Airport spokesman said Friday afternoon that most flights were running on time. There was some relief in sight for the South. Warmer weather was melting the snow Friday in Dallas, and temperatures in the 40s were expected to move through the rest of the region over the weekend. The Southern states were getting a smaller dose of what their Northeastern and mid-Atlantic counterparts have experienced this week. That area is digging out from a pair of record-setting blizzards. The first storm dumped more than 30 inches of snow in some places last weekend, while the latest part of the one-two punch dropped 22.5 inches on Baltimore, Maryland; 15.8 inches on Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and about 10 inches on Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia; Central Park in New York; and Atlantic City, New Jersey, the National Weather Service said. Records for total snowfall for the season have been set at Dulles International Airport west of Washington, with 72 inches; Philadelphia, with 70.3; Baltimore, with 70.1; Reagan Washington National Airport, with 55.6; and Atlantic City, with 48.7, according to the weather service.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?LONDON, England (CNN) -- He is hailed as a god in his native Argentina, has been a vital part of the country's culture since the mid-70s and is largely considered to be one of the greatest footballers of all time. Maradona's crowning achievement was captaining Argentina to World Cup glory in 1986. Now, 11 years since retiring from playing, Diego Maradona is making a triumphant return to the sport as the Argentine national coach. However, his checkered past has made Maradona something of a surprise choice. The 48-year-old has regularly courted controversy -- not with-standing his well-publicized drug-addiction. His talent has never been in doubt, though, and his performances on a domestic and world stage are the stuff of legend. Since beginning his career as a 15-year-old with Argentinos Juniors, Maradona has attracted legions of fans. At club level, Maradona won the Argentine title with Boca Juniors, prompting a high-profile move to European football, where he won the Copa del Rey with Barcelona. But it was at Napoli that his presence was really felt. When he arrived, the club were not considered title contenders in Serie A, but with Maradona's arrival, the southern side were transformed into one of Italian football's dominant forces. During his time with Napoli, the club won the Scudetto twice, the Coppa Italia and the UEFA Cup. And his status as a national hero was further cemented during his performances in the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups. Though he briefly shone in his World Cup debut in 1982, before an act of petulance saw him sent off against Brazil, it was the 1986 tournament in Mexico that Maradona made his own. Maradona took the finals by the scruff of the neck, scoring five times, including one of the greatest goals ever scored in the 2-1 quarterfinal win over England -- as well as creating more controversy with his infamous \"hand of God\" goal in the same match. But his iconic status as a footballer is only outshone by his wild private life. His time at Napoli came to an abrupt end after he was found in possession of cocaine, and his last World Cup as a player, USA 1994, was beset with controversy, as he was sent home early after failing a drugs test. And the Maradona soap opera has continued after his retirement. Since quitting in 1997, he has spent a great deal of time in drug rehabilitation clinics in Cuba and Switzerland, where he combated his addiction to cocaine. He has also been subject to dramatic weight gain, struggling with obesity and eventually undergoing gastric bypass surgery to prevent any further fluctuations in his size. In recent years he has also been treated for the affects of alcohol abuse and his health has been a cause for much concern among the world's sports media. He has been hit by hepatitis at least twice and in 2004 he was rushed to hospital after a heart attack, following a cocaine overdose. And at times he has even seemed mentally unstable -- in a famous incident the one time chat show fired a gun at media waiting outside his house, hitting and injuring four. But, despite the negative stories that have circulated about Maradona, he is still regarded as a national hero in Argentina. No-one can doubt his skills as a player, but it has certainly raised a few eyebrows that he has been put in charge of an Argentina team that is struggling to hold its own in the World Cup qualifiers. Whether he can strategize like a professional manager is yet to be seen, but simply by being Maradona, he will prove to be a great figurehead for the team.\n### Response : ", "target": "Diego Maradona is a football legend in Argentina, one of the world's greats .\nHis skills at Napoli and for the Argentina national side are highly praised .\nHe has a reputation for leading a wild private life, was addicted to cocaine .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.\n### Input :When U.S. forces toppled the Taliban government following the 9/11 attacks, there was a global wave of support from people horrified by the plight of Afghan women. Under the Taliban, women had been denied education, banned from medical treatment by male doctors, and publicly executed for \"immorality.\" The Taliban's fall promised women some basic freedoms and rights. Indeed, over the past 10 years there have been significant improvements for Afghan women and girls. Official restrictions ended on access to education, work, and health care. Millions of girls went to school for the first time. Women joined government, won elected office, and became police officers and even soldiers. A new constitution in 2004 guaranteed women equal rights, and a 2009 law made violence against women a crime. Underneath the surface of these changes, however, deep seated problems persist. Women in public life have suffered harassment, threats, and sometimes murder. Forced marriage, underage marriage, and domestic violence are widespread and too widely accepted. About 400 women and girls are imprisoned at present for the \"moral crimes\" of sex outside of marriage and simply running away from home, often to flee abuse. While education is more accessible, more than half of girls still don't go to school. Every two hours an Afghan woman dies of pregnancy-related causes. As the announced departure of international forces in 2014 draws closer, many Afghan women look to the future with fear.  They worry that the troop pullout signals the end of interest in Afghanistan, and with it the international commitment to push the Afghan government to promote and protect women's rights. Also likely to decrease is the foreign aid that pays for schools and clinics that have changed many lives. Afghan women fear being abandoned again by the rest of the world, as they were during the Taliban era. Plans for peace negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government raise the specter of women's rights being bargained away. If there are no women at the negotiating table, this is even more likely. This week the fragility of women's rights in Afghanistan has been on full display. The Ulema Council, a government-supported body of religious leaders, issued a statement on several issues, including the recent burning of copies of the Quran at a U.S. military base. The longest part of the statement, however, gave religious guidance on how women should be treated and should behave. The statement said some good things. It prohibited a traditional practice of giving a girl to another family to resolve a dispute (\"baad\"). It spoke against forced marriage. It confirmed women's rights to inherit and own property. On women's duties, however, the statement took a turn for the worse:  Women should not travel without a male chaperone. Women should not mix with men while studying, or working, or in public. Women must wear the Islamic hijab. Women are secondary to men. If this was just the view of conservative religious leaders, it would be discouraging, but just another in a long line of discriminatory statements about women from Afghanistan's male dominated institutions. What caused consternation, however, was the sense that President Hamid Karzai had embraced the statement. In a departure from usual practice, the statement was posted on the Presidential Palace website, distributed to the media by the Palace, and defended by President Karzai at a news conference. President Karzai has a mixed record on women's rights. He committed Afghanistan to an international convention promising equal rights for women and pushed through by decree the 2009 law making violence against women a crime. He recently spoke out on two high-profile cases of violence against women. On the other hand, in the run-up to the 2009 presidential election he curried favor with hard-liners by signing the Shia Personal Status Law, which, for Afghanistan's Shia minority, gives a husband the right to withdraw maintenance from his wife, including food, if she refuses to obey sexual demands, grants guardianship of children exclusively to men, and requires women to have permission from their husbands to work. Some women fear that Karzai is using the Ulema Council statement to send a message about what compromises he is ready to make with the Taliban. With international interest in Afghanistan waning, negotiations with the Taliban in the offing, and Karzai's endorsement of the Ulema Council's statement, Afghan women are more vulnerable than at any time in the past 10 years. Now President Obama and other backers of the Afghan government should make it clear that they will not support any deals that sacrifice women's rights, and press Karzai to make his position clear. The risks for Afghan women are too high to do anything less.\n### Response:", "target": "Afghan women's rights have improved in the last 10 years but problems persist .\nHarassment, forced marriage and domestic violence are still widespread .\nReligious leaders issued a statement this week on how women should behave .\nThey said that women shouldn't travel without a male chaperone or mix with men in public .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Read the following passage and summarize it.\n### Input:(CNN) -- It's clear that we can't go 24 hours without Sarah Palin saying something so stupid that it defies logic, but leave it to the Kim Kardashian of politics to find something wrong with first lady Michelle Obama's effort to curb obesity in America's kids. In a radio interview on Wednesday with conservative talker Laura Ingraham, Palin took dead aim at the first lady's \"Let's Move\" initiative, which is all about getting children active and involved in exercise and healthy eating. In the wacky world of Wasilla's finest, Palin tries to cast the effort to fight obesity as part of Michelle Obama's \"different worldview.\" Here is a portion of the transcript from HuffingtonPost.com: \"Take her anti-obesity thing that she is on. She is on this kick, right. What she is telling us is she cannot trust parents to make decisions for their own children, for their own families in what we should eat. \"And I know I'm going to be again criticized for bringing this up, but instead of a government thinking that they need to take over and make decisions for us according to some politician or politician's wife priorities, just leave us alone, get off our back and allow us as individuals to exercise our own God-given rights to make our own decisions and then our country gets back on the right track.\" Hmmm. \"Let's Move\" is Obama's \"kick?\" Maybe someone should kick Sarah Palin so she can understand how devastating obesity is to the future of the United States. According to the first lady's \"Let's Move\" website: . \u2022 Obesity rates among children have tripled in the last three decades, and one in three children are obese. \u2022 One-third of all children born after 2000 will suffer from diabetes. \u2022 Children are less active today than at any other time in American history, spending 7.5 hours a day watching TV, playing video games or simply involved in efforts that don't require movement. \u2022 Obesity is contributing to the vast increase in hypertension among Americans. Now, since Palin is always talking about our nation's military and how we have to honor them and show them love and affection, let's listen to what a group of generals said a few months ago about obesity and America's national defense. A study released in April by Mission: Readiness, a nonprofit group of more than 150 retired generals and admirals, concluded that 27 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds are too fat to join the military. The culprit? Junk food and too much fat in school lunches. Said the study: \"Today, otherwise excellent recruiting prospects, some of them with generations of sterling military service in their family history, are being turned away because they are just too overweight. Our standards are high because we clearly cannot have people in our command who are not up to the job. Too many lives depend on it.\" In testimony before Congress, the former head of the California Army National Guard, retired U.S. Army Major Gen. Paul Monroe, said that \"80 percent of children who were overweight between the ages of 10 to 15 were obese by age 25.\" He and other military leaders want Congress to enact a massive child nutrition bill to remove all junk food and high-calorie beverages from schools, improve nutrition standards in schools, upgrade school menus and, the group said, \"help develop new school-based strategies, based on research, that help parents and children adopt healthier lifelong eating and exercise habits.\" Monroe testified: \"In 1946, Congress passed the National School Lunch Act as a matter of national security. In the past, retired admirals and generals have stood up to make it clear that America is only as healthy as our nation's children. Childhood obesity is now undermining our national security and we need to start turning it around today.\" So, Sarah Palin, are you going to also rip into this decorated American and say that he and 150 other military leaders are dead wrong? I recently sat down with Michelle Obama for a prime time special on TV One cable network dedicated to her \"Let's Move\" initiative. It was startling to listen to her talk about the horrible statistics and the shape we'll be in in the future, figuratively and literally. \"The crisis that we're facing around childhood obesity hits everything,\" Obama said. \"It's about education, what our kids are learning about nutrition in the schools, the quality of the food in the schools. It's about our neighborhood development. How are neighborhoods designed? \"Are our kids -- do they have access to safe places to play? Are we structuring communities in a way that facilitates healthy living? Are there accessible and affordable healthy foods in our communities? And it's about economic opportunity as well, because if folks can't afford to put food on the table, then they're eating what they can. \"So this is one of those issues that requires us to talk about a little bit of everything. And it makes us look at ourselves a little more closely and it makes us look at the broader society. So we're beginning to understand this is a threat.\" This latest broadside by Palin shows how reckless and ridiculous she is. Libertarians and far right conservative Republicans are always talking about government intrusion into our lives, but when we look at clean water, air quality and food supply, thank God for governmental standards. Don't think for a second I'm not paying attention. I've increased my health awareness, am changing my diet and working out more to lose weight, and am pushing family members to do the same. That's really the whole point of Michelle Obama's \"Let's Move.\" Any Republican with common sense should see that Sarah Palin poses an immediate threat to the future of this country. She proves that every time she opens her mouth. Sarah, for the benefit of the nation, stick a fork in it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.\n### Response:", "target": "Roland Martin says Sarah Palin slammed Michelle Obama's \"Let's Move\" anti-obesity campaign .\nHe says Obama's site says obesity tripled in 30 years, diabetes in kids is up .\nHe says a group of generals told Congress increasingly people are too overweight to serve .\nMartin: Palin's comments show she is reckless about the nation's health .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction: Give me a one line summary of the story below:\n### Input:(CNN) -- A writer commissioned to help launch a new \"Adventures of Superman\" digital comics series is drawing controversy for the comics' publisher not for his perception of the Man of Steel, but for his perception of marriage -- specifically, his opposition to same-sex marriage. Science fiction writer Orson Scott Card has been commissioned by longtime \"Superman\" publisher DC Comics to write a two-part story launching its new \"Adventures of Superman\" digital series. Card is perhaps best known for the classic 1985 sci-fi novel \"Ender's Game,\" but he also has sparked controversy with his outspoken criticism of homosexuality and same-sex marriage. \"Just because you give legal sanction to a homosexual couple and call their contract a 'marriage' does not make it a marriage,\" Card wrote in a 2004 essay titled \"Homosexual 'Marriage' and Civilization.\" The essay concluded, \" ... either civilized people will succeed in establishing a government that protects the family...or the politically correct barbarians will have complete victory over the family -- and, lacking the strong family structure on which civilization depends, our civilization will collapse or fade away.\" News that Card would be among writers on the new \"Adventures of Superman\" digital comics prompted marriage-equality group AllOut.org to launch a petition drive aimed at DC Comics. \"By hiring Orson Scott Card despite his anti-gay efforts you are giving him a new platform and supporting his hate,\" reads the petition -- now with nearly 12,000 signatures, according to the group. Card is no stranger to comic-book writing. He has written for Marvel Comics, penning series such as \"Ultimate Iron Man\" and comics based on his own \"Ender's Game\" among others. The new \"Adventures of Superman\" is not DC Comics' long-running, flagship \"Superman\" comic books but an ongoing digital anthology series of short stories about the hero that will be written by various authors. DC Comics, a division of Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, issued a statement Wednesday defending its decision to include Card among the writers. \"As content creators we steadfastly support freedom of expression, however the personal views of individuals associated with DC Comics are just that -- personal views -- and not those of the company itself,\" the statement said. Card declined to comment to CNN. Mitch Cutler, whose store, St. Mark's Comics has been open in New York City's East Village neighborhood for nearly 30 years, seemed to agree. \"Someone did tweet to us about boycotting the series, but since the first day (we opened) we have been committed to carrying everything we can in comics,\" Cutler said. \"I'm sure right now on the shelves there is content I might not necessarily agree with. So while I understand Mr. Card may have advocated things that might upset people, it would be very uncharacteristic of us to refuse to carry something for that reason.\" Jermaine Exum who manages Acme Comics in Greensboro, North Carolina -- the city where Card lives -- has a slightly different reason for deciding to carry the comics. \"Our main focus is that other creators are working on this,\" including artists like Jeff Parker who has ties to Acme, Exum said. \"The public is running away with the Orson Scott Card story, but I don't want to short-change these other people working on the series.\" Phil Jimenez, an openly gay writer and comic-book artist who has worked on \"Astonishing X-men,\" \"Captain America Corps,\" \"The Amazing Spiderman\" and more, is not OK with the decision, and believes Card's stance on homosexuality and same-sex marriage takes away certain people's civil rights. \"I'm encouraging people not to buy his work because when they do they actively support a foully bigoted man who uses his power and influence to affect public policy,\" Jimenez tweeted. Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, which has actively campaigned against same-sex marriage efforts and which counts Card as a member of its board of directors, says protesting Card's comics is un-American. \"For a movement that says it's focused on civil rights, it's surprising that supporters of gay marriage want to attack an opposing viewpoint and become violent,\" Brown told CNN. The decision to include Card comes at a time when the world of comics, while sometimes still criticized for over-sexualizing female characters, has moved to make homosexual characters a big part of storylines. In July 2012, in the second issue of \"Earth 2,\" a new series in DC Comics' \"The New 52,\" reimagining of many classic DC characters, Alan Scott, the first Green Lantern is an openly gay man. The series, along with DC's Batwoman, is up for a 2013 Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) Media Award. Marvel Comics had its first same-sex wedding in a June 2012 issue of \"Astonishing X-Men\" with superhero Northstar -- the first major comic-book character to come out as gay in 1992 -- marrying his longtime partner, Kyle.

{"source": "### Instruction: Can you give me the gist of this text?Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- Working conditions for South Asian migrant workers have improved on Abu Dhabi's Saadiyat Island, but more needs to be done and protection gaps remain, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Wednesday. In an 85-page report, the rights groups said those gaps include \"reimbursing workers for recruiting fees, which often take months or years to repay and are the single greatest factor in creating conditions of forced labor.\" The report also found \"lapses in effectively punishing abusive contractors and following through on promises to make monitoring reports public.\" Saadiyat Island, a $22 billion cultural project, will include local branches of New York University, as well as the Louvre and Guggenheim Museums. \"For too long, migrant workers in the UAE have toiled in abusive conditions, with private and public developers showing little concern,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \"Now, finally, Emirati developers and their international partners have stepped up to the plate on Saadiyat Island to start to protect workers, but they will need to do more to curtail the abuses.\" HRW first reported on the subject in 2009, when they found widespread exploitation of laborers on Saadiyat Island. The rights group says there have been notable improvements since then, citing \"commitments by leading educational and cultural bodies and UAE development companies to ensure regular payment of wages, rest breaks and days off, and employer-paid medical insurance, and to hire independent monitors to detect and report publicly on violations of workers' rights on the island.\" But today's progress report noted that many workers still pay recruitment fees in order to obtain their jobs, adding that almost all the 47 workers interviewed reported paying between $900 and $3,350 to agents in their home countries, a practice that can trap them in debt. The report also found contractors are \"regularly confiscating worker passports and substituting worker contracts with less favorable ones when the workers arrive in the UAE.\" In a response to HRW's report, Tourism Development & Investment Company (TDIC), the island's master developer, said they continue \"to be deeply committed to safeguarding worker welfare on its projects\". In a statement TDIC added that while the company is pleased to see HRW acknowledging the high standards they continue to uphold in the area of worker welfare, they also believe that \"some of the findings detailed are outdated and inaccurate, as the report cites interviews conducted between October 2010 and January 2011.\" The statement added: \"Moreover, the company believes the methodology HRW has used in the report is flawed; we call into question the small sample of workers interviewed, as well as the limited number of contractors these workers represent. TDIC therefore firmly believes that this report is not an accurate reflection of the current situation on Saadiyat.\" With regard to recruitment fees, TDIC said that they share HRW's concern, but that the fees continue to be a challenge. \"This practice mainly occurs in the worker's country of origin,\" said TDIC, \"making it an extremely difficult problem to address from the UAE. However, as according to TDIC's employment practices policy, should any worker prove they have been charged fees by an agency to work on any of its projects, the company will take appropriate action under its agreement with the relevant contractor to reimburse the worker. By focusing solely on Saadiyat, HRW is shifting the spotlight away from this important issue rather than trying to address it at its core. TDIC therefore encourages HRW to take the lead role in campaigning against this damaging practice on a wider scale and will fully support it in doing so.\" A statement from New York University Abu Dhabi said that \"HRW's latest report acknowledges the major steps that we and our government partners have taken to ensure the health and welfare of the individuals who are building NYU Abu Dhabi's new campus on Saadiyat Island.\" Josh Taylor, assistant vice chancellor, public affairs and community relations for NYU Abu Dhabi, added: \"We also welcome any new, actionable information that will enable us to accomplish our goals on this front. However, whereas our third-party compliance auditors conduct worker interviews each and every month, it appears that HRW's latest report relies on interviews that took place between 14 and 17 months ago. In a number of cases, the report also fails to indicate which project an individual was working on, which makes researching and/or addressing specific claims virtually impossible.\"\n### Response:", "target": "Human Rights Watch says more needs to be done to improve working conditions .\nThe report found \"lapses in effectively punishing abusive contractors\"\nThe report noted many workers still pay recruitment fees in order to obtain their jobs .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.As football's top event kicks off in Brazil, Anthony Pereira dispels some of the myths surrounding the 2014 World Cup's host country -- and its approach to the game it is showcasing. MYTH: Many Brazilians are in the mood to party . REALITY: Many thought that the awarding of the finals -- and the 2016 Olympics in Rio -- would be a \"coming out\" party for Brazil, confirming its new status as a global player. But that is not the atmosphere which seems to be taking hold. For the last year there have been protests over the spiraling costs of the tournament (around $11.5 billion) and government priorities. Many Brazilians have demanded \"FIFA standard\" hospitals, schools, and public transportation, not just stadiums. In 1950, the last time Brazil hosted a World Cup, Brazilians seemed to conform more readily to the stereotype of festive, soccer-mad nationalists (still to be found in some international media). Brazil in 1950 was a largely agrarian country, aspiring to national development and global influence but without the wealth and stature it has today. Back then, most Brazilians' anxieties seem to have been about football. The country was ready to crown its national team, the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, as world champions. Brazil's loss to Uruguay in the final in the newly built Maracan\u00e3 stadium (then the largest in the world) was seen as a disaster by many, and a confirmation of what the playwright and football commentator Nelson Rodrigues described as Brazilians' \"mongrel complex\" (complexo de vira-lata) or sense of inferiority. Now you've got an 85% urban country with high rates of literacy, growing wealth and universal primary school enrollment. So this is a country that's really been transformed over the last six decades. Young people, in particular, seem untroubled by an inferiority complex and are globally aware. They are not afraid to take to the streets to complain. MYTH: Brazilians are naturally good at football . REALITY: Many people are taken aback by the fact that Brazil has the unique claim of having won the World Cup five times, and participated in all the finals. You could offer an essentialist explanation: \"well, it's because of the mixture of races, because Brazilians like music, the culture of street football and because they're so passionate. It means they're just naturally so tricky and skilful.\" The more plausible explanation is that the state invested heavily in football as a means of gaining prestige and asserting identity. So it's a state project which has borne fruit. The epitome of the state's exploitation of Brazilian football expertise was the repressive dictatorship's propaganda attempts to associate itself with the success of the Brazilian team in the 1970 World Cup finals. I think when some people protest now, they are maybe (unconsciously) associating this Cup with that authoritarian project -- and rejecting it. MYTH: The stadiums will be packed across the country . REALITY: There are 12 cities taking part. One of these, Amazonas state capital Manaus is about 4,500 miles from Rio. FIFA itself did not require that so many cities be involved but the Brazilian government was conscious it should not be held in a few selected cities. Instead it should be shared regionally. That's characteristic of Brazilian political style. But it has meant huge stadia have been constructed in some places that probably will not fill them often, including Cuib\u00e1, Mato Grosso. These stadia could look like crumbling white elephants in a few years, leaving a negative legacy in some cities and a growing indignation. MYTH: A World Cup win equates to ballot box success . REALITY: The presidential election between the incumbent President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers' Party (PT) and her two main opponents, A\u00e9cio Neves of the Social Democratic Party (PSDB) and Eduardo Campos of the Socialist Party (PSB) will kick into full gear after the final on July 13. President Rousseff would like a successful, well-organized Cup to bolster her re-election chances, although she probably does not need the Brazilian team to do well in order to win. Candidates Neves and Campos could benefit from a perception that the Cup did not go well, but they probably will not be able to make too much of this in the campaign, as they both helped to organize it in their home states. MYTH: Brazil has fallen out of love with football . REALITY: In 2014, Brazil's passion for football is still evident. Brazilians have purchased the majority of the 2.5 million tickets despite high prices. Some local protests will likely happen but probably not on the scale of last year. People are wary of being seen as disloyally \"anti-World Cup\" and the government is alert to respond to any disruption. With international attention, there is too much at stake. In 1968, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II visited Brazil where she watched a match at the Maracan\u00e3 stadium and met Pel\u00e9. Then-British Ambassador John Russell noted its importance as \"football is the soul of Brazil.\" But is it? Perhaps, but that soul shares football with other passions, including desire for more democracy and less corruption. It could be said that protests have added to pressure on FIFA leading to the current questioning of the Qatari bid for the 2022 World Cup, and investigation. In this sense Brazilians are playing an important role in world football, not simply in their traditional role as brilliant players and passionate fans, but as protesters against and reformers of what many allege is a corrupt institution of global governance.\n### Response :", "target": "Many thought awarding of finals would be a \"coming out\" party for Brazil, writes Anthony Pereira .\nBut that is not the atmosphere which seems to be taking hold, he writes .\nBrazil in 1950 was without the wealth and stature it has today .\nBrazilians are playing an important role in football as protesters and reformers .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

When is Women's History Month? What are the origins of Women's History Month? What do you think is the goal of recognizing Women's History Month? 2. Do you think that women are underrepresented in any aspects of modern American life? Explain. Can you think of any professions in which women outnumber men? If so, what are they and why do you think that this is the case in these professions? 3. What names come to mind when you think of women who have had an impact on U.S. history?  What were their specific contributions or achievements?  What can we learn from each of these women? 4. Can you think of any female role models that have had an impact on your life? If so, how have these women influenced you? Learning Activities . Use these activities to encourage your students to learn about and appreciate the history and achievements of women in America. 1. Women's History Month Proclamation . Every year since 1980, the U.S. president has issued a proclamation regarding Women's History Month. Have students consult the Presidential Proclamation section of the White House website to read recent presidential proclamations on Women's History Month. Instruct students to create proclamations of their own using this year's theme, \"Our History is Our Strength\". 2. Women in Government . Have students conduct online research to generate a list of some of the women currently holding positions in government, including, but not limited to, U.S. Supreme Court justices, state governors, members of the president's cabinet, and members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Have each student select one of these women to research. Direct students to create a classroom or online exhibit that highlights each woman's experiences and achievements, and illustrates how her position of power may affect the lives of other Americans. 3. Witness to History . What if CNN had been there to record the events surrounding the women's suffrage movement? Guide students as they use the Internet to research the struggle for women's voting rights. Tell students to use the following questions as their guide: . \u2022 What were the major events that led to the ratification of the 19th Amendment? \u2022 Who were the key players on both sides of the women's suffrage issue? \u2022 What arguments were presented both for and against women's voting rights? Have students develop scripts for a broadcast news story on one aspect of this movement, ensuring that students include viewpoints from both the movement's supporters and its critics. 4. Women's History Memorial . Divide your class into small teams and assign each team one of the following fields: science, community, government, literature, art, entertainment, the military, sports and medicine. Next, instruct teams to research the roles that women have played in their assigned fields throughout American history. After teams present their information, instruct the full class to design a new memorial in Washington, D.C. that focuses on the contributions of women to American history. Standards . Social Studies . II. Time, Continuity, and Change . Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of the ways human beings view themselves in and over time. V. Individuals, Groups and Institutions . Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of interactions among individuals, groups, and institutions.

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?\n### Input:LONDON, England (CNN) -- \"Do you ever listen to stories? You do. You don't even know you do. Also you tell stories all the time.\" Doris Lessing receives the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2007 at the age of 88. Very neatly, master storyteller and Nobel Prize-winner Doris Lessing spells out mankind's addiction to storytelling. Stories occur naturally to people in one form or another, and finding reasons for their existence is unnecessary, according to the 89 year-old author. \"It is so deep in all of us. Storytelling is obviously some part of our minds, because it's always going on in one way or another.\" Lessing regards her own propensity for telling stories as a lifelong duty. Born to British parents in Persia (now Iran,) she began writing at seven, and says it was her innate capacity for it, rather than inspiration which got her started. \"I was born to write, as other people are born to paint ... that's all,\" she says, \"Writers tell stories. This is what we do.\" Much of Lessing's fiction is based on her experiences growing up in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), where she moved as a young child. She was raised on storytelling in the time-honored fashion -- she was read to and told stories by her mother, going on to spin her own tales for her younger brother. As she grew older these childhood stories somehow morphed into the powerful fiction she has become known for, bravely tackling the harsh social and political realities of her upbringing. Her first novel, \"The Grass is Singing\" was published in 1950 after she moved to London, and fearlessly dissects the tension between oppressed black Africans and white colonials. Arguably her most famous and influential work, \"The Golden Notebook,\" meanwhile is held by many critics as one of the most important feminist novels ever written. When she was awarded the Nobel prize for Literature last December, the Swedish academy called her \"the epicist of the female experience\" who had \"subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny.\" Lessing's prodigious writing skills are all the more impressive since they are largely self-taught. Her formal education ended at age 13 when she dropped out of a school in the Rhodesian capital Salisbury, and she left home at 15 to work as a nursemaid but remained a voracious reader -- \"I educated myself by reading.\" She also started writing stories and later sold two of them to magazines in South Africa. Lessing has never forgotten the importance of reading as a way to educate yourself  (\"you know there are some people in the world who still do\") and feels strongly about helping people in developing countries to gain access to books. \"[There are] places where there is no proper education. In large parts of Africa for example, you find them begging for books.\" In her acceptance speech on receiving the Nobel Prize, she painted moving pictures of the desperate struggle for knowledge people in some developing countries still endure: . \"Not long ago a friend who had been in Zimbabwe told me about a village where people had not eaten for three days, but they were still talking about books and how to get them, about education.\" She strongly advocates storytelling as an essential part of childhood, and claims there is a distinguishable difference between the attitudes of people who grew up reading books, and that of those who grew up with television and whose parents feel television and the Internet are satisfactory substitutes. People brought up on books are \"infinitely better informed, better educated\" than those who don't have a genuine passion for reading instilled in them, says Lessing. The storyteller, on the other hand, needs to be aware of the potential power of their words. Lessing has firm principles about her work: \"I don't write what I don't believe, or I don't write anything which I think is wrong.\" This uncompromising attitude coupled with her anti-apartheid campaigning helped get her and her books banned from Rhodesia and South Africa in the 1950s. Half a century later the left-wing radical has become a grand old lady of the literary scene. Unimaginably, her latest book, \"Alfred and Emily,\" released this year, will be her last. The book presents the effect of World War I on her parents, and in the first of the novel she imagines what their lives would have been like had that terrible event never happened. \"For my father it was easy, he always wanted to be a farmer, in Essex, or Suffolk, or somewhere. So I've given him the life he wanted. And my mother, who was an extremely clever woman -- I've given her a life where she could use all these abilities, which she never had the chance to do in her own life.\" The second half is a more faithful account of their experiences during the war, and how distant they were from the lives they wanted. Perhaps her graceful exit with \"Alfred and Emily\" was intended to demonstrate a deeper value to storytelling. Much more than an exercise in imagination or controversy, it opens the door to an endless universe of second chances.\n### Response :", "target": "Writer Doris Lessing spells out mankind's dependence on stories .\nLessing on storytelling: \"It's always going on in one way or another.\"\nHer own life is itself a great story: born in Persia, she grew up in southern Africa .\nThe Nobel prizewinner says her latest novel \"Alfred and Emily\" will be her last .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction :How would you encapsulate this?\n### Input: INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Ten victims of former Subway pitchman Jared Fogle have received a total of $1 million in restitution since he agreed to plead guilty to child pornography and sex-crime charges, and his four other victims could receive their checks by the time he is sentenced next month \u2014 a move prosecutors said is rare. \n  \n FILE - In this Aug. 19, 2015 file photo Former Subway restaurant spokesman Jared Fogle leaves the Federal Courthouse in Indianapolis following a hearing on child-pornography charges. Ten victims of Fogle,... (Associated Press) \n  \n The $100,000 checks were hand-delivered to each of the 10 victims or their parents over the last several weeks, with each signing a form saying they had received the money and that it is intended to benefit that particular victim, Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven DeBrota told The Associated Press on Thursday. \n  \n DeBrota said he's handled only one other case in which restitution was paid to victims before sentencing in nearly a quarter-century of prosecuting child porn cases. \n  \n By the time a federal judge sentences Fogle on Nov. 19 to a minimum of five years in prison, DeBrota said prosecutors expect to have either presented $100,000 checks to Fogle's four other victims or have plans in place to disburse those funds to them. \n  \n That money will pay for mental health counseling, medical care and other needs the 14 victims might have now or in the future to help them recover from the trauma. Three adults and seven minors had received their checks as of Thursday. DeBrota said that money will help them \"go on with their lives and put them where they should have been had none of this happened.\" \n  \n Fogle agreed on Aug. 19 to plead guilty to one count each of travelling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor and distribution and receipt of child pornography. Prosecutors have agreed not to seek a sentence of more than 12\u00bd years in prison and Fogle agreed not to ask for less than five years. \n  \n Carol Hepburn, a Seattle attorney who has helped several child porn victims pursue restitution, said the vast majority of restitution orders in those cases are never fully paid. She said she hopes the disgraced spokesman's wealth and quick restitution to his victims will have no impact on the length of his sentence. \n  \n \"I would hope that justice is equal for those who have money as well as those who don't,\" Hepburn said. \n  \n Fogle became a Subway spokesman more than 15 years ago after shedding more than 200 pounds as a college student, in part by eating the chain's sandwiches. Subway ended its relationship with Fogle after authorities raided his suburban Indianapolis home in July. \n  \n Court documents detailing the charges against Fogle say that he had sex at New York City hotels with two girls under age 18 \u2014 one of whom was 16 at the time \u2014 and paid them for that sex. \n  \n Both of those victims are now adults over 18, as are two of the 12 youths prosecutors said were victimized by Fogle's failure to alert authorities that an associate of his was allegedly producing child pornography of those minors using hidden cameras. \n  \n Prosecutors allege Russell Taylor, the former director of a foundation Fogle created to raise awareness and money to fight childhood obesity, secretly filmed those minors as they were nude, changing clothes, or engaged in other activities. \n  \n DeBrota said Fogle \u2014 a 38-year-old father of two \u2014 received photos and videos from Taylor of several of those 12 youths, although not all of them. He said Fogle nonetheless played a role in victimizing all of them because he knew they were minors \u2014 some as young as 13 or 14 \u2014 but failed to alert authorities who could have prevented Taylor from victimizing some of them. \n  \n Hepburn said that for most crime victims, time puts a growing distance from the crime itself and its victims, allowing them to recover. But child porn victims, some of whom are forced into sex, face ongoing trauma for years because that material continues to circulate on the Internet, keeping them in fear that others, possibly friends or co-workers, might discover those online. \n  \n \"Imagine your most humiliating and shameful and terrifying experience and having not only pictures but videos of that up on the Internet? It's a very chilling prospect,\" she said. \n  \n By the time prosecutors signed their plea deal with Fogle, he had transferred the agreed-on $1.4 million in restitution to the law firm representing him, which in turn placed it in a trust account that federal prosecutors are tapping to pay his victims, DeBrota said. \n  \n Fogle attorney Jeremy Margolis said in an August statement after Fogle signed his plea deal that \"Jared fully recognizes that such monetary contribution will not undo the harm he has caused\" but hopes it can help \"these individuals as they try to move forward with their lives.\" \n  \n Fogle's attorneys said Thursday they had no comment on the distribution of that money. \n  \n ___ \n  \n This version of the story corrects the name of Fogle attorney Jeremy Margolis. ||||| Fogle agreed on Aug. 19 to plead guilty to one count each of travelling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor and distribution and receipt of child pornography.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?\n### Input:Islambad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two prominent Pakistani Muslim leaders threatened Wednesday to call for nationwide protests if the president pardons a Christian woman sentenced to death for insulting the Muslim prophet Mohammed. \"If the president pardons Asia Bibi, we will raise our voices across the country until he is forced to take his decision back,\" nationally known mufti Muneer Ur Rehman said. Hafiz Ibtisam Elahi Zaheer, a leading cleric in Lahore, said pardoning the woman would be \"criminal negligence\" and would cause inter-religious tension. Punjab Gov. Salman Taseer told CNN Tuesday that President Asif Ali Zardari would pardon Bibi if the High Court did not grant her request for mercy. Bibi, who has been jailed for nearly 15 months, was convicted in a Pakistani court earlier this month of breaking the country's controversial blasphemy law by insulting Islam's Prophet Mohammed, a crime punishable with death or life imprisonment, according to Pakistan's penal code. She was sentenced to death. A spokesman for Zardari said Wednesday that no action has been taken, but the president will pardon her if necessary. \"No decision has been taken,\" spokesman Farhatullah Babar said. \"Under the constitution, the president has to act under the advise of the prime minister. He will advise the president to take whatever action he proposes.\" Babar said jurists and legal experts have debated about whether the president has absolute power under the constitution to grant a pardon. But he said Bibi is not in danger of being executed. \"Asia cannot be executed now,\" Babar said. \"Under the law, a death sentenced issued by a session court can not be carried out until it has been endorsed by the high court.\" Farahnaz Ispahani, a spokeswoman for the president, said Pakistan remains committed to protecting religious minorities. \"Pakistan is a nation of many faiths and religions, and all Pakistanis, no matter what their religion, are equal under the law,\" Ispahani said in a written statement. \"President Zardari has followed the case of Asia Bibi closely and will take appropriate action, if necessary, to issue a pardon or grant clemency to insure that Asia Bibi is neither incarcerated or harmed.\" A preliminary investigation showed Bibi was falsely accused, a government official said Monday. \"The president asked me to investigate her case, and my preliminary findings show she is innocent and the charges against her are baseless,\" Pakistani Minister for Minority Affairs Shahbaz Bhatti told CNN. Bhatti has said he will submit a final report Wednesday to Zardari's office. Prosecutors say Bibi, a 45-year-old field worker, insulted the Prophet Mohammed after she got into a heated argument with Muslim co-workers who refused to drink from a bucket of water she had touched because she is not Muslim. In a brief news conference at the prison where she's being held, Bibi said last weekend that the allegations against her are lies fabricated by a group of women who don't like her. \"We had some differences and this was their way of taking revenge,\" she said. Bibi's death sentence sparked outrage among human rights groups, who condemned Pakistan's blasphemy law as a source of violence and persecution against religious minorities. But Babar said the president's party lacks the power in parliament to repeal Pakistan's blasphemy laws. \"The manifesto of the Pakistan Peoples Party calls for the law to be repealed, but the party has not been able to repeal it because we lack the majority in parliament,\" Babar said. \"We don't have the numbers to do it.\" Pakistan is more than 96 percent Muslim, according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life.

One of the toughest spots to hit Brown this cycle, the 30-second ad paints the former senator from Massachusetts as a \"yes man\" to a large corporation that has outsourced jobs.

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.\n### Input:WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Supreme Court offered unanimous support for police Wednesday by allowing drug evidence gathered after an arrest that violated state law to be used at trial, an important search-and-seizure case turning on the constitutional limits of \"probable cause.\" The Supreme Court unanimously gave police broader powers to search for and seize evidence. \"When officers have probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime in their presence, the Fourth Amendment permits them to make an arrest, and to search the suspect in order to safeguard evidence and ensure their own safety,\" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote. David Lee Moore was stopped by Portsmouth, Virginia, officers five years ago for driving his vehicle on a suspended license. Under state law in such incidents, only a summons is to be issued and the motorist is to be allowed to go. Instead, detectives detained Moore for almost an hour, arrested him, then searched him and found cocaine. At trial, Moore's lawyers tried to suppress the evidence, but the state judge allowed it, even though the court noted the arrest violated state law. A police detective, asked why the man was arrested, replied, \"Just our prerogative.\" While some of the justices expressed concern about that level of discretion at oral arguments in January, their 9-0 ruling raised few such doubts. \"The arrest rules that the officers violated were those of state law alone,\" Scalia said. \"It is not the province of the Fourth Amendment to enforce state law.\" The state had argued an arrest is constitutionally reasonable if officers have probable cause to believe a suspect has committed a crime. \"This standard represents the best compromise between the needs of the citizens and the duty of the government to combat crime,\" Stephen McCullough, Virginia's deputy solicitor general, had told the high court. But Moore's attorney, Thomas Goldstein, called an \"extreme proposition\" the idea that it would be reasonable \"to go out and arrest someone for a non-arrestable offense and not only do that, but having committed that trespass at common law, to further search them.\" There has been widespread judicial confusion over how such police searches should be handled. Some lower courts had ruled that when state arrest law is violated, the Constitution provides a remedy in the suppression of any evidence resulting from the arrest and a related search. But the justices agreed with the majority of courts that said constitutional requirements are satisfied when an officer has probable cause to make an arrest, even if some provision of state law was violated in the process. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a concurring opinion suggesting Virginia change its law to make driving on a suspended license an arrestable offense. During arguments, Ginsburg spoke for several colleagues when she pointed out that if a summons had been issued in Moore's case, any incriminating evidence would have been excluded. \"Would you explain the logic to saying that when the police violate state law, then the evidence can come in, but when they comply with state law, it can't,\" she asked. The ruling means Moore's original jury conviction and 3-\u00bd year prison term will stand.

The controversy has erupted in Northern Ireland and was even discussed Tuesday by lawmakers in the province's elected Assembly in Belfast. Rihanna, who was born in Barbados but has Irish ancestry, is in Northern Ireland this week for sold-out shows at Belfast's Odyssey Arena. The 23-year-old had been given permission to film a video for the song \"We Found Love\" in a muddy barley field owned by farmer Alan Graham outside Bangor, about 10 miles from Belfast. Graham explained Tuesday, \"I didn't know who was coming. If the name 'Rihanna' had been mentioned, well, no disrespect, but it wouldn't have meant anything.\" However, he says that when he went to get his tractor Monday and saw the singer stripping down to a bikini top, he stepped in to end the shoot. The local political representative said he \"asked the film crew to stop, and they did.\" Graham insisted that \"there were no hard feelings.\" He added: \"I had a conversation with Rihanna; we shook hands; we parted company on good terms. I found her very gracious, and I hope she understands where I'm coming from. I wish her well.\" Word had quickly spread of Rihanna's surprise appearance in the Northern Irish countryside, and traffic came to a standstill as fans attempted to catch a glimpse of the star. Graham's wife shed more light on the incident Tuesday, revealing that Rihanna had gone topless. Said Mrs. Graham, who declined to give her first name, \"What she was doing became more inappropriate. When she started to go topless, that's what Alan was particularly objecting to -- things were getting out of hand. There was a man as well, and the behavior was getting more inappropriate. ... It wasn't the sort of thing Alan wanted young people (those watching) to see on his land. We are Christians.\" However, Mrs. Graham added: \"The girl was very nice; she shook hands with Alan several times\" after he asked for the filming to stop. Not to be deterred, Rihanna was back filming again in Belfast on Tuesday. But the controversy of the sexy shoot in the barley field rumbled on -- and even made it onto the agenda at the Northern Ireland Assembly. Graham is a local representative with the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (formerly led by Protestant preacher the Rev. Ian Paisley), and the Rihanna row led to a light-hearted exchange between lawmakers in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday. Mike Nesbitt, of rival pro-British party the Ulster Unionists, addressed Democratic Unionist leader Peter Robinson, Northern Ireland's first minister. Nesbitt said, \"I wonder if the first minister has had an opportunity to assess the potential damage from the news that the pop icon Rihanna was foiled in her filming ambitions yesterday, which I believe were no more sinister than appearing in a field in red, white and blue.\" (The latter are the colors of the British flag as well as the American one). Robinson replied, \"I'm pretty sure there was no problem with the colors involved!\" Robinson had just been telling the Assembly of his recent trade mission to the United States to encourage Hollywood studios to make more movies in Northern Ireland.\n### Response:", "target": "Pop singer was filming \"We Found Love\" video on farm outside Belfast .\nFarmer asked film crew to stop after he spotted Rihanna strip to bikini top .\nHis wife says the Barbados-born singer actually went topless .\nProvince's lawmakers even discussed the controversy .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?\n### Input:(CNN) -- Albert Einstein once said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Following a third exploratory round of bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea held in Beijing last week, Washington looks as though it is walking into yet another goodies-for-nuclear freeze deal with the reclusive North Koreans. The State Department announced Wednesday that the United States would provide food aid to North Korea in return for Pyongyang's promise to implement a moratorium on long-range missile launches, nuclear tests and its plutonium and uranium enrichment activities. North Korea also agreed to allow the return of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to verify and monitor the moratorium. Einstein, if he cared about the issue, would probably roll over in his grave. Why are we doing this? We have seen this playbook several times before in our 25-plus year history of trying to denuclearize North Korea. The United States gets pulled into providing food or energy indefinitely to maintain the nuclear freeze. The North Koreans eventually cheat on the freeze and undertake augmentation of their nuclear weapons at other undisclosed facilities. We stop providing the assistance. A hair-raising crisis ensues that is ultimately resolved through another assistance-for-freeze agreement. Wash, rinse, repeat. Political types might condemn it as insanity, naivet\u00c3\u00a9 or both. But there may be some common-sensical reasons for doing this. Practically speaking, the achievement of a nuclear and missile-testing moratorium, as well as the reintroduction of the U.N. nuclear-watchdog agency inspectors into Yongbyon, is a useful step. The uranium enrichment program currently meets the definition of a runaway nuclear program. It has gone unabated now for at least five years, if not longer. Getting eyes on the ground again, as in 1994 to 2002 and 2007 to 2008, is a welcome development. For North Korea, the young Kim Jong Un may want to demonstrate a continuity of leadership after the sudden death of his father nine weeks ago, and the regime wants food in preparation for its April 15 celebrations of the 100th birthday of the first leader of North Korea, Kim Il Sung. However, beyond these tactical solutions are longer-term strategic challenges. First, North Korea may temporarily halt their program, but the grim reality is that it will not part with it. Second, the IAEA inspectors will go into the facilities without a supporting U.N. Security Council resolution declaring that the uranium program is in violation of standing denuclearization agreements. (China opposed this.) So while the United States will see this move as monitoring a freeze, North Korea will see it as validating to the international community that it only has peaceful intentions with its uranium program. Third, it is too soon to tell whether this agreement means the junior Kim is turning over a new leaf and seeking to make nice with the world. Fourth, the slightest opening up of this brittle dictatorship under the untested son will ensure that it comes crumbling down -- something for which the United States, China and South Korea are wholly unprepared. Fifth, a nuclear freeze is a long way from the denuclearization objectives sought in the 2005 agreement at the so-called Six-Party Talks. Indeed, one of the unmet U.S. \"pre-steps\" for returning to the Six-Party Talks was a commitment by the North to refrain from further provocations such as the 2010 submarining of a South Korean navy ship and artillery shelling of a South Korean island. The North made no such commitments outside of a vague reference to supporting the 1953 armistice agreement that ceased Korean War hostilities. Finally, nongovermental and humanitarian groups probably chafe at the explicit linking of food assistance to the nuclear freeze. The United States would claim that the North insisted on the linkage. But it takes two to tango.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?\n### Input:Washington (CNN) -- Americans still strongly support airstrikes against ISIS -- but they're losing confidence that the strikes will wipe out the group's military capability, a new poll shows. The air strikes already ordered by President Barack Obama are supported by 76% of the public, a CNN/ORC International survey of 1,018 adults, conducted Oct. 24-26, found. However, only 48% of those polled say the U.S. effort is going well -- while 54% say they're confident the strikes will degrade and destroy the military capability of ISIS. That figure is down from 61% last month. As the public loses confidence in air strikes' effectiveness, Americans are increasingly supportive of sending U.S. ground troops to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The poll found 45% support for such a move -- up from 38% in September. A majority still oppose it however. And if ISIS were to attack the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, that number would shift much more dramatically, with 72% saying they'd then support sending ground troops to the region. \"Support for sending U.S. ground troops into combat operations against ISIS forces is growing, although a majority continues to oppose 'boots on the ground' in Iraq or Syria,\" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \"But that could change in a hurry if the situation worsens in Iraq.\" ISIS prisoners reveal life inside terror group . The poll also found a war-weary public with little faith in Obama, high confidence that a terrorist attack on U.S. soil will happen again soon and expectations that fighting ISIS will be a drawn-out engagement. Those surveyed said they aren't expecting to see ISIS quickly defeated. More than four in five said U.S. military action against the group will be long and difficult. Opinion: Is killing ISIS leader a good idea? Only 32% said they believe Obama has a clear plan for dealing with ISIS. Meanwhile, 59% said further acts of terrorism in the United States are likely over the next several weeks. That number is up from 55% in a September poll -- a small enough increase, Holland said, that it can't be attributed to a changed public mood after last week's attacks on the Canadian government.\n### Response :", "target": "76% of Americans support U.S. airstrikes on ISIS, a CNN/ORC International poll shows .\nBut just 54% say they're confident the strikes will destroy ISIS' military capability .\nThat figure has dropped 7 percentage points since September .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction: Can you give me a quick rundown?(CNN)Oregon State University's main library just went viral, and not because of its state-of-the-art computer lab. A 19-year-old woman was cited Tuesday evening for allegedly using the university library at the campus in Corvallis, Oregon, as a backdrop to shoot an adult video last year. The woman was cited for public indecency and released, according to Steve Clark, Oregon State vice president of university relations. She is not a current student but attended the school for the 2014 fall term. The former student's name was not released by the school, but an Oregon State Police log says that 19-year-old Kendra Jane Sunderland of Corvallis was cited for public indecency in connection with a video posted to a pornographic site along with the claim that it was shot in an Oregon State library. The log says the performer in the video engaged in a \"solo act.\" The misdemeanor charge could bring up to one year in jail and a $6,250 fine. CNN's attempts to reach Sunderland for comment weren't immediately successful. Clark said the university learned about the video Tuesday afternoon. Officials believe the video, which was published on the popular adult website Pornhub.com, was filmed in October on the sixth floor of OSU's Valley Library. \"The university does not condone such behavior. This type of behavior does not represent the values of the university. And it definitely does not represent the values of the more than 30,000 students and 5,000 employees that make up Oregon State University,\" said Clark.

{"source": "### Instruction:Produce an article summary of the following news article:Doc to summarize:(CNN)Who says you need a printer to churn out digital-quality images? The Human Printer, a project from graphic design duo Stinsensqueeze, is recreating this modern effect with decidedly old-school techniques. Louise Naunton Morgan and Stina Gromark use fine tip markers and endless patience to mimic the layered tonality of CMYK color printing, which uses cyan, magenta, yellow and black to create the full spectrum. (You may recognize these colors from your old printer cartridges.) However, the handmade component gives each print its own look and feel. \"With something handmade, you create unique experiences or unique art works, whereas digitally, you can produce it over and over again, and it's exactly the same,\" says Gromark. How it's made . Recreating an image seems both incredibly simple and frustratingly specific. Using a half-tone version of a digital image as their guide (imagine a picture broken down into tiny grayscale circles), the designers create four layers of tiny pen dots that correspond with the CMYK process colors. If done correctly, the dots should create the illusion of seamlessly blended colors and defined shapes. \"It's like what you see on a billboard: if you were to look really closely, you would see all of the individual dots,\" Naunton Morgan explains. \"The process is really very simple, just take care not to make lots of errors ... Anyone could do it.\" The amount of time needed to complete an image largely depends on the subject's complexity and the size of the dots (smaller dots create a more convincing optical illusion and take more time), but on average, it takes one person eight to 10 hours to fill a letter size sheet. Fusing the human and the digital . Naunton Morgan and Gromark first started the Human Printer in 2009 while studying at Central Saint Martins in London. As graphic design students, they often discussed human interaction with technology, and how the handmade relates to the digitally produced. \"You print an image for a digital print and it always has the same finish to it. Something that's handmade is much more unique, it's much more individual,\"  Naunton Morgan says. \"These ideas married themselves together and we were like 'Hey! What would happen if you were to do (digital printing) by hand?'\" Their peers' enthusiasm compelled them to extend the project beyond graduation, and Naunton Morgan and Gromark eventually absorbed it into their current design practice. (They currently operate out of London and Paris.) The future of prints . While they do accept commissions like a traditional printing service and have recently started selling prints online, Naunton Morgan and Gromark try to reposition their work in more creative ways. In September, they were invited to create their largest and most ambitious work yet at Unseen photo fair in Amsterdam. For four days, visitors watched Naunton Morgan, Gromark and a rotating team of five volunteers work in a glass cabin, dotting out a landscape on one of its 140 square foot walls. They've also released two books exploring human intervention in digital processes. Though they haven't confirmed what they'll try next, Gromark is happy to muse on the possibilities. \"Could we print in on another material? Could we explore the same process in a 3-D printer?\" she says. \"We're just trying to expand the way we see it.\" Replacing traditional printing, however, will never be the goal. The hours required to make a print by hand are wildly impractical in the face of today's instant printers, and no matter how much effort is made, it's impossible to get a true duplicate with markers. In fact, the Human Printer put this to the test last year by hand-printing the same image 20 times in a row. The prints were not identical, but they were inimitable. \"That's the nature of why it's called the Human Printer,\" says Naunton Morgan. \"It's about celebrating things that are handmade and do have errors, compared to those that are digitally produced.\" Is this the end of ambitious Chinese architecture?

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?\n### Input: The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane will be entering a new phase that will use private contractors and may cost about $60 million, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Monday. \"I regret to say that thus far none of our efforts in the air, on the surface or under sea, have found any wreckage,\" he said. The new phase will focus on searching the ocean floor over a much larger area -- 60,000 square kilometers, a process that will take about six to eight months. \"We do not want this crippling cloud of uncertainty to hang over this family and the wider traveling public,\" he said. It is \"highly unlikely\" that any debris will be found on the ocean surface, Abbott said. By this time, most of the debris will have become waterlogged and will have submerged, he said. As such, authorities will be suspending aerial searches. Words of praise . Malaysia's government has been widely criticized over its handling of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and disclosures of its investigations. But on Sunday, U.S. President Barack Obama had words of praise during a visit to the southeast Asian country. He said the Malaysian government has been \"forthcoming\" with the United States about the information it has. \"The Malaysian government is working tirelessly to recover the aircraft and investigate exactly what happened,\" Obama told reporters. He reiterated that the United States would continue to aid in the search and offered condolences to loved ones of those lost. Narrowed search nears end . Obama's visit came as the initial search by the Bluefin-21 neared its end. The submersible, which is on contract to the U.S. Navy, had been scouring the ocean floor for traces of the plane. Previously, another device, a towed pinger locator, detected signals that officials believed were from the jet's flight recorders, which determined the current search area for the Bluefin. The plane disappeared on March 8 after leaving Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for Beijing. Preliminary report . Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak  has said a preliminary report on the plane's disappearance will be available to the public next week. He also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week, his office said. The report has been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N. body for global aviation, but not yet made available to the public. The U.N. organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by Malaysia that the aviation world needs to look at real-time tracking of commercial aircraft. It's the same recommendation that was made after Air France Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. \"Anytime there is a tragedy like this, we ought to also reflect on what can be done going forward to prevent something similar from happening again,\" Obama said. \"That discussion has begun in Malaysia and around the world, and we'll see what improvements might be recommended to continue improving aviation security. One thing is already clear, however, is that large international efforts like this search operation benefit from existing partnerships among nations.\" Why didn't emergency beacon work?\n### Response :", "target": "New phase will take about six to eight months .\nAuthorities will be suspending aerial searches .\nBluefin-21 starts its 15th mission to search for missing plane's remains .\nSunday air and sea search suspended because of weather .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.\n### Input: (CNN) -- Former Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, who was ousted in a coup nearly two years ago, returned to his homeland Saturday. His plane touched down in the capital, Tegucigalpa, in the afternoon. Thousands of supporters cheered his arrival at the airport. While Zelaya has entered Honduras since the military roused him in his pajamas and sent him into exile, Saturday marked the first time he returned without fear of prosecution. Wearing his trademark cowboy hat, Zelaya addressed his supporters, calling on them to pursue peaceful, democratic change. \"The problem of poverty, of corruption ... will not be solved with violence, but through more democracy, greater citizen participation and better transparency,\" he told a roaring crowd. Zelaya this month inked an accord with the country's current president that allowed him to return. Most recently, he has been in exile in the Dominican Republic. The deal, which was brokered by the Colombian and Venezuelan governments, was signed in Cartagena, Colombia, by Zelaya and Honduran President Porfirio Lobo. It allowed Zelaya and his allies to return to Honduras and helps clear the way for the country to rejoin the Organization of American States. Zelaya and his supporters will also be permitted to participate in Honduran politics. \"I hope the reconciliation plan serves to unite the family of Honduras,\" Zelaya told CNN en Espanol, from the plane that took him to Honduras. \"I am a peaceful man. I am a Christian and I do not hold a grudge.\" He said he does not immediately intend to run for president. Zelaya, who alienated many by his insistence on pursuing constitutional changes that might have allowed him to seek re-election, nonetheless counts with many allies. His supporters in Tegucigalpa prepared banners and posters this week to pass out to those who would gather to welcome him back. Yet many others are not thrilled. Even several of the country's news networks refused to cover Zelaya's arrival. Cholusat Sur broadcast images of his return. \"I think that this will create more problems for the country,\" university student Daniel Melendez said prior to the former leader's arrival. \"There is going to be a repeat of what there was before.\" Zelaya was overthrown on June 28, 2009, and flown into exile. He sneaked back into Honduras in September of that year and got refuge in the Brazilian Embassy, where he remained holed up until Lobo arranged for Zelaya to get safe passage out of the country. Honduras has been excluded from the Organization of American States since the coup, in part because Zelaya had not been allowed to return home without fear of prosecution. He faced corruption charges, which were dropped this month. The de facto government that replaced Zelaya was eventually replaced by the elected government of Lobo. But because the election happened under the rule of the de facto forces, some countries have not recognized the election results. Many countries, including the United States, have recognized the Lobo government, while others, such as Brazil, have not. Zelaya's return to Honduras is expected to help further reintegrate Honduras into the international community.

Another walks down the street, defiantly showing off her hair and body in a revealing dress. And still another woman says she's not scared of paramilitary forces -- no matter how many times she gets beaten. Women have taken to the streets of Tehran. \"This shows the new face of Iran,\" one expert says. \"When they want to hit me, I say hit. I have been hit so many times and this time it doesn't matter. I just want to help my brothers and sisters,\" says the 19-year-old woman whose identity is being withheld by CNN for her safety. Amid the clashes and chaos, there has been a recurring scene on the streets of Tehran: Women, in their scarves and traditional clothing, at the heart of the struggle. Some are seen collecting rocks for ammunition against security forces, while video showed one woman trying to protect a fallen pro-government militiaman wounded in the government crackdown. At Shiraz University, riot police clubbed women dressed in black robes. \"Don't beat them, you bastards,\" one man yells. When security forces come to attack, the 19-year-old woman protester says she looks them in the eye and asks: \"Why do you kill your brother? Why do you hit your mother, your sisters?\" \"We all tell them, if you're Iranian, you shouldn't do that to your people, to your own country's people,\" she told CNN by phone.  Watch woman stand up in defiance to power \u00bb . But it's the woman known as Neda who has become the symbol of women on the front line that has galvanized opponents of the Iranian regime. In a widely circulated video, Neda is seen in the middle of protests over the weekend. She is shot and drops to the ground. Blood runs from the side of her mouth as a few people, including her music professor traveling with her, press on her chest and shout her name. One pleads, \"Do not be afraid.\" The camera closes in on her face as her eyes roll back and are still. Karim Sadjadpour, an associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the image of Neda and other women at the protests showed the difference from the 1979 revolution. \"The iconic pictures from the revolution 30 years ago were bearded men. This shows the new face of Iran -- the young women who are the vanguards of Iran.\"  See images of protests \u00bb . Abbas Milani, the director of Iranian Studies at Stanford University, agreed that Neda was becoming a symbol for all the women who have become involved in the turmoil that has followed the disputed election. \"She will become the image of this brutality and the role -- the truly significant role -- that women have played in fighting this regime. I think that women are the unsung heroes of the last few years. They are the ones who began chipping away the absolute authority of the mullahs.\" The protests haven't just been confined to Iran's everyday women. The daughter of former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was arrested over the weekend while taking part in a protest. She was later released. In addition, Zahra Rahnavard, the wife of Mir Hossein Moussavi, whose apparent defeat in Iran's presidential election has sparked the unprecedented demonstrations, campaigned for her husband, an unusual step in politics in Iran. Her public support of his candidacy underscored his professed support for women's rights.  Learn more about the timeline of events \u00bb . And in another act of defiance, apparently from after the election, a woman who appears to be in her 20s or 30s walks down a street in Tehran, showing off her body in a revealing dress and displaying her long, curly hair. In Iran, women are forbidden to show their hair, and they must keep their bodies covered. \"Lady, is it a revolution already?\" one female driver says as she passes by. The 19-year-old demonstrator, who spoke by phone with CNN, says women are out in the streets in much larger numbers than men. She provided CNN with images of paramilitary forces on Saturday confronting protests, just before she was beaten. She says she was beaten again during protests Monday. \"The women are all together and they say, 'We're going to stay here.' There are so more [women] than men,\" she said, referring to the number of women protesters. \"Until now, the women didn't have a chance to express themselves, to say that we are important in our country's future. But now, they can play an important role in our freedom. It's a good chance for us.\" Is she optimistic? \"I'm absolutely optimistic, because history has taught me that all the revolutions start like this,\" she said. \"Every revolution has violence and some people die, but nothing stays like this forever.\" CNN's Ivan Watson and Wayne Drash contributed to this report.\n### Response: ", "target": "Recurring theme of Iranian protests: Women defiantly standing up against authority .\n19-year-old woman says, \"When they want to hit me, I say hit.\"\nA young woman named Neda has become the rallying cry of protesters .\n\"This shows the new face of Iran -- the young women who are the vanguards of Iran\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?(CNN) -- George Hochsprung's world began to crumble Friday when one of the students at the Connecticut middle school where he works walked up to him. Something was happening at the elementary school less than 10 miles away where Hochsprung's wife was principal, the student said, holding a computer. There were reports his wife had been killed. Hochsprung rushed out of the building, one of dozens of family members of students and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, desperately seeking information about their loved ones that day. His wife, Dawn, was in a meeting that morning when a 20-year-old local man blasted his way into the elementary school armed with three guns. She stepped out of the meeting to find out what was going on and never returned. She was among the 26 people shot and killed inside the school by the gunman, Adam Lanza, who then turned a weapon on himself. Twenty of the dead were children. As people across the world struggle to comprehend Lanza's atrocious acts, George Hochsprung has been left with a future that no longer makes sense. He is more than 20 years older than his wife, who was 47 when she died. He never imagined he would outlive her. \"Dawn and I built this beautiful house in the Adirondacks, our dream,\" he said in an interview Sunday night, sitting on a couch surrounded by his three daughters and one of his stepdaughters. \"It was going to be Dawn's house because I was going to die,\" he said, explaining that they had included extra rooms in the house, so that their children and grandchildren could come keep his wife company after he was gone. \"And now it's me,\" he said. \"I don't think I can do that.\" He is now leaning on the support of their children and 11 grandchildren, but even that seems incongruous to him. \"My job has always been to take care of other people,\" he said. Slain principal remembered as energetic, positive, passionate . Fittingly for two people who had made their careers in education, the couple met at a school, Rogers Park Middle School in Danbury, Connecticut. It's the same school where he was working Friday. He was a good deal older when they met, but she was his superior in the school hierarchy: She was an assistant principal, and he was a seventh-grade math teacher. \"I just fell in love with her,\" he said. But it took a little while for him to persuade her to marry him: \"She turned me down five times.\" Once he won her over, their wedding was influenced by their mutual love of sailing, taking place on a boat at sea near the Connecticut port of Mystic a decade ago. They had both been married previously, and their union brought together three daughters on his side and two on hers. One of her two daughters, Erica, described a devoted mother. \"Every practice, she was there,\" she said. \"All of my sister's cheerleadering stuff, she was there. Every dance competition. She was doing homework on the bleachers, but she was there. And she was my rock.\" Dawn Hochsprung's commitment to her family was closely matched by her dedication to her students, according to friends and family members. \"She was really nice and very fun, but she was also very much a tough lady in the right sort of sense,\" according to Tom Prunty, a friend, whose niece goes to Sandy Hook and was uninjured Friday. \"She was the kind of person you'd want to be educating your kids. And the kids loved her.\" Her decision to step out into danger when the shooting began has left her husband with some difficult emotions. \"Dawn put herself in jeopardy, and I have been angry about that,\" he said. But that changed Sunday, he said, when he met two teachers who told him that his wife had instructed them to take shelter while she confronted Lanza. \"She could've avoided that,\" George Hochsprung said. \"But she didn't; I knew she wouldn't. So, I'm not angry anymore.\" His voice wavering, he continued: \"I'm not angry.

At least 110 bodies have been recovered from the scene, while more than a 150 bags filled with body parts have been transported to hospitals across the region, according to Farkhand Iqbal, a municipal official in Islamabad. World's deadliest plane crashes . The flight data recorder, which is considered a key component in determining what may have caused the tragedy, was recovered, officials said. The Bhoja airliner had been flying from the southern seaport city of Karachi and crashed just before touching down in the capital after its 3\u00c2\u00bd-hour flight. Local authorities say the crash site is located about five aeronautical miles from the airport in Islamabad. Weather reports indicated that conditions in the area included thunderstorms and limited visibility, according to CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos. Authorities are examining what may have caused the crash and the potential for additional casualties at the site of the wreckage. Investigators are \"going to be looking at technology,\" aviation security consultant Greg Feith said. \"What kind of radio equipment, what kind of ground proximity warning system the aircraft was equipped with, weather radar, things like that ... since the weather may be a factor in this accident.\" Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani on Friday expressed \"deep shock and grief over the tragedy,\" ordering his country's Civil Aviation Authority \"to gear up all its resources for rescue operation,\" state media reported. A separate inquiry into the incident has been launched by Pakistan's Safety Investigation Board, and two crisis operation rooms have been set up at airports in both Islamabad and Karachi to provide information to the affected families. A Boeing spokeswoman, meanwhile, said the American manufacturer \"stands ready to provide technical assistance to the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan.\" The airliner was originally sold in 1985, said Julie O'Donnell. \"The Boeing Company wishes to extend its profound condolences to the families and friends of those lost today in the Bhoja Air accident in Pakistan, as well as wishes for the recovery of those injured,\" said O'Donnell. Responding to allegations that the aircraft was not in good condition to fly, Defense Secretary Nargis Sethi told a local television station that the government has initiated \"an immediate investigation.\" \"Whether it was 10, 8 years old, or not airworthy is something that we can't confirm yet,\" Sethi said. But Bhoja Air station manager Zahid Bangish told a Pakistani television station later Friday that the \"aircraft was new, not the old one and unairworthy.\" The crash is reminiscent of one in 2010,when 152 people were killed as a Pakistani passenger plane crashed on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. That plane was also was coming from Karachi when it crashed into a hillside while trying to land, officials said at the time. Four years earlier, another airliner crashed in central Pakistan, leaving 45 dead. The first known commercial passenger airplane crash occurred in Pakistan in 1953 when a Canadian Pacific DH-106 Comet crashed shortly after takeoff from Karachi. That crash killed 11 people on board.

Unless they did, they're not even in contention for the title. Husband and wife, Kip and Nicole Macy, pleaded guilty to felony charges of residential burglary, stalking and attempted grand theft this week, after terrorizing tenants for years, the San Francisco District Attorney's Office said Wednesday. \"The actions of these defendants are so outlandish and brazen that it sounds like the plot line of a horror movie,\" District Attorney George Gascon said. How bad did it get? Kip and Nicole Macy so badly wanted to evict tenants from their apartment building in the South of Market district starting in 2006, court documents say, that they cut holes in the floor of one victim's living room with a power saw while he was inside his apartment. \"He actually saw the saw coming up and trying to saw through,\" Assistant District Attorney Kelly Burke told CNN affiliate KTVU. The Macys also cut out sections of the floor joists. Before making the cuts, Nicole Macy took the time to consult with a city building inspector to make sure she knew which beam to cut to make the building structurally unsound. \"They want to make it collapse,\" Ricardo Cartagena, a former property manager for the Macys, told affiliate KGO. Kip Macy later bought a semiautomatic handgun and threatened to shoot Cartagena after he refused to cut the joists himself. The couple eventually changed the locks to Cartagena's apartment, removed all of his belongings and destroyed them, court records show. Not done yet . Nicole Macy also created a couple of fraudulent e-mails accounts to stir up trouble. In one, pretending to be one of the victims, she fired the attorney who was representing the victim in a civil case against the Macys. From another e-mail account, Macy sent a message to her and her husband's civil attorneys, threatening to kidnap and dismember their children. In the e-mail, she pretended to be one of victims. Still not done . Over the course of two years, the Macys cut the victims' telephone lines and shut off their electricity, gas and water, court documents say. Nicole Macy told workers to board up one victim's windows from the outside while he still lived there and falsely reported trespassers in the victim's apartment, causing him and a friend to be held at gunpoint by a police. They also broke into the units of three tenants, removing nearly all of their belongings. In a separate incident, the Macys soaked their beds, clothes and electronics with ammonia.

Appearing on CBS' \"Late Show with David Letterman\" Thursday, the Republican presidential candidate apologized for skipping out on a scheduled visit in September that Letterman later made the subject of an ongoing joke. \"I screwed up,\" McCain told Letterman more than once in the interview that aired Thursday night. McCain's appearance on the show comes three weeks after he raised the ire of the generally mild-mannered host by canceling at the last minute, citing his decision to suspend his presidential campaign because of the financial crisis. \"This doesn't smell right,\" Letterman said. \"This is not the way a tested hero behaves. Somebody's putting something in his Metamucil.\" Letterman also didn't appear to buy the Arizona senator's explanation for the cancellation. At the time, he showed the audience a live feed of McCain preparing for an interview with CBS anchor Katie Couric. After praising McCain's record as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, he said, \"This is not the John McCain I know, by God.\" Letterman has repeatedly harped on McCain for the missed appearance, noting the Arizona senator's poll numbers appeared to begin to slide right after he skipped out on the show. \"Look at all the conversation I gave you. Including having Mr. Olbermann on,\" McCain told Letterman Thursday night, referencing the MSNBC liberal talk show host who filled in for him that night. However, Thursday's interview was not all fun and games, as Letterman pressed McCain on Republican VP Sarah Palin's preparedness to lead the country through \"the next 9/11 attack..\" \"Absolutely,\" she is, McCain said. \"She has inspired Americans. That's the thing we need.\" McCain said her experience as a mayor, governor and PTA member have prepared her to be president. \"In all due respect, one of the people I admired most was an obscure governor of a southern state called Arkansas and he turned out to be a fairly successful president,\" McCain said. \"I mean, Ronald Reagan was a cowboy, no experience in international affairs. So, look, I think she has shown leadership.\" When Letterman asked McCain about Palin's charge that Barack Obama \"palled around with terrorists,\" the senator said \"he did.\" McCain said that while Obama might have been just a child when William Ayers founded the Weathermen, a Vietnam War era group blamed for several domestic bombings. Ayers recently said he regretted not doing more attacks. \"Mr. Ayers, on 2001, September 11, 2001 said, 'I wish I had bombed more,'\" said McCain. McCain's reference was to a New York Times story published on September 11, 2001, when Ayers wrote \"I don't regret setting bombs ... I feel we didn't do enough.\" Later, after the issue was raised in an April primary debate by Sen. Hillary Clinton, Ayers posted his 2001 reply to the Times story on his blog, saying, \"I said I had a thousand regrets, but no regrets for opposing the war with every ounce of my strength.\"\n### Response:", "target": "\"I screwed up,\" John McCain tells David Letterman for canceling scheduled visit .\nLetterman used McCain's no-show as subject of ongoing joke .\nMcCain also discussed Sarah Palin, Obama's ties to 1960s' radical William Ayers .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Give me a one line summary of the story below:Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Hindu holy man castrated himself in India Wednesday following the arrest of popular preacher Asaram Bapu, revered by millions across the country for his sermons on enlightenment. Police have charged the 72-year old guru with raping a 16-year-old schoolgirl at one of his ashrams, or religious centers, in August. Authorities in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh found Baba Premdas, a 60-year old follower of Bapu, bleeding at his home in Amethi from apparently self-inflicted wounds, city police chief Alankrita Singh told CNN. Premdas was admitted to a local hospital and then taken to a bigger health facility for surgery where his condition \"is stable\", said Singh. Asked whether his act was related to the arrest of Asaram Bapu, Singh added, \"We have heard such things, but all this is unconfirmed.\" \"Some say it was because of Bapu's arrest,\" said Singh to AFP earlier, \"some say it was because he feared ending up in Bapu's situation. No one knows.\" Bapu has denied the sexual assault allegations leveled by the teenage girl and her parents, both devotees of the guru. The elderly preacher has also claimed he is physically incapable of rape but police say medical tests show him to be in good shape. \"The team of doctors is saying he is perfectly, medically, mentally and physically fit,\" said Ajayal Lamba, Deputy Commissioner of Police in Jodhpur. Bapu, also referred to as the \"godman\" in local Indian media, is currently in jail awaiting trial after a court rejected his bail plea earlier this week, public prosecutor Anand Purohit told CNN. The prosecution plans to present a detailed dossier of the charges in the trial soon, he said. This month's unfolding rape case against Bapu is just the latest in a series of sexual assault incidents in India since late 2012 that have gained high-profile attention both for their frequency and ferocity. It was the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in New Delhi last December that galvanized Indian society and the media in particular, to examine the pervasive incidence of rape and other forms of violence against women. The barbarity of the crime ignited a wide-ranging discussion across all levels of the Indian media and prompted multiple debates in the national and regional assemblies. Stung into action by public outrage, the government instituted new laws and crucially stricter punishments, which includes the death penalty when victims are killed or left in a vegetative state. Furthermore in a sharp departure with previous practice, predatory behavior such as voyeurism, stalking and groping can now lead to arrest and punishment. India's court system is now making greater use of fast-track trials to prosecute the most heinous and high-profile crimes against women. Local and national media have maintained their spotlight on sexual assaults and other violence against women, leading to a torrent of disturbing reports following last December's horrific rape incident. In March, at least five men from a local tribe gang-raped a Swiss woman camping with her husband in a forest in India's Datia district. A court convicted six men to life in prison four months later. In April, a 4-year-old Indian girl was raped by a 35-year-old man in India's central Maharashtra state. The girl suffered brain damage and was in a coma for two weeks before dying from cardiac arrest. And in June, at least three men gang-raped a 31-year-old American tourist in northern India after she visited the Vashishth Temple after midnight. She accepted a ride from the group after failing to find a taxi. They drove her to a wooded area where they assaulted her. While such incidents have been covered extensively by international news media, an even larger number of cases are only reported in domestic Indian news outlets -- and an unknown number simply go unreported. Just this week in local media, the Times of India reported two men gang-raped a 27-year-old woman who had gone to a local dairy in northern Uttar Pradesh state, the Hindustan Times reported at least six to seven girls were lured to and raped at a deserted steel mill south of Mumbai over the past half year, and the Indian Express reported the story of a 14-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by two people over several months in western Gujarat state. Villagers discovered the girl was pregnant but later miscarried twin babies. According to India's National Crime Records Bureau, the country recorded 24,923 cases of reported rape in 2012 -- a 57% rise in reported cases since 2003. This number is widely considered to be extremely underreported for a country of more than 1 billion people. The United States, with a population of more than 310 million, recorded 270,000 cases of rape in 2010, the most recent year for which national rape statistics are available.

Bill Nelson, D-Fla., also asked for a report on the service after a Florida veteran told the Tampa television station WFTS he was put on hold repeatedly for up to 10 minutes at a time, while he was suicidal. \n  \n John Daigh, VA assistant inspector general for health care inspections, said his office could not substantiate that veterans were placed on hold because neither the Veterans Crisis Line staff nor the backup center managers monitor information on how long calls stayed in backup center queues. \n  \n But Daigh did find that some veterans who reached a backup center were transferred to a voicemail system. And according to the VA OIG, staff members at that backup center were unaware they had a voicemail system, and the calls weren't returned. \n  \n The VA OIG staff made a number of recommendations to ensure that veterans receive better service from the Veterans Crisis Line. They include: \n  \n Resolving all problems related to calls routed to the backup centers. \n  \n Improved tracking of calls at the backup centers. \n  \n Establishing a quality assurance process for both the Veterans Crisis Line and the backup centers. \n  \n Ensuring that contracts with the backup centers set expectations. \n  \n VA officials said they agreed with the recommendations and would implement all changes no later than Sept. 30. \n  \n A VA spokeswoman also said a number of changes already were underway at the Veterans Crisis Line, to include that callers are never placed on hold while waiting for services or to be assessed for risk. \n  \n The department also has hired additional staff to work peak hours and is upgrading its telephone and technology systems and renovating space to ensure it can accommodate larger peak-time staff. \n  \n \u201cThese improvements are already beginning to show that we are increasing our capacity to speak with the veterans who need us,\u201d VA Secretary Robert McDonald said during a visit to the New York facility in September. \n  \n The Veterans Crisis Hotline is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at 800-273-8255, press 1.

The unrest comes after a string of self-immolations by Tibetan protesters in recent months and with the approach of the anniversary of an uprising against Chinese rule, which has been a flash point in the past. The United States, which recognizes Tibet as an autonomous region of China, expressed concern about the situation. \"We are seriously concerned by reports of violence continuing, heightened tensions in the Tibetan area of China, including reports that security forces in Sichuan Province have been opening fire on protesters, killing some and injuring others,\" Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said Tuesday. The Chinese government and international groups advocating Tibetan rights have offered differing versions of events this week in Ganzi, which Tibetans call Kardze. China has accused the rights groups of trying to \"distort the truth\" about the violence through \"ill-intentioned hype.\" The first clashes took place Monday in Luhuo County, known as Drango by Tibetans. Citing witnesses, rights groups like Free Tibet and the International Campaign for Tibet say that thousands of Tibetans had marched on government offices before the police opened fire into the unarmed crowd, killing two or three protesters and injuring dozens. The reports, which could not be independently verified, contrasted with the account given by the Chinese state news agency. A group of people, some with knives, damaged stores along a main street before throwing stones at the police and destroying two police vehicles and two ambulances, according to Xinhua news agency. The violence left one of the marchers dead and four wounded, as well as five police officers wounded, according to the news agency. It did not mention the use of guns by the authorities. Then on Tuesday, violence reportedly erupted in Seda County, which Tibetans call Serthar. Tibetan advocacy groups said that the Chinese security forces had shot dead between two and five protesters. There was no immediate reaction from the Chinese authorities on the reports of violence in Seda. \"How long and how many tragic deaths are necessary before the world takes a firm moral stand?\" said Sangay, who took over from the Dalai Lama last year as the political head of the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India. \"Silence from the world community sends a clear message to China that its repressive and violent measures to handle tensions in Tibetan areas are acceptable.\" The United States said it was keeping the pressure on China over the issue. The violence comes ahead of the Tibetan New Year on February 22 amid high tensions following more than a dozen self-immolations by Tibetans in the past year. For a fifth straight year, China will close Tibet to foreign tourists again this year from the Tibetan New Year festival until the anniversary of a deadly anti-government riot among Tibetans in March, according to regional travel agents.

Even conservative kingpin Rush Limbaugh has something in common with the thousands of protesters flooding American streets with anger over the grand jury decision in the Eric Garner case. They all think the grand jury got it wrong. It was enough for the satirists at NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" to poke a little fun at civil rights icon Al Sharpton, who has found his world suddenly turned topsy-turvy will all the new allies in the Garner case. \"What the hell is going on?\" an actor portraying Sharpton said on Saturday's program. \"Last night I was sitting in front of my TV, and I found myself saying, 'You damn right, Bill O'Reilly.' I'm all messed up!\" And it's not just O'Reilly. In contrast with another high-profile case involving brutality complaints against police -- the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri -- a solid majority of Americans disagree with the New York grand jury that declined to charge Officer Daniel Pantaleo in Garner's death, according to a Bloomberg Politics poll released Sunday. 'Week of Outrage' gets underway . According to the poll, 60% of Americans feel the grand jury made the wrong decision. Twenty-five percent of respondents said they agreed with the decision. The backlash -- both from conservative commentators and the public -- is different from the reaction to the recent grand jury decision to forgo charges against the white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, a much more widely reported incident. In that case, a majority of Americans agreed with the grand jury, although opinions were split firmly along racial, and often political lines. According to the Bloomberg poll, 52% of Americans -- including 64% of whites -- sided with the grand jury's findings. Thirty-six percent disagreed, including 78% of African-American respondents to the poll, which was conducted December 3 to December 5 and has a margin of error of three percentage points. A CNN/ORC poll found similar divisions in the Ferguson case. In that poll -- conducted before the grand jury decision was announced -- 54% of non-whites said Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson should be charged with murder. Among whites, 23% shared the same feeling. Washington Post writer Aaron Blake said the poll results in the Garner case show it is \"the turning point Ferguson never was.\" \"In the Garner case, there is a video, leading to less debate about the particulars of precisely what happened,\" Blake wrote in a piece published Monday. \"As this poll shows, that is much more conducive to building consensus. And when it comes to taking action in response -- action of any kind -- that kind of bipartisan and biracial consensus makes it significantly more likely,\" he wrote. Not so fast, said Jason Johnson, a political science professor at Hiram College in Hiram, Ohio. \"Acknowledging something is wrong is not the same as doing something about it,\" he said. He said conservative pundits who have \"cherry picked\" the Garner case aren't likely to stand arm-in-arm with protesters demanding reforms. But what of the poll results showing more Americans take issue with the Garner decision? That's where Johnson sees change coming, but not with Garner's death as the catalyst. Political and demographic changes have been driving those changes for years, Johnson said, ever since the Rodney King case roiled Los Angeles and the nation after police officers were taped beating King as he rolled in agony on a Los Angeles street following a high-speed chase. Trust in police has fallen in recent years, he said, citing poll results that particularly show a decline in trust among African-Americans. Meanwhile, the country has become more diverse. Those changes will eventually force a change in how police do their work, Johnson said. What the Garner case could do, he said, is move the national conversation past what some consider to be the overly simplistic suggestion that police body cameras will solve everything. \"The changes we're going to see now, if there are any, are going to have to be much more substantive and much more on the ground,\" he said.\n### Response: ", "target": "Polling, pundit reactions, suggest outrage over Eric Garner case is widespread .\nConservative icons join protesters in criticizing grand jury decision .\nBut political science professor says he doesn't think that means the case is a watershed .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

People seeking refuge sit on a curb and sidewalk outside the U.S. Embassy in Harare on Thursday. By evening, embassy officials were moving \"most of the women and children into safe houses,\" and were trying to get water and blankets for the growing crowd, Weinberg said. Some of the refuge-seekers, identifying themselves as supporters of the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change, said militia members supporting President Robert Mugabe's party destroyed their homes or were hunting them because of their affiliation, according to a journalist at the scene. CNN is not identifying the reporter for security reasons. The journalist said the refuge-seekers, some holding their possessions, sat outside the building Thursday afternoon, waiting to be addressed by a U.S. Embassy official. A few of the people had bandaged wounds, according to the reporter. \"The people I can see right now look very miserable, dejected, confused,\" the reporter said.  Watch the refuge-seekers wait outside the embassy \u00bb . The MDC has said its members were targeted by supporters of Mugabe during the weeks surrounding March's presidential election and last week's runoff. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai withdrew from the June 27 runoff, citing violence, intimidation and allegations of vote-rigging. That left Mugabe as the only runoff candidate, allowing him to claim re-election. Tsvangirai himself fled to South Africa for a short time in March during the campaign season, saying he feared for his safety. He also sought refuge in the Dutch Embassy in Harare on June 22, shortly after announcing he was withdrawing from the runoff. He returned to his Harare home this week, a Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman said. Several Western nations denounced the violence and declared Mugabe's runoff victory illegitimate. Reports of violence have continued after the runoff. On Monday, the MDC claimed that a politician from the party was abducted at gunpoint outside a courthouse in the city of Mutare. The assailants, who the MDC said wore military outfits, took Naison Nemadziva, a lawmaker who recently won a seat in parliament against a member of Mugabe's party, the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front. The MDC claimed in a press release that the kidnapping was by supporters of ZANU-PF and that police had not been able to find the lawmaker. This week, a resolution from the African Union in Egypt called for negotiations between Tsvangirai and Mugabe, and some European Union officials have called for a coalition government in Zimbabwe with Tsvangirai as its leader. But Tsvangirai this week said the \"conditions prevailing in Zimbabwe ... are not conducive\" to negotiations with Mugabe. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Wednesday said Mugabe \"has blood on his hands\" after the violence leading to the runoff and should step down. Mugabe has been Zimbabwe's only leader since its independence from Britain in 1980, when it was called Rhodesia.\n### Response: ", "target": "Embassy spokesman: Officials exploring housing options for refuge-seekers .\nU.S. Embassy in Harare: 220 Zimbabweans seeking refuge from violence .\nPeople in crowd say they've been driven from homes by supporters of ruling party .\nCountry in political crisis since disputed vote in March, presidential runoff last month .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction: How would you encapsulate this?\n### Input :Iran is jamming satellite broadcasts in attempts to stop people seeing a new film telling the story of Neda Agha-Soltan, the young woman who was shot dead during the mass protests that followed last summer's disputed presidential election. \n  \n Viewers in Tehran complained of jamming and power cuts on Wednesday and yesterday when the Voice of America Persian TV network broadcast the documentary For Neda, featuring the first film interviews with the family of the 27-year-old. \n  \n The 70-minute film, made by Mentorn Media for HBO and being screened in the US this month, has rapidly gone viral in Iran in the run-up to next Saturday's anniversary of the disputed elections that triggered the protests. It is available on YouTube so can be seen by anyone with access to the internet. \n  \n Street protests began shortly after the polls closed on 12 June last year, when the incumbent hardliner, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, claimed victory over the Green movement leader, Mir Hossein Mousavi, triggering claims that the vote had been rigged. \n  \n Neda became an instant symbol of Iran's struggle for democracy. On 20 June, within hours of her killing \u2013 described as \"probably the most widely witnessed death in human history\" \u2013 mobile phone images of her bloodstained face were being held up by demonstrators in Tehran and all over the world. \n  \n The film was directed by Antony Thomas and co-produced by Saeed Kamali Dehghan, a former Guardian correspondent in Iran. Kamali Dehghan risked arrest to interview Neda's parents and siblings and obtain unseen footage of her life. \n  \n Witnesses have said that she was shot in the heart by a sniper with the Basij militia force, who has been named as Abbas Kargar-Javid. \n  \n Iran's intelligence ministry is reportedly due to release its own documentary to remove \"ambiguities\" surrounding her death and provide \"new evidence\" about what it calls the west's version of events. \n  \n Neda's family were under pressure to cooperate with the official documentary but refused. Two of her friends were forced to participate. \n  \n It is not clear whether the official film is the same as one produced earlier this year by Iranian state TV. That suggested that Neda was an agent of the US and Britain who staged her own death and poured blood on her face. BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne was also blamed for her killing before being expelled. \n  \n HBO says it took the unprecedented decision to pre-release the film for Iranian audiences because of its relevance in the run-up to the anniversary of the polls. \n  \n Ahmadinejad today warned the opposition of tough measures, ahead of protests next week. \"Those who want to tarnish the image of the country and its system will be removed from the [political] scene,\" he said in a speech marking the 21st anniversary of the death of Ayatollah Khomeini, architect of the 1979 Islamic revolution, which toppled the shah. \n  \n \"The election last year was the most democratic in the world as nowhere else would 40 million people turn up for elections,\" he claimed. Ahmadinejad pledged: \"Whoever stands against the Islamic system will not survive.\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor as supreme leader, boasted that Iran, facing new UN sanctions over its nuclear programme, was in a position to \"see off any conspiracies\". \n  \n Mehdi Karroubi, a defeated reformist candidate, was attacked and heckled by hardliners when he visited the shrine yesterday. \"Whoever objects to fraud in the election is accused of being a Mossad or CIA agent,\" he said. \"The fate of the election is in the hands of the Basijis and revolutionary guards.\" Karroubi warned on his website that the Islamic regime was being ruined. \"They speak as if Imam [Khomeini] belongs to them only and others have broken path with the imam.\" ||||| Uploaded on \n  \n FOR NEDA reveals the true story of Neda Agha-Soltan, who became another tragic casualty of Iran's violent crackdown on post-election protests on June 20, 2009. Unlike many unknown victims, however, she instantly became an international symbol of the struggle: Within hours of Agha-Soltan's death, cell phone photographs of her blood-stained face were held aloft by crowds protesting in Tehran and across the world.

The first crack in the cold cases came when police in the tiny town of Sayre were testing sonar equipment in September 2013 in murky Foss Lake. They were stunned to discover a green 1952 Chevrolet and a blue 1969 Chevrolet Camaro. Human remains found in the Camaro matched the general descriptions of three teenagers -- Jimmy Allen Williams, 16, Leah Gail Johnson, 18, and Thomas Michael Rios, 18, all from Sayre, the state Medical Examiner's Office said. Oklahoma lake bodies: Diver, trooper recount discovery . The other remains matched the genders and ages of three passengers in the green Chevrolet who went missing in 1969, the medical examiner said last year. John Alva Porter, then 69, was in that car with Cleburn Hammack, 42, and Nora Marie Duncan, 58. DNA test results this week prove that the bodies belonged to the missing, the state Medical Examiner's Office said, adding that they all died from drowning and their deaths were accidental. One night in 1970, another in 1969 . The three teenagers who disappeared went for a ride around their hometown in Williams' blue Camaro with a white top, according to the Doe Network, a volunteer organization that helps law enforcement solve cold cases. Only six days before the 16-year-old and his friends went missing, Williams had bought the used Camaro, a slick muscle car that teenage boys loved at that time, said Dayva Spitzer, publisher of The Sayre Record & Beckham County Democrat newspaper. Johnson was Native American and, Spitzer said, was related to legendary Indian chief Sitting Bull. Residents regarded Johnson as an Indian princess, she told CNN. Williams and his friends had planned to attend a football game the night they went missing, but they may have gone hunting instead, Spitzer said.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?\n### Input:(CNN) -- Liangqiao, a small collection of huts and farms in southern China, is known as a cancer village. Zhu Chun Yun lost her husband to cancer and now worries for her daughter's health. It is where Hu Xiaoping, a husband and father and a farmer, died an agonizing death at age 30 one year after being diagnosed with colon cancer. His widow, Zhu Chun Yun, blames his death on the brown and rust-colored water from the river, which farmers use to irrigate their crops. \"The doctor in the hospital told us not to live here,\" she told CNN through an interpreter. \"He said don't eat the rice and don't drink the water.\" Residents of Liangqiao say their river is polluted because of the iron-ore mine about 35 miles away, which is run by a nationally owned company. Mining for iron-ore exposes naturally occurring heavy metals like arsenic and cadmium, which are both carcinogens. Without proper water treatment facilities, water contaminated with high levels of these metals is hazardous and can possibly cause cancer. Jingjing Zhang, an environmental lawyer who is working the villagers who want to sue the government, said the Dabaoshan mine has been polluting the Hengshui River for decades. \"I always had a dream to live in a place where there's a clean river I can swim in, but this dream seems very difficult to achieve in China now,\" she said. Twenty-eight people in this village of 400 have died over the last 10 years from cancer -- a rate much higher than the rest of country. The overall mortality rate for 2006 was 137 deaths per 100,000 residents. Pollution is a serious problem throughout China. The Chinese ministry of health reported that increased pollution has made cancer the leading cause of death in the country. China, along with the United States, is a leading emitter of greenhouse gases, which experts say can contribute to global warming. In terms of total emissions, China is projected by the International Energy Association to become the world's leading greenhouse gas producing country this year. It can also impact the U.S. food supply. The amount of food imported from China has grown dramatically in the past decade. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States imported $4.1 billion worth of seafood and agricultural products from China in 2006. In 1995, it was $800 million. In June, the United States banned five types of fish and shrimp from China because inspectors found traces of cancer-causing chemicals and antibiotics in the products. Small villages like Liangqiao have little recourse against big companies that might be polluting their air or water. CNN talked to the mine's director who acknowledged environmental issues with the mine, but said it wasn't a problem that could be solved overnight. He said some of the smaller, privately owned mines should share blame for the problems. The mine has given the villagers some compensation. About 1,700 Yuan ($200) for the whole village, Zhang told CNN. Zhang continues to build her case against the mine, trying to win compensation for medical testing, health care and damage to the village's rice crops. She hopes to go to trial next year. Water tests from Huanan Agricultural University have concluded the Hengshui is indeed too toxic for any human use, in stark contrast to what Jingjing said the government told the villagers. They told her \"we already meet all environmental standards,\" she said. China is trying to address its pollution problem. In September, the Chinese State Environmental Protection Administration shut down 400 companies for water-pollution violations and suspended 249 other businesses, according to China Daily. And last week China announced a joint campaign with the European Union to clean up China's two largest river basins. The government hopes to have a dramatically cleaner country by August, when it will be host to the Olympics. It is too late for Zhu's husband. She said that after he got cancer he was unable to work and he reluctantly went for medical treatment. \"He didn't want to go to the hospital because he worried we didn't have enough money to bring up our daughter,\" she said. Zhu told CNN she doesn't have time to be sad. All she worries about is caring for daughter and her small plot of land.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The community organizing group ACORN on Wednesday announced a hiring freeze, new training programs and an independent review of its programs after the recent release of a series of videotapes embarrassing to the agency. In the videos, the individuals seek advice on setting up a brothel with underage women from El Salvador. The videos, secretly taped by two individuals posing as a pimp and a prostitute, showed ACORN employees in four of the agency's offices suggesting or condoning a series of illicit actions as the couple sought advice on setting up a brothel with underage women from El Salvador. \"We have all been deeply disturbed by what we've seen in some of these videos,\" ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis said. \"I must say on behalf of ACORN's board and our Advisory Council that we will go to whatever lengths necessary to re-establish the public trust.\" The steps announced include an immediate halt in hiring for all ACORN offices, an immediate training program for all front-line staff and selection of an independent auditor by the end of this week.  Watch Lewis address the scandal \u00bb . As the announcement was made, FBI Director Robert Mueller appeared on Capitol Hill for a wide-ranging oversight hearing, and when asked about ACORN, he signaled a potential federal investigation of the organization. In response to a description of the highly publicized videotapes by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Mueller said he had just learned of the matter. \"I think the first time I heard of this incident to which you refer was last evening,\" Mueller said. \"Clearly, given what you have said, it's something in consultation with the Department of Justice that we would look at.\" At least 11 states have been investigating ACORN -- the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- for alleged voter registration fraud stemming from the general election in 2008. The statement issued by ACORN on Wednesday stands in sharp contrast to comments earlier in the week, in which a  spokesman called the recordings' release \"an orchestrated sham.\" Spokesman Scott Levenson said the taping was an attempt to \"create news rather than report the news.\" The videos by filmmaker James O'Keefe and his colleague Hannah Giles have caused ACORN to fire four employees shown on the tapes.  Watch some of the recordings \u00bb . The videos were shot in ACORN offices in New York; Baltimore, Maryland; Washington; and San Bernardino, California. ACORN claims that the film team also attempted to \"trick\" employees in several other cities to make incriminating statements but failed. Fallout from the publicity prompted the U.S. Senate this week to vote 83-7 to block Housing and Urban Development grants to ACORN. Lewis responded with a statement saying that although the organization was \"disappointed that the Senate took the rare and politically convenient step\" of cutting HUD grants, the move would have little effect. \"Fortunately, ACORN derives most of its income from its members and other supporters, so the decision will have little impact on overall operations,\" Lewis said. On its Web site, ACORN, which was founded in 1970, describes itself as \"the nation's largest community organization of low- and moderate-income families, working together for social justice and stronger communities.\"\n### Response: ", "target": "People disguised as pimp, prostitute secretly filmed group's employees .\n\"We have all been deeply disturbed\" by videos, CEO says .\nSteps include hiring freeze, independent review of programs .\nFBI director hints at Justice Department investigation .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?New York (CNN) -- The first time I held a premature baby was nearly two decades ago during medical school. The baby weighed just 3 pounds, and I remember being so afraid I might drop her. While I stared into her eyes, it gave me goose bumps. The parents hadn't yet given her a name because they worried she wouldn't survive. The neonatal ICU (NICU) nurses were truly remarkable, taking care of these preemies, and making it all seem so effortless. I do remember the most anxiety-provoking times surrounded the transport of these babies. Even if it was just one floor away, there was a plan laid out with clear communication and a defined role for the half a dozen NICU nurses who would accompany the baby. There was a commander of the transport, and several contingencies for worst-case scenarios. I remember asking one of the nurses, \"What is the safest way to transport this baby?\" Her reply: \"In the womb.\" She was right, and if you consider the number of risks to a premature baby, you understand why. The heart rate of tiny babies can suddenly drop, and they can even develop a complete heart block. They require oxygen, but not too much because they are at risk of oxygen toxicity to their lungs. They can barely regulate their temperature, and they have a larger body surface area to mass ratio, which makes the problem even worse. They can lose fluids rapidly, and they don't yet have glycogen stores in their liver. So, not getting a timely meal could prove fatal. Imagine any of these things happening outside of the ICU, and now compound that by 100. That is what took place Monday night at NYU's Langone Medical Center. As you watch the video of these babies being rushed through the streets of New York, you now have a better idea of just how involved all of this really was. At about 10:30 p.m. Monday, with generators failing and widespread internal flooding, hospital staff called the CEO of Mount Sinai, Dr. Kenneth Davis, and asked for help. He immediately approved the transfer of 64 patients, including three mothers in labor and seven newborn babies. One of them was Emma, just 13 days old and weighing only 2 pounds. Emma's parents were in New Jersey, watching in horror as they learned the hospital was being evacuated. Shortly thereafter, they lost power and had no way of driving back into the city of Manhattan. As a parent myself, that part of their story really got to me the most. They were completely in the dark, stranded and helpless. I met Emma just a few hours after she arrived at Mount Sinai. She was in the NICU, and was perfectly stable. There were lots of tears of joy in the hospital, as families were reunited for the first time. Resilient, was how one of the nurses described little Emma. Still gives me goose bumps.\n### Response: ", "target": "Transporting premature babies can be anxiety-provoking, Gupta says .\nTheir medical needs make them especially fragile .\nEmma was among patients evacuated from NYU Langone Medical Center .\nGupta says meeting Emma, who is stable, gave him goose bumps .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The pressure that was put on him to be a combination 'super human' political figure and 'fixer' got the better of him,\" his agent, Darren Prince, said Sunday in a written statement. \"He is embarrassed, saddened and remorseful for the anger and hurt his words have caused.\" Prince said Rodman is at a facility in New Jersey, one with a \"28- or 30-day\" program. He said Rodman drank heavily in North Korea during a recent tumultuous trip to the secretive state to play a basketball game with some former NBA stars against national team players from the regime. \"His drinking escalated to a level that none of us had seen before,\" Prince said Saturday. Rodman teammate Charles Smith: North Korea didn't pay us . Rodman entered a center on Wednesday, a source close to him told CNN. Rodman -- the colorful basketball Hall of Famer who won five NBA titles while the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls  --  said alcohol was one reason he shot from the lip earlier this month and told CNN that an American imprisoned in North Korea since 2012 may have done something to deserve his sentence of 15 years' hard labor. After Kenneth Bae's family complained, Rodman apologized, saying he was under stress and had been drinking when he was interviewed on CNN's \"New Day.\" Some commentators have said Rodman's \"basketball diplomacy\" may have positive effects in North Korea by offering the people there a different view of the West, compared with its demonic portrayal in the country's tightly controlled state media. But others, including human rights activists, say it's an embarrassing media sideshow that distracts attention from the North Korean regime's brutality. A State Department official said Rodman's visit was \"marginally unhelpful\" and Sen. John McCain said of the retired athlete, \"I think he's an idiot.\" Rodman, 52, led a team of former NBA players in a game in North Korea, which he called a birthday present to dictator Kim Jong Un, and, in a bizarre moment, sang \"Happy Birthday\" inside a packed sports stadium. Upon leaving North Korea, Rodman was immediately criticized for his friendship with Kim. A mass of reporters met him at the Bejing airport and Rodman broke into tears while answering questions. \"I'm not the president,\" he told the reporters. \"I'm not an ambassador. I'm Dennis Rodman.\" Rodman also said, \"I'm sorry for what's going on in North Korea, the certain situations,\" but he didn't apologize for his visit.

Rodman visited during a time of high tension between the two nations. North Korea has pursued a nuclear program, much to the United States' distress.

The news comes days after a federal prosecutor said user data on the site, which is accused of knowingly hosting illegally pirated material, could be deleted as early as this week. Megaupload's attorney now says the companies that own the servers where the files are stored have agreed to wait while a solution is pursued. \"Carpathia and Cogent agreed to preserve consumer data for additional time of at least two weeks so #Megaupload can work with US on proposal,\" attorney Ira Rothken said late Monday on Twitter. One of those companies, Carpathia Hosting, said Tuesday that it's working with Internet-rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation to help users get their data back. \"Although Carpathia does not have, and has never had, access to the content on Megaupload's servers, the hosting provider wants to assist lawful users of the Megaupload service by promoting EFF and its nonprofit legal services,\" the company said in a statement.

Federal prosecutors on Friday had said files, presumably including perfectly legal ones, may be deleted, starting as soon as Thursday. \"It is our understanding that the hosting companies may begin deleting the contents of the servers beginning as early as February 2, 2012,\" U.S. Attorney Neil H. MacBride said in a letter filed in federal court. The letter, submitted Friday in the Eastern District of Virginia, says that government investigators had finished executing search warrants at centers where Megaupload and MegaVideo files are stored. MacBride wrote that the government copied some data but didn't remove any. Now that the search has been finished, the government no longer has access to the servers, he said. Seven people associated with the popular site were indicted this month on charges that they knowingly operated an \"international organized criminal enterprise\" allowing worldwide sharing of illegally pirated movies, music and other media. Attorneys for Megaupload, which is based in Hong Kong, have denied the charges. The indictment alleges the company has denied copyright holders an estimated $500 million and that those indicted have earned roughly $175 million in the process. Lost in the shuffle, though, may be millions of legitimate files stored on the site by its users. According to the government's indictment, Megaupload has claimed more than 180 million registered users in its five-year existence. While some of those users say they went to the site to look for movies, television shows and other material that may be copyrighted, numerous others have complained that they've lost access to personal and professional materials stored there. In the Carpathia statement, an attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation said the group is \"troubled\" that lawful users have \"had their property taken from them without warning and that the government has taken no steps to help them.\" \"We think it's important that these users have their voices heard as this process moves forward,\" said Julie Samuels, a staff attorney at the foundation.\n### Response:", "target": "Companies have two weeks to save Megaupload files, lawyer says .\nAnnouncement comes after feds said files might be deleted this week .\nThe file-sharing and storage site is accused of allowing piracy .\nServer companies are working to help users get Megaupload files, lawyer says .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?Hong Kong (CNN) -- China's move to abolish re-education through labor camps -- under which tens of thousands have been imprisoned without trial -- may be no more than a cosmetic change, a new report from Amnesty International warns. The human rights group says that while labor camps are being shut, research suggested that authorities are expanding the use of \"black jails,\" enforced drug rehabilitation clinics and \"brainwashing centers\" to take their place. \"There is a very real risk that the Chinese authorities will abolish one system of arbitrary detention only to expand the use of other types,\" the report said. A spokesman from China's Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the Amnesty report. Corinna-Barbara Francis, Amnesty International's China researcher, said the abolishment may only be a \"cosmetic change just to avert the public outcry over the abusive re-education through labor system.\" China said on November 15 that it would close its labor camps after earlier putting the policy under review, with the move hailed as the biggest change to China's criminal justice system in decades. Detention without trial . The system was set up in 1950s and allows police to detain petty offenders -- such as thieves, prostitutes and drug addicts -- for up to four years without a trial. According to China's Ministry of Justice, the country had 351 labor camps at the end of 2012, with more than 50,000 inmates. Other estimates have put the number of detainees much higher. The \"re-education process\" has also been used to punish those detained for their political, religious or personal beliefs -- such as members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement or petitioners with complaints against local officials, Amnesty said. Torture is said to be rife at the camps. Detainees have told Amnesty International they were beaten, sometimes with electric batons, denied food, subjected to simulated drowning, injected with unknown drugs and subjected to the \"rack\" torture.\" Brainwashing centers . The report said interviews with petitioners and Falun Gong practitioners revealed abuses were continuing despite the closure of the camps. Some labor camps were being re-labeled as drug rehabilitation centers and released detainees were being sent to black jails -- unofficial detention centers set up in places like hotels or abandoned buildings -- or \"brainwashing centers,\" another form of arbitrary detention. Falun Gong practitioner Zhang Zhi told Amnesty International she was released from a labor camp in Harbin in June 2013 but on her release staff from a brainwashing center were waiting for her at the gate. Her family were able to intervene and prevented her from being taken away. She has since gone into hiding. \"The Chinese authorities must immediately end all forms of arbitrary detention and ensure that laws protecting detainees are brought into line with international human rights standards,\" Francis said. \"This needs to be a fundamental change in the policies that are at the root of the repression and which strip detainees of their most basic rights.\"\n### Response: ", "target": "Amnesty says China's move to abolish labor camps may be a cosmetic change .\nRights groups says Chinese authorities are expanding use of other types of arbitrary detention .\nChina said on November 15 that it would close its labor camp system .\nNEW: Chinese government declines to comment on the report .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

On October 19, some of the world's most talented musicians were invited to perform a concert in Jerusalem to promote peace. Read more about the World Orchestra for Peace . Months earlier, Panufnik had been asked to compose an original piece for the program. She said her busy schedule didn't allow time to construct a piece from scratch, so she sent the organizers a recording of a violin concerto she had composed in 2004 called \"Abraham.\" The concerto merged elements of Christian, Jewish and Islamic music into a \"homogenous, harmonious and joyful conclusion,\" she said. It seemed perfect for the occasion. \"They loved it,\" she told CNN. \"They asked me to make an orchestral prelude out of it which included making it two-thirds of the length and also assimilating the solo violin part into the rest of the orchestra.\" The resulting piece is a musical representation of the biblical story of Genesis 22, which tells of Abraham being given a last-minute reprieve after being asked by God to sacrifice his only son.  See a clip of \"Three Paths to Peace,\" as performed by the World Orchestra for Peace \u00bb . \"Abraham is considered the father of all these three faiths,\" Panufnik explains. \"The whole concept behind it is that despite all the conflict in the world between the three monotheistic faiths: Christianity, Judaism and Islam -- we do all believe in the same one God.\" Catholic plainsong is interwoven with Anglican Church bell patterns; Judaism is represented by an Ashkenazi Jewish chant and Shofar horn; while Islam is conveyed through Sufi drum patterns and the musical elements from a traditional call to prayer. The original piece required detailed research so as not to risk offense. Muslim clerics in the United Kingdom advised her to listen to many calls to prayer as inspiration for her own, she said. \"I listened to some from Pakistan and Turkey and then took some of the musical elements like the ornamentation and the rhythms.\" The audience seated in the Jerusalem Theater for the piece's world premiere seemed to appreciate her efforts. \"I sort of go on nervous autopilot at these things,\" Panufnik said. \"But they did that rhythmic clapping thing, you know, when everyone starts clapping at the same time, which I'm told is a big sign of appreciation.\" She hopes the \"Three Paths to Peace\" is performed again, but right now she's still buzzing from its debut. \"I came home on Monday night and I woke up on Tuesday morning and thought, 'did I dream this?'

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?\n### Input:Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spain's capital may not be causing shivers to Monaco's famed Monte Carlo casino just yet, but Madrid hopes to muscle in on Europe's appetite for gambling. The first phase of a controversial, multi-billion dollar casino and hotel complex that Spaniards are calling \"EuroVegas\" is scheduled to open in 2017 in the Madrid suburb of Alcorcon, about eight miles southwest of the city center. A top executive from Las Vegas Sands Corporation -- founded and run by American billionaire political activist Sheldon Adelson -- unveiled the exact location of its large complex during a news conference on Friday. The new resort could bring tens of thousands of new jobs to recession-gripped Spain as it lures travelers hungry for a taste of Vegas in Europe. Opponents say the Vegas-style resort would create only low-skilled and low-paying jobs -- not the development model needed to put Spain get back on its feet economically. They also have concerns that the resort would attract organized crime. At Friday's packed news conference, Las Vegas Sands chief operating officer Michael Leven said he's confident of securing financing for the first phase of the project, which would cost approximately $9 billion and include 12,000 hotel rooms. Las Vegas Sands is financing $3.6 billion, or 40%, of the cost of the first phase, and Leven said he has \"assurances from many banks\" about financing the remaining 60%. But an aide later said that no contracts have been signed yet. That may be because Las Vegas Sands must still formally compete to win the right to build the development through an open public bid process. That process opens in March, officials said, and results should be announced by September. If the company wins the bid, groundbreaking could begin by the end of this year. Leven said the first phase could easily generate some tens of thousands of jobs, based on the company's experience at its similar, but smaller, gambling resort in Singapore. A company spokeswoman later said the entire $22 billion project, when completed over 20 years, could create 250,000 jobs. Las Vegas Sands' CEO Adelson has built the company into a leading global developer of gambling, entertainment and convention resorts. It owns The Venetian and The Palazzo gambling resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada, and has expanded into Asian markets, including resorts in Singapore and Macau. Last September, Adelson announced that he'd chosen Madrid, instead of Barcelona, as the site for the project in Spain. That set off months of debate over which of three potential locations in the Madrid area would get the nod, something that was finally resolved publicly on Friday. Las Vegas Sands had previously said that the resort's access to Madrid's international airport was a priority. Yet, the suburb of Alcorcon and the airport are located on opposite sides of city center. Spanish authorities are considering rail links between the airport and the resort, Madrid regional government president Ignacio Gonzalez said Friday, although such a plan would require input from Spain's national government. Another detail being worked out is whether visitors to Madrid's \"EuroVegas\" resort will be able to light up, something that's commonplace inside the large casinos on the Vegas Strip. Spain has strict no-smoking laws in public places and the national government would have to grant a special waiver to allow smoking in the casino resort.\n### Response :", "target": "Company announces exact Madrid location for upcoming Vegas-style casino resort .\nGroundbreaking is scheduled for the end of the year .\nThere are plans to create a rail link between Madrid's airport and the resort .\nIt's unclear if Spain will allow smoking inside the casinos .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What's the main idea?\n### Input:Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- It was not a quiet weekend for the prime minister of Japan, facing a diplomatic test abroad from China and questions at home about his leadership. Sitting down with CNN -- his first interview with an international television network -- Prime Minister Naoto Kan answered wide-ranging questions from pressing economic issues leading up to the upcoming APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit, to the diplomatic challenges from economic superpower China. Kan is a leader looking for a path out of a maze of domestic and international hurdles. He faces the monetary monster that is the sharply rising yen, that's prompting corporations like Toyota and Nissan to push production and jobs outside of Japan. Diplomatically, he is in the middle of a major test with China, a country wielding growing strength in the world economy, and a superpower that's just surpassed Japan in economic might. Japan is in an ongoing dispute with China over islands in the east China Sea. The islands, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, are claimed as territories by both countries. \"As far as Japan is concerned,\" said Kan, \"there is no territorial issue connected to the Senkaku islands. In fact, the Senkaku islands are the inherent territory of Japan. That is recognized in our history and also by international law.\" On September 7, the Japanese coast guard encountered a Chinese fishing crew in the islands' waters. The Chinese fishing vessel collided with two of the coast guard ships. Japan arrested the Chinese crew, quickly releasing the fishermen, but detaining the captain. His detention drew diplomatic fire from China, resulting in the cancellation of high-level ministerial meetings, most recently the abrupt cancellation of a scheduled meeting between Kan and Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Japan eventually released the captain, but relations continue to be strained. At the time of the September 7 incident, the Japanese coast guard captured both collisions on video. The video, deemed highly sensitive by the prime minister's office as it sought a smooth diplomatic out with China, was not released to the public, but shown to a select group of parliamentary lawmakers. Last Friday, the video appeared on YouTube and quickly went viral, sending Prime Minister Kan's office on the diplomatic defensive. Members of the prime minister's own party publicly began to question his handling of the matter. \"The fact that the video was leaked is a big mistake for the government,\" said legislator Hiroshi Kawauchi, of the prime minister's ruling Democratic Party of Japan. \"It is totally different from presenting it to the public in an official manner, and it leads (to) the people's further erosion of faith in Japan's government.\" In the weekend interview with CNN, the prime minister defended his actions. \"I believe in any country that matters that relate to its territory provoke strong sentiments among people of that country. But I trust five years, 10 years down the road, people then will appreciate my cabinet dealt with the issue in a calm manner.\" While the prime minister must try to contain the diplomatic damage with China, the most pressing matter in the week leading up to the APEC summit will be economic issues. Kan strongly defended his government's right to intervene in the currency market, in attempts to weaken the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. dollar. Japan had little choice, he suggested, since U.S. policy has been to boost the U.S. economy. \"With regard to the strong yen, the basic cause is the U.S. economy was undergoing changes with everything being skewed to a weak dollar,\" said Kan. \"Should there be excessive fluctuations in exchange markets, then we need to take resolute actions. In fact, we've already intervened in the market once. This remains an option we can take again.\" How long Kan remains in his job is a constant question lobbed publicly by many pundits in Japan. The topic is a natural one, as there have been five Japanese prime ministers in four years. Prime Minister Kan asserted he's shown leadership and results, producing a rare-earth minerals partnership with Vietnam and the deepening of an economic pact with India. \"As we move forward by achieving concrete results, one after another, these will become more visible to the Japanese people. I still have three more years in my term in office. If I firmly implement policies, I trust I will be able to have the support of the Japanese people,\" Kan said.\n### Response : ", "target": "Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan faces a maze of domestic and international issues .\nEconomic issues are at the forefront in the week leading up to the APEC summit in Japan .\nIn a CNN interview, Kan defends his government's intervention in the currency market .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

They have encouraged Asian countries like India, Japan and South Korea -- key consumers of Iranian oil -- to cut back their purchases. U.S. officials say India has lowered the amount of oil it buys from Iran in recent months. But Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government is also wrestling with stubbornly high inflation and is wary of provoking upward pressure on prices. India imports about 70% of the oil it uses, with around 10% to 14% estimated to come from Iran. Clinton said Monday that there was an \"adequate\" supply of oil \"in the marketplace.\" Key world powers met with Iran earlier this month about its intentions for its nuclear program and announced that the next meeting would take place in late May. Iran maintains it is not planning to build a bomb. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has cautioned that he doesn't think the economic sanctions are having an effect. Clinton argued in favor of the current approach on Monday. \"We do not believe Iran would have come to the table if there had not been sanctions and pressure,\" Clinton said Monday. \"We do not believe Iran will peacefully resolve this unless the pressure continues.\" She made the comments before she traveled to New Delhi, where she is met with Singh and other top officials.

{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given review.\n### Input:(CNN) -- Romania insisted Wednesday there was no evidence it had hosted secret CIA prisons as part of the United States' \"global war on terror\" after September 11, 2001. The country \"has no information whatsoever showing that there existed secret CIA detention centers on its territory,\" the Foreign Ministry told CNN. Two investigations also failed to find any evidence that the CIA used Romanian airports for \"rendition,\" the process in which detainees in American custody are transported for questioning to other countries where prohibitions on torture are not as strict and American laws don't apply. The Romanian denial comes in response to a plea from the human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe that countries that have hosted secret CIA prisons come clean. Thomas Hammarberg said Romania, Poland and Lithuania were among at least seven countries that hosted \"black sites\" for \"enhanced interrogation\" during the \"war on terror.\" \"Darkness still enshrouds those who authorized and ran the black sites on European territories,\" he said. \"The full truth must now be established and guarantees given that such forms of co-operation will never be repeated.\" CIA officials have acknowledged the rendition program, but refused to discuss details and denied violating any laws. Efforts to challenge the agency and get details about it in U.S. courts have been turned aside. Hammarberg said the CIA had held \"high-value detainees,\" including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, in Poland between 2002 and 2003. The Polish site closed and a new secret prison opened in Romania in 2003, Hammarberg charged, and existed for more than two years. Lithuania also hosted two sites, he said. Polish prosecutors and Lithuanian lawmakers have investigated the phenomenon, but Romania has shown \"little genuine will to uncover the whole truth,\" Hammarberg charged. \"Effective investigations are imperative and long overdue,\" he said. Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it would not comment while prosecutors in the country are still investigating. Lithuania has not responded to CNN questions about the issue. Hammarberg's statement comes as documents seized from Moammar Gadhafi's compound in Libya shed light on the program of extraordinary rendition. CNN saw a March 6, 2004, CIA letter to Libyan officials about Abdel Hakim Belhaj, a former jihadist with the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group and now a senior commander in the anti-Gadhafi forces. It concerned the Malaysian government's arrest of Abdullah al-Sadiq, Belhaj's nom de guerre for his rendition. A CIA officer said the man and his pregnant wife were being placed on a commercial flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to London via Bangkok and then on to Libya. \"We are planning to arrange to take control of the pair in Bangkok and place them on our aircraft for a flight to your country,\" the officer wrote. Belhaj fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan, but left after their fall in 2001 and was arrested in Malaysia in 2004. After some questioning by the CIA, he was sent back to Libya and jailed. The Council of Europe is a 47-member group that promotes democracy and human rights on the continent.

{"source": "### Instruction: How would you encapsulate this?Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- As the old adage goes, \"If you want it done right, do it yourself\" -- and for social activist Rakesh Rajani, those words have become an ethos to live by. Growing up in a low-income family in Tanzania, Rajani quickly learned first hand about the hardships faced by many living in East Africa. At just four years old, he started working in his parents' shop. Later, when he wanted to go to school, Rajani watched his mother fight tooth and nail to find the funds to send him. These definitive childhood moments would set the young man on a path of social justice culminating with his movement, \"Twaweza.\" Meaning \"we can make it happen\" in Swahili, Rajani established the non-profit organization in 2009 with the goal of empowering people through information and building an \"ecosystem of change\" for themselves. Here he sits down with CNN's African Voices to reveal how he is trying to spark a social movement to make a difference for millions of people. Dream big. He tells CNN: \"My dream is that when people wake up in the morning, whether you are a fisherman in my home town of Wanza on the lake there, or whether you are a farmer in Subawanga or in Gulu, or you are a pastoralist in northern Kenya, you wake and you know that your life matters, and that you can do something about it.\" Take responsibility. \"We are forced to have thoughts for ourselves, we are forced to question, we are forced to analyze what is going on, and in the end what we are also beginning to realize is that we can complain all we want and nothing much will happen or we can take responsibility in making things happen, of co-shaping life, and I think that's what's happening,\" says Rajani. Don't sit back, be part of the solution. \"The concept behind Twaweza very much is this, from the ground up, that the citizens are part of the solution. They are part of the solution in terms of solving things themselves, every day; it's not every problem that you need to wait for the president or the minister to solve ... It's not just about complaining, it's not just about pointing fingers, it's about fixing things, it's about coming up with solutions.\" Spark an education revolution. The self-described \"broker of ideas\" says: \"Africa is rising, but Africa is rising for who? Who is benefiting who is not and unfortunately while there are many wonderful things and many economies are growing at rates that are enviable to the West, the reality is that Africa is not rising for many people particularly young people. And that also if we are going to fully benefit from the potential we have in Africa it will need skilled people.\" Partner with politicians to achieve goals. Rajani believes that people need to focus the minds of politicians by highlighting the issues that need to be amended. To wit, a key aim for Twaweza is to seek a greater transparency and accountability in government. \"I could see a whole new modeling practice where a government says, 'in order for us to succeed we need your help, we need your collaboration, we need your ideas, we need your critique.' That new model of government, I think, is the future.\" He adds: \"The old idea that government knows everything and shuts everybody out is now so, so old thinking, it doesn't work that way.\" Bridge the gap between rich and poor. Education in East Africa has been a vital development over the last decade.

{"source": "### Instruction :How would you encapsulate this?WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Nearly 200,000 U.S.-supplied rifles and pistols meant for Iraqi security forces are unaccounted for in Iraq, according to a report to Congress. Loose record-keeping caused the Pentagon and the U.S. command in Iraq to lose track of about 110,000 AK-47 rifles and 80,000 pistols provided to the new Iraqi national police and army, the Government Accountability Office told Congress. The investigative arm of Congress, the GAO also found that 250,000 pieces of body armor and helmets can't be accounted for. The report also says a review of the 2007 property books shows continuing problems with missing and incomplete records. The report, issued July 31, follows an October accounting by the Defense Department's special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, which put the number of weapons missing at close to 500,000. Auditors were unable to determine whether the weapons -- which included heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers -- were stolen, being used by insurgents or still in the hands of Iraqi units. A Pentagon official in Baghdad, who asked not to be identified, said some of the weapons went back to Iraqi forces and some were destroyed. But he conceded some of them may be missing. Asked whether they ended up in the hands of insurgents, he said there was no hard data, but \"anything is possible.\" Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Monday he is not aware of any reports that show U.S. weapons designated for Iraqi security forces have been found in the hands of insurgents. The missing weapons mostly dated back to former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's rule, and none had serial numbers, the official said. Coalition commanders have tightened procedures for tracking the weapons, including using biometric data from Iraqi soldiers and police -- and since June, Iraqi units have been issued U.S.-made M-16 and M-4 rifles, which are electronically tracked, the official said. Officials with the U.S. training command blamed insufficient staff and the lack of a \"fully operational distribution network\" for the poor record-keeping, the GAO report states. Coalition trainers did not keep centralized records of the equipment they issued to Iraqi police and troops before December 2005, and the coalition \"has not consistently collected supporting documents that confirm when the equipment was received, the quantities of equipment delivered, or the Iraqi units receiving the equipment.\" The report said the U.S. commander in charge of training Iraqi forces reported about 185,000 AK-47 rifles, 170,000 pistols, 215,000 items of body armor, and 140,000 helmets were issued to Iraqi security forces as of September 2005, while the accounting books from the U.S. military contained records for only about 75,000 AK-47 rifles, 90,000 pistols, 80,000 items of body armor, and 25,000 helmets. The GAO recommended the Pentagon set accountability standards for the training program and make sure it has adequate staff and technology to oversee the program. The GAO also recommended the Secretary of Defense determine what DOD accountability procedures should apply to the program and ensure sufficient staff, functioning distribution networks, and proper technology are available to meet the requirements. The Defense Department concurred with the recommendations and has begun a review \"to ensure proper accountability is in place for the Iraq train-and-equip program,\" the report states. Pentagon officials said Monday the accounting systems should be \"continuously improved upon and refined.\" According to the report the United States has provided $19.2 billion to develop the Iraqi security forces and the United States has asked for another $2 billion to continue training and equipping Iraqi troops.

Jim Jones' jungle compound in South America for at least two years before 909 Americans died there at the command of their cult leader, CNN has learned. Sources in Guyana said the Jonestown camp began obtaining shipments of cyanide -- about a quarter to a half-pound of the deadly poison each month -- as early as 1976, well before most of Jones' followers made the move there. CNN's Soledad O'Brien tells the story of the last hours of Jonestown -- and the few who did survive out of desperation and daring -- as CNN Presents \"Escape from Jonestown.\" Jones led his followers to their death after his gunmen killed a visiting congressman, Rep. Leo Ryan, and four others, including an NBC News correspondent and his cameraman, on November 18, 1978. Jones told the members of his Peoples Temple church that the Guyanese Army would invade their settlement after the murders. He demanded that parents kill their children first, then take their own lives, rather than face the authorities because of what Jones had done. Of the 909 who died, 303 were children -- from teens to toddlers. Many were killed by Jones' loyalists, who used syringes to squirt cyanide down their throats.  Jones stockpiled cyanide \u00bb . CNN was told Jones obtained a jeweler's license to buy cyanide. The chemical can be used to clean gold. But there was no jeweler's operation in Jonestown. Six months before Ryan arrived on a one-man investigative mission, the settlement's doctor wrote in a memo to Jones: . \"Cyanide is one of the most rapidly acting poisons. ... I would like to give about two grams to a large pig to see how effective our batch is.\" The purchases are \"strong evidence that the Rev. Jim Jones had been plotting the death of his followers long before that fateful day,\" O'Brien reports. Ryan, the only U.S. representative assassinated in office, was shot at a nearby airstrip as he tried to leave with 15 church members who told him Jones was holding people captive in the remote jungle encampment. \"That was literally a jungle prison,\" said Gerald Parks, whose wife, Patricia, was shot to death in the airport attack.  How did he escape death? \u00bb  Four other members of his family survived, including two young daughters who were lost in the jungle for three days after running away from the airstrip to hide from the killers.  Woman returns to scene for first time \u00bb . \"It was a dictatorship,\" said Vernon Gosney, who was badly wounded in the airport shootings. \"It was supposed to be socialism, but it really was fascism.\" Jones was a phony faith healer who moved his Indiana church to northern California in the mid-'60s in search of a safe place to survive the possibility of nuclear warfare. In the mid-'70s, when a magazine raised questions about church beatings and financial abuses, Jones moved his flock to Guyana, in South America, to the jungle settlement he called his \"beautiful promised land.\" \"It was a slave camp run by a madman,\" said Leslie Wilson, a young mother then only 21, who began walking away from Jonestown early on the day that ended in the suicides and murder. She and 10 others trudged almost 30 miles through the jungle to another town. Wilson carried her 3-year-old son on her back. \"It was a freedom walk,\" she said. \"It was a walk to freedom.\" Tim Carter, a Jones aide, stayed in the camp almost to the end and saw his wife and his 1-year-old son die before he was sent away on an errand.   Authorities made him return two days later to help identify bodies. Carter saw Jones lying with a bullet hole in the side of his head. \"I remember thinking the son of a bitch didn't even die the way everybody else died,\" Carter said.\n### Response :", "target": "In 1978, 909 Americans were led to mass murder-suicide by the Rev.

{"source": "### Instruction: I need a summary of the review.San Diego, California (CNN) -- And then they came for the children. Just when you thought Arizona lawmakers couldn't stoop any lower, these cowardly and shameful politicians grab a shovel and put in a basement. This fall, the Arizona legislature is expected to debate a bill that would deny birth certificates to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants -- the \"anchor babies\" that some Republicans have been trying to marginalize for years. The lawmakers are cowards because, first, they go after illegal immigrants who don't vote, lobby or contribute to political campaigns. And now they're going after children who don't vote, lobby or contribute to political campaigns. Whom are they not going after? Employers of illegal immigrants. You know why? Because they vote, lobby and contribute to political campaigns. By the way, the term \"anchor babies,\" which refers to the tots that supposedly increase the chances that mommy and daddy can stay in the United States even if mommy and daddy are in the country illegally, isn't just offensive and crude. It's also misleading. The fact that Elvira Arellano, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was famously holed up in a Chicago, Illinois, church, had a U.S.-born son didn't stop federal officials from deporting her in 2007. Some anchor. The real anchor is a job, the kind eagerly provided by U.S. employers who thumb their noses at federal law prohibiting the hiring of illegal immigrants. In fact, right-wingers acknowledge as much when they argue that if we dry up the jobs, illegal immigrants will self-deport. What about their kids, some of which were born in the United States? Why not stay for them? Simple: Employment takes precedence. Thus, according to conservatives' own arguments, there aren't anchor babies -- only anchor jobs. Also, you can bet that some of the same people who oppose citizenship for the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants also oppose the idea of granting a pathway to earned legalization -- what they call \"amnesty\" -- to illegal immigrants. Why? Because, they say, you can't willy-nilly convert those who are illegal to legal. Then how can those folks be so cavalier about making that conversion in the opposite direction by changing legal to illegal? Lastly, one of the things you hear from amnesty opponents is that illegal immigrants should certainly not be given U.S. citizenship. It's just too valuable, they say. Agreed. But if it's so valuable, then why are some on the right so quick to strip it away from the children of illegal immigrants? Don't U.S. citizens deserve more respect than that? Apparently not. In the late 1990s, the member of Congress leading the crusade against \"birthright citizenship\" was Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-California. The San Diego-area congressman proposed a bill to limit the privilege to the children of U.S. citizens. The legislation didn't go anywhere. It couldn't even get a hearing from some of Bilbray's fellow Republicans, who cringed at the idea of visiting the sins of the parents onto the children. The same was true for another failed attempt by Rep. Nathan Deal, R-Georgia, who, in 2005, proposed a bill that explicitly denied citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. The bill didn't go anywhere either, in part because not enough Republicans would even agree to give it a hearing. That same year, I discussed the idea with Rep. James Sensenbrenner, who was then chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and the author of a sweeping piece of legislation called \"The Border Protection, Anti-Terrorism, and Immigration Control Act of 2005.\" Among other things, the bill would have made unauthorized presence in the United States a felony. Yet even Sensenbrenner, not exactly a softhearted liberal, wouldn't touch the idea of denying citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. When fellow Republicans tried to insert such language into his bill, he was careful to keep it out. There was a time when Republicans knew better than to handle radioactive material. My, how times have changed. And now all the opponents of birthright citizenship have to do is change the Constitution. The 14th Amendment makes clear that anyone born in the United States, with the possible exception of the children of foreign diplomats, is a U.S. citizen. \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Grasping at straws, restrictionists and nativists claim that illegal immigrants aren't \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. So what? My concern isn't that critics don't know how to read the law. It's that they don't know how to read -- period. Jurisdiction applies not to the parents, but to the children. As U.S. citizens, they're subject to U.S. laws, but they also enjoy the protection of the U.S. Constitution. The closed border / closed mind crowd may not like it, but that's the way it is. I'm not surprised that this escapes the state of Arizona. iReporter supports the bill . Given all that's happened in recent weeks in its jihad against not illegal immigrants but Hispanics in general, the Grand Canyon State seems to have more than its share of people who slept through high school civics, and they're being advised by lawyers who were obviously absent the day they taught \"law\" in law school.

{"source": "### Instruction:Give me a one line summary of the story below:(CNN)  -- As a player who has won African and Olympic titles with Cameroon and Spanish league and Champions League titles with Barcelona as well as three African footballer of the year awards, Samuel Eto'o expects to command respect. Barcelona star Samuel Eto'o is one of a number of top footballers who have spoken out against racism. Yet Eto's spectacular career in Spain, where his goalscoring prowess have made him one of the world's most feared and admired strikers, has been punctuated by incidents in which he has been the victim of sickening racist abuse. Memorably, Eto'o started to walk off the pitch in protest during a match at Real Zaragoza in 2006 after being taunted by home supporters chanting monkey noises only to be persuaded to return by his Barcelona teammates and the club's coach, Frank Rijkaard. \"I was leaving the field and if it wasn't for Rijkaard, my teammates and the referee, I would have done it,\" Eto'o recalls. \"In that moment you start thinking whether there is something wrong with being black, you know? But I think we are all humans, everyone's blood is the same color and we all have the same heart. I don't see any differences in skin color.\" While Spanish football's reputation for sophistication and flair has made la Liga one of the most attractive and marketable competitions in world football, attitudes in the stands have not always kept apace with the cosmopolitanism on display on the pitch. Nor has positive leadership always come from the top. Real Zaragoza were fined just 9,000 euros ($13,800) for the abuse directed by their supporters at Eto'o. And in 2005, the Spanish national coach Luis Aragones -- currently steering Spain through Euro 2008 -- was at the center of controversy when he used a racist slur to describe French striker Thierry Henry, now a teammate of Eto'o's at Barcelona. Eto'o admits that racism is so widespread in Spain that he no longer dares take his family to matches. \"Racism can happen anywhere and I don't want them to see it,\" he told CNN. \"It's a sad situation in football. In my opinion the problem is getting bigger and the people that should come up with a solution are not doing it. So to protect my family, I don't take them to the game.\" With black players regularly subjected to monkey chants in Spanish stadiums, Eto'o believes determined action is needed before verbal abuse spills over into physical violence. \"The authorities are working to find solutions. But they must find them. We can't wait until some crazy fan jumps from his seat and kills a black player before measures are taken. The players are revolted by it and we try to help each other. But the authorities must find a way to set an example.\" One of the saddest aspects of racism in football is that many of those who participate in taunting colored players would never dream of behaving the same way on the street, at work or at home. But Eto'o fears attitudes in stadiums may reflect wider social attitudes which find expression amid the passion, emotion and anonymity of the football crowd . \"Football stadiums are just a reflection of what is going on in society,\" Eto'o says. \"Many times in stadiums people just feel more relaxed and say what they think when they're somewhere else.\" He believes the Spanish media has a key part to play in tackling racism in football, not just by highlighting incidents of abuse but in creating an environment in which racism in the stands is no longer quietly condoned. \"I don't make the decisions, but something needs to be done. Right now, the media here pays attention to the incidents of racism, but doesn't discuss solutions. That's the tragedy. They use these images to create an impact rather than to identify racism as a problem and to urge people to find a solution. TV has a lot of weight on public opinion and what the industry must do is make people feel a social responsibility to stop this kind of behavior.\"\n### Response:", "target": "Samuel Eto'o: \"We can't wait until some crazy fan kills a black player\"\nBarcelona striker has endured regular racist taunting while playing in Spain .\nEto'o almost walked off during a match in 2006 because of sustained abuse .\nHe no longer allows family to come to games to protect them from racism .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?\n### Input:Moscow, Russia(CNN) -- Unidentified gunmen killed two people and injured another two Wednesday in what Russian officials called a terrorist attack intended to blow up a hydroelectric power station. The attackers targeted the Baksan Hydropower Plant in the North Caucasus republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's Office said. They killed two guards and badly beat two control-room operators, authorities said. \"At about 4 a.m., perpetrators wearing masks penetrated inside the station and tied their hands with tape,\" Valery Shogenov, the hydroelectric station's manager, told Russian state television on the backdrop of his plant still smoking. \"But the operators managed to finally free themselves from the tape and call us about the accident,\" he said. While at the station, the gunmen triggered off four improvised explosive devices that destroyed two of its three hydropower generators and caused a fire in the control room. Later, investigators defused a fifth device planted by the bombers that didn't explode. Russian security officials said the same gunmen had attacked a local police station in Baksan vullage with grenade launchers shortly before storming into the power plant. \"The possible suspects have been determined now,\" the Russian National Antiterrorist Committee said in a statement. \"Government bodies are keeping the situation under their control,\" it said. The special crisis center of the republic's law enforcement agencies said three to five people were behind the attack. RusHydro, the country's power-generating company, said on its website that the fire had been extinguished, but part of the control room's equipment is damaged and needs replacement. RusHydro also said security has been boosted at all its hydroelectric plants across Russia's restive northern Caucasus region. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin instructed government officials to take \"speedy measures to fully restore the power plant.\" The Baksan hydroelectric plant was built in 1936. Russian media said this was the first time in the country's history that a power plant was attacked by terrorists.\n### Response :", "target": "Unidentified gunmen kill two people, injure two more .\nAttackers wearing masks storm the power station at 4 a.m.\nOfficials: Gunmen attacked police station before power plant .\nRusHydro says security boosted at all its hydroelectric plants .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?\n### Input:(CNN) -- A former top Colombian official survived an assassination attempt Tuesday after a daylight bombing in the country's capital, authorities said. Fernando Londono, a former interior and justice minister, was among at least 39 people injured in the Bogota blast. He was being treated at a hospital, President Juan Manuel Santos said. \"I want to condemn this in the strongest terms,\" he said, adding that the motive for the attack was unknown. Londono's driver and his head of security were killed, Santos said. A chaotic scene unfolded as the blast hit a commercial neighborhood in a city where such attacks have become rare. All the windows on a bus were blown out, and blood was all over the area, witness German Diaz said. People panicked, he said. Some cried. Video showed shattered glass and scattered car parts covering the street as rescuers arrived. Security cameras at the Bogota intersection recorded a man crossing the street while cars were stopped at a red light, CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported. The man threw a package at the vehicle Londono was riding in, then sped away on a waiting motorcycle, the CNN affiliate said. Colombian authorities were offering a 500 million peso ($280,000) reward for information leading to the capture of those responsible for the attack, Santos said. Earlier Tuesday, police detected and deactivated a car bomb in central Bogota. Santos told reporters Tuesday evening that there was no evidence linking the two incidents. Mayor Gustavo Petro suggested the attack could have something to do with the U.S.-Colombia Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect on Tuesday. \"We think it is a plan aimed at trying to destabilize the city on the precise day when the free trade agreement begins,\" he told reporters. He urged the city's residents to remain calm and report anything suspicious to authorities. Londono served as minister of interior and justice from 2002 to 2004 during the administration of President Alvaro Uribe. He was known for being outspoken against leftist rebel groups, including the Armed Revolutionary Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Londono travels with a sizable security detail because of numerous threats against him. Rebels say they'll free French journalist . Even as Santos said authorities were still trying to determine who was behind the blast, one police official blamed the rebel group. \"Nobody else could have done it, and we have reasons to say what we are saying,\" Bogota Police Chief Luis Eduardo Martinez told reporters, according to Caracol. Analysts offered a similar assessment. \"It has all the hallmarks of a FARC operation,\" said Cynthia Arnson, director of the Latin America program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. The bombing comes as recent Colombian government operations and policies have caused significant setbacks for the rebel group, she said. \"This kind of attack in Bogota has become extremely rare, but nonetheless seems designed to drive home a political point, that the guerrillas retain this capacity for violence,\" Arnson said. Several bomb blasts occur every year in Bogota, but assassination attempts are uncommon, said Ben West, senior tactical analyst for Stratfor. The last one occurred in 2007, when a letter bomb was sent to the deputy education minister, he said. In the 1980s and 1990s, high-profile attacks targeting government officials were more common in Colombia, he said. \"I'd say for about the past 10 years, it's been much more quiet,\" West said. \"One attack doesn't make a trend. It could just be an outlier, but it is significant that it was an assassination attempt, not just a random bombing. ... It is a more sophisticated attack.\" Local media reports have speculated that the attack could be connected with the trade agreement, he said, and some have suggested local criminal gangs could be behind it. But the FARC seems to have the strongest motive and capabilities to mount such an attack, West said. The rebels could be responding to a new government approach that expands the focus of military operations beyond the group's leaders, he said. \"They're going after all the FARC members. They're trying to be more disruptive rather than surgical. If they're successful in this, it's going to get a response from the FARC,\" West said. \"An attack like this, in Bogota, in the capital of the country, where the government is, it could be a response to the new strategy the government is taking.\" Journalist Fernando Ramos contributed to this report from Bogota.

Shoichet reported from Atlanta.\n### Response:", "target": "Officials don't know who was behind the blast, President Juan Manuel Santos says .\nAuthorities are offering a $280,000 reward for information, he says .\nThe attack targeted a former minister of interior and justice .\nAt least two people were killed and dozens were injured .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.\n### Input :BEIJING, China (CNN) -- If 63-year-old Chinese scholar Zhou Duo had his way, he would be on hunger strike on June 4, sitting quietly through the day at Purple Bamboo Park, 20 minutes' taxi ride from Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Zhou Duo wants to mark the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown with a hunger strike. His aim: to mark the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown and to dramatize his defiant call for answers from Chinese authorities. \"What is the truth?\" he pressed rhetorically, as he discussed his plans with CNN a week earlier. \"How many people were in fact robbed of their lives? The truth remains unknown, because the Chinese government has suppressed information about the truth on June 4th.\" On that day 20 years ago, Chinese troops in armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled toward Tiananmen Square. That was where Zhou, along with three other intellectuals, including Taiwanese singer-composer Hou Dejian, were on the second day of a hunger strike to show solidarity with student protesters. The soldiers, on strict orders to clear Tiananmen Square of demonstrators, had forced their way through the city's main thoroughfare. Along the way, they met fierce resistance from students and city residents who barricaded the streets, so they fired at them. When the firing stopped, hundreds if not thousands of people lay maimed or dead. A few hours past midnight on June 4, Zhou and the protesters on the square found themselves surrounded by troops and tanks, and yet several holdouts wanted to \"resist till death.\" Sensing a sure bloodbath, Zhou and Hou appeased the hotheads and took control of their ranks. Gingerly, the two approached army officers and negotiated an agreement that allowed the demonstrators to withdraw peacefully. After they dispersed, some stayed home, some were arrested, and others became fugitives. Three days later, Zhou went into hiding after he learned that the computer company he worked for as a policy planner had become the target of a witch hunt. Weeks later, police caught the bespectacled sociologist. He was detained but was not formally charged or tried. He was released months later. Any regrets? \"None at all,\" Zhou said firmly. \"I would regret enormously if I hadn't done what I did and if hadn't saved the lives of so many people (on the square). This single reason is enough. Had I not done that, I would be hitting my head against the wall every day.\" Despite the painful memories, Zhou said, he remains cautiously optimistic about how grassroots activism has grown in China. \"There is a huge difference now compared with 20 years ago,\" Zhou told CNN two weeks before the June 4 anniversary. \"I think the citizens are becoming more aware of their rights. It's especially shown in the ranks of the NGOs (nongovernment organizations), lawyers and intellectuals. This is an important sign that the citizens' consciousness has waken up in China.\" Accordingly, Zhou has sought to abide by laws and regulations. A week before the June 4 anniversary, Zhou prepared to drive to a police station to apply for a permit to conduct his day-long hunger strike. He wrote an application, even detailing that he would simply sit quietly in the park, carrying a banner that would read: \"Publicize the truth of June 4 -- reach the goal of reconciliation of society!\" But Zhou did not even make it to the station. Police showed up at his home and talked him and his wife into going along with them for a \"vacation\" at a government-owned hostel. Reached by phone on June 3, Zhou's wife said good-naturedly: \"We are both fine. We are having a good time teaching the police about democracy.\" She said they expected to return to the city a week later, after the June 4 anniversary jitters had subsided.\n### Response :", "target": "Zhou: \"Chinese government has suppressed information about the truth on June 4th\"\nHe and another, Hou, negotiated deal allowing protesters to leave peacefully .\nNo regrets, Zhou says .\nHe remains cautiously optimistic about grassroots activism .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction: Can you walk me through the main ideas?(CNN) -- Like its trains, contract talks involving Bay Area Rapid Transit remained at a standstill Friday night -- with no plans for even a return to the negotiating table to resolve the system's second strike in three months. The standoff left many of Oakland and San Francisco's iconic bridges, streets and freeways clogged even more than usual during both the morning and evening rush hours on Friday, the first day in which the nation's fifth-largest train system has been shut down. Union officials, at 5 p.m. (8 p.m. ET), publicly detailed what they described as a new plan to end the strike. It includes returning to the previous contract language on all outstanding issues, according to negotiator Josie Mooney. They also offered to bring in a mediator to address the points of contention -- which it says does not include the economic part of any deal, because it says that already has been agreed to -- but rather other issues. \"These (are) real, genuine, thoughtfully written ... steps that will settle all disputes on the table,\" said Roxanne Sanchez, president of the local Service Employees International Union. \"...It's not we win or they lose, but the trains (would be) running.\" BART management quickly dismissed the proposal \"as simply a repeat\" of a previous \"unacceptable\" offer, said spokesman Jim Allison. BART is open to mediation, but only if it's on the whole package rather than \"cherry-picking the parts they like and leaving behind the parts they don't like.\" \"We're calling on union leaders to return to the bargaining table that continues (to address) all of the issues as a whole,\" Allison said. BART, whose system normally serves 26 communities including San Francisco and Oakland, has chartered buses during the strike for highly limited but free rush-hour service. Buses departed certain stations in the morning directly for San Francisco, then carried passengers back to those stations in the afternoon. That was expected to help about 6,000 passengers in each direction, according to BART. Still, that's just a fraction of the roughly 400,000 people who use the service daily. And for some of them -- like those behind a petition to ban BART strikes, as is done for other transit systems around the nation -- patience is running thin. \"I think the public would have such bad blood this time around for both BART and the unions,\" BART rider Kyle Brunnette, 53, told CNN affiliate KTVU before trains stopped earlier this week. BART and workers' unions have been negotiating a new contract for months. Union leaders said the latest strike was called because management made a late push to change worker rules, the framework governing issues such as how work is assigned and what shifts people can work. This came after the unions made concessions to reach an \"economic framework agreement\" -- after six months of talks -- on wages, pensions and health care, Pete Castelli, a local executive director of the Service Employees International Union, said Friday. \"Basically what management did was produce, in essence, a poison pill, saying, 'Great, we made this amazing progress after six months, we have an economic framework agreement. But wait, there's more. You must take this now,' \" Castelli said. \"At that point ... the negotiations broke down.\" BART objected to that characterization in a couple of ways. First, the sides haven't agreed on wages, BART spokesman Rick Rice said. \"We're still at a 12% pay increase over four years (at 3% per year),\" he said. \"The union's last proposal was higher than that.\" Second, Rice said, changes to worker rules -- such as ditching a regulation that requires communicating with handwritten notes and faxing in favor of using more modern technology -- have \"been in our package since April 1.\" \"How they can think this is a surprise is simply not credible,\" he said. Castelli said he wants BART to agree to arbitration on the worker rules, but not on the economic issues, which he considered all but set. Rice, though, said that was unacceptable. \"We can't split the package apart,\" he said. \"We can't take one part of this -- the work rules -- to arbitration (and) leave the rest of it on the table to negotiate.\" BART said earlier this week that its \"best and final proposal\" included the wage raises as well as increases in pensions and medical coverage. The BART board would take the whole package -- \"because we do not have agreement on the salary increases,\" she said -- to binding arbitration. The unions seek \"20% plus salary increases,\" she said. \"The issues that remain unresolved are not minor. We cannot get tired and give up. They get to the heart of BART's need to function efficiently and economically,\" the BART general manager said. Castelli apologized to the area's commuters. \"We're very sorry. We understand that this strike -- what it does to the Bay Area riders, and we understand that it is a hardship. ... We apologize,\" he said. \"We urge the public to contact the BART district and tell them to finish negotiating a fair deal with our union.\" BART workers also went on strike in the summer, paralyzing the San Francisco regional transportation system for four days in July.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?(CNN) -- A police search at a Cleveland, Ohio, property where the remains of 11 women were found, as well as an adjoining property, turned up no additional human remains, authorities said Wednesday. Six members of the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office's office were on standby Wednesday as investigators returned to the home to dig by hand, according to a coroner's spokesman. The digging focused on areas on the property of Anthony Sowell, a registered sex offender who served 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted rape, as well as a property next door. \"Investigators removed various items that will be examined for investigative value,\" Cleveland police Lt. Thomas Stacho said in a statement. No more remains were found, he said, and no further search of either home or yard is planned. Federal agents, meanwhile, have nearly completed a timeline tracing Sowell's whereabouts from his days in the military and beyond, Scott Wilson, spokesman for the FBI's Cleveland office, told CNN. Cleveland homicide detectives asked the FBI to trace Sowell's life from the time he joined the Marines at age 18 to his life in Ohio. In the military, Sowell was based in California, North Carolina and even Japan before moving back to Ohio after spending eight years in the Marines. \"We're looking for any unsolved crimes to match what happened here,\" Wilson said. Given the number of bodies found at Sowell's home, crime experts have told CNN, it wouldn't be uncommon for authorities to look for links to other unsolved cases. Police and the FBI have said they're looking at the unsolved murders of three women in East Cleveland to determine if they share any similarities with the remains of 11 women found at Sowell's home between October 29 and November 3. Sowell faces five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths. In addition, police in Coronado, California, are attempting to determine if Sowell is linked to a 1979 rape there. Sowell's DNA will be entered into a national database to see whether it can be linked to any unsolved crimes. The timeline is just a start, Wilson said. \"We'll take several weeks to a month before we get all these leads out to our other offices for them to take a look at.\" Investigators returned to Sowell's home to search it and the adjacent property on Friday and Saturday. They used thermal-imaging equipment and ground-penetrating radar and marked several areas outside the home with spray paint. The search Wednesday focused on areas identified during the recent use of thermal imaging equipment and radar technology, Stacho said.

{"source": "### Instruction:Read the following passage and summarize it.(CNN) -- It would be easy to look at the current conflict, Hamas's militant fighters and smaller militias firing rockets in to Israel and Israel's crushing bomb and missile barrages, as a repeat of the 2008/2009 confrontation that killed more than 1,300 men, women and children. But it is not. Hamas is in a whole new place now. Still trapped in the crowded confines of Gaza's close packed neighborhoods where they were elected six years ago, only now with more friends outside. What has changed came in the wake of the Arab Spring that swept away some of Israel's old regional allies replacing them with leaders more sympathetic to Hamas. Israel and Hamas: How the conflict reignited . Gone is Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak whom Israel could and did rely on to blockade Gaza and squeeze Hamas in 2008/2009. Gone is the Egyptian state repression of freedom of speech that helped keep in check popular anti-Israel passion. Instead -- almost unthinkable four years ago -- Hamas's political leader holds a live news conference in Cairo, as Israeli shells strike Palestinian broadcasters in Gaza. If proof of Egypt's new role was needed, this was it. Egypt didn't just send Prime Minister Hisham Qandil to Gaza Friday with expressions of support for Gazans, but handed Hamas the bullhorn for propaganda when it needed it most. It is a remarkable turnaround. Khalid Meshal, Hamas's political leader, reveled in the spotlight, as he described a new, much more Hamas-friendly Egypt. Q&A: What is Hamas? But Egypt is far from alone in the regional revolution that begins to isolate Israel. The tiny Gulf state of Qatar has proven perhaps the influential political player, helping shape the region the way it wants. It has been seen to favor governments like that in Egypt with roots closely tied to the moderate Islamist Muslim Brotherhood of which the Palestinian Hamas is a radical off-shoot, but long aligned with Iran. Last month when the Emir of Qatar made an historic visit to Gaza promising $400 million of aid, it appeared he was trying to pull Hamas away from Iran and closer to Qatar. Qatar has been laying the groundwork for this for some time. When Hamas leader Khalid Meshal fled exile from the spiraling civil war in Syria earlier this year it was the Qataris whose offer of safe sanctuary he accepted. The Qataris have leverage in a way they never did in the past. So where does this leave Israel? Simply put, while Israel is stronger militarily, it is in a weaker political position than it was in 2009. Why Israel might hesitate to start a ground invasion . Egypt is not going to help blockade Gaza by constricting the Rafa border crossing, or by offering the same level of intelligence cooperation to Israel that they have in the past. Indeed, by some estimates Egypt's security services no longer have the same control over Islamist militants as they once did. Many have been released from jail and are quietly regrouping in the capital's sprawling suburbs or the sparsely populated and almost lawless Sinai desert bordering Israel. If the Israeli government had hoped to count on some shreds of Mubarak-era support, it will be disappointed. Today's Egyptian rhetoric, while falling short of abrogating the peace treaty with Israel, has very much taken a pro-Hamas line. The long universal of the Arab world is a dislike of the Israeli state's treatment of Palestinians. In the past most Arab leaders were dictators, able to take a path far different from the views of the Arab street. Not any more. The region's new post-Arab Spring democratically-elected leaders are only too aware of the radical hardliners waiting for an opportunity.

Eli Roth and Brad Pitt star in \"Inglourious Basterds.\" Roth also directed a short film within the film. Tarantino said he's not worried people might be offended by the short film, which is being promoted by a trailer that is now a viral video on the Internet. \"You would have to have absolutely, positively no sense of humor at all not to get it,\" Tarantino said. \"Stolz der Nation\" -- which translates into English as \"Nation's Pride\" -- was produced true to the style of Joseph Goebbels, Adolf Hitler's propaganda minister, but by Eli Roth, the director-actor who also plays one of Tarantino's \"Basterds\" known as the \"Bear Jew.\" \"There was something that we enjoyed immensely about the idea of a Jew making a Nazi propaganda movie,\" Tarantino said.  Watch Tarantino talk about how \"Nation's Pride\" was made \u00bb . Roth, well known for his R-rated horror flicks such as \"Hostel,\" said while growing up as a Jewish boy in Boston, Massachusetts, he never dreamed he would make a Nazi propaganda film. \"After 'Hostel 2,' I thought 'God, what can I make that's more offensive and upsetting than this film,' but somehow I did it with 'Nation's Pride,'\" Roth said. Roth viewed the black-and-white film as a character in \"Inglourious Basterds,\" a World War II fairy tale about a squad of Jewish-American soldiers who infiltrate behind enemy lines to terrorize the German army. Their plot to assassinate Hitler focuses on a small Paris, France, theater where Germany's leadership is gathered for the premiere of Goebbels' movie. The black-and-white film glorifies a fictional war hero played by Daniel Bruhl \"and the glory of the swastika and the power of Germany,\" Roth said. \"His courage was bound by duty. His legend was baptized in blood. His name will be crowned in glory,\" the trailer's narrator says as Pvt. Fredrick Zoller picks off dozens of American soldiers from a sniper's nest. \"Being Jewish, I wanted to make it a real propaganda film,\" Roth said. \"I was, like, I want to show what these movies are like. I don't want to do a sanitized version.\" Using just 20 extras and five stuntmen, Roth shot the five-and-a-half-minute film in three days in Gorlitz, Germany, the same town where \"The Reader\" was filmed a year earlier, he said. \"The whole time we were shooting, we were, like, not only does this have to impress Quentin, this has got to impress the Fuhrer,\" he said. \"Hitler has to see this and go 'This is your finest work.'\" \"The German crew were going 'God, normally, we can't do this.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?\n### Input :(CNN)  -- A former NASA astronaut accused of assaulting a romantic rival at a Florida airport can take off her electronic tracking bracelet while she awaits trial, a judge ruled Thursday. Attorneys for former astronaut Lisa Nowak said her ankle bracelet was uncomfortable and inconvenient. The bracelet was uncomfortable, inconvenient and cost Lisa Nowak $105 a week, her attorneys argued. Those reasons alone weren't enough to order the monitor removed, Orange County Circuit Court Judge Marc Lubet said in his ruling. He said the monitoring device was not fulfilling its purpose. Although the alleged victim, Air Force Capt. Colleen Shipman, testified earlier this month that she remains afraid of Nowak and wants the monitor to remain, Shipman \"chose to travel to the defendant's hometown of Houston, Texas, on three or four occasions ... to visit her boyfriend\" since the incident, Lubet wrote. \"During these trips ... the electronic monitoring GPS device afforded no protection or benefit to Ms. Shipman, as the defendant could freely move about Houston,\" Lubet wrote. \"Under these circumstances, it is clear to this court that the electronic monitoring GPS device does not fulfill its intended purpose of protecting Ms. Shipman.\" Lubet also cited Nowak's lack of a prior criminal record. Nowak is \"relieved\" to have the device removed, according to a statement issued by defense attorney Don Lykkebak. \"It's a great relief not to worry about safety issues related to the batteries' life while I'm driving,\" Nowak said in the statement. \"I'm also really looking forward to getting back into my former aerobic fitness programs.\" Lykkebak's spokeswoman, Marti Mackenzie, said in the statement that Nowak had developed an indentation and abrasions from the device and will now have a chance to heal. Nowak, 44, pleaded not guilty March 22 to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm, battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon. Her trial is to begin next month. If convicted she could face a sentence of up to life in prison. Prosecutors say Nowak drove nearly 900 miles from Houston to Orlando, Florida -- wearing diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and went to Orlando International Airport on February 5. She put on a disguise and followed Shipman from baggage claim to the parking lot, according to court papers. Shipman told police that after she got into her car, Nowak feigned distress and knocked on the window. When Shipman cracked it to talk to her, Nowak sprayed her face with pepper spray, Shipman said. Police said Nowak was apprehended later as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash bin. Nowak has said she merely went to the airport to talk to Shipman, who had begun dating Nowak's former love interest, Navy Cmdr. Bill Oefelein, who was also an astronaut. Oefelein has since left the astronaut corps. Nowak's attorneys earlier this month filed a notice of intent to rely on an insanity defense, saying in court documents her diagnoses include a litany of more than a dozen psychiatric disorders. In his ruling, Lubet noted that Nowak, a Navy captain, would face additional penalties from the military if she were to violate the conditions of her pretrial release. Nowak has no reason to travel to Florida, where Shipman lives, other than to appear in court, consult with her attorneys or fulfill her military duties, he said, and no reason to travel to Virginia -- where Shipman's boyfriend now lives. He ordered her to have no contact with Shipman or Oefelein and not to travel to Virginia, Washington, Maryland, Delaware or Brevard County, Florida, without court approval. Lykkebak said in his statement that Nowak has no problem adhering to the travel restrictions.

{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given review.(CNN)He runs his terror group like a CEO -- with spreadsheets on missions, assassinations and captured assets. And reports from Iraq's government suggest ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may have been hit in airstrikes over the weekend -- though it's not clear whether he was wounded, whose strikes he may have been hit by and in what part of the country he may have been struck. But if al-Baghdadi is dead, what would happen to the radical Sunni militant group? Don't expect ISIS to just crumble. \"It will morph, and new leaders will emerge,\" retired U.S. Maj. Gen. James \"Spider\" Marks said. \"In fact, bear in mind that ISIS leadership originated from Saddam's military. These are very conventionally trained, very professional leaders.\" Odds are al-Baghdadi or the Shura Council, which handles the group's religious and military affairs, has planned this scenario in advance. \"ISIS likely has a clear line of succession,\" said Lauren Squires of the Institute for the Study of War. \"This is a bureaucratic organization with a deep bench ... either Baghdadi has signed off on the line of succession himself or the Shura Council has agreed to a line of succession.\" Top two deputies . Al-Baghdadi has a Cabinet of advisers as well as two top deputies -- Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, who oversees ISIS' mission in Iraq, and Abu Ali al-Anbari, who is in charge of operations in Syria, according to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium. Both men are veteran Iraqi military officials who served under Saddam Hussein. \"These people who had previously served in Saddam Hussein's army were extremely brutal because Saddam Hussein's regime was very brutal,\" said Peter Neumann of King's College. \"But they also inherited the disciplines and the military skills that are now benefiting ISIS in its campaign against its enemies.\" Analysts say al-Turkmani could make a strong case to become the leader of ISIS if al-Baghdadi is taken out. \"He would also have had to have a lot of outstanding qualities either in the political or the military field, and that certainly makes him a potential contender,\" Neumann said. Beneath each deputy are 12 governors for both Iraq and Syria. Those governors handle financial, military, legal, media and intelligence councils, among others. What's interesting about the bureaucratic hierarchy of ISIS is that it looks a lot like those of some Western countries whose values it rejects -- except there's no democracy involved and there's a council tasked with considering who to behead. Another possibility . Then there's Syrian Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the chief spokesman for ISIS who could also take over the group. In September, al-Adnani called for ISIS supporters to launch lone-wolf attacks. Analysts say some of al-Baghdadi's top deputies were imprisoned with the spokesman at Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run detention center in Iraq where al-Baghdadi was also held for at least four years. \"He was able to trust these individuals as sharing his ideology, sharing his hatred for the West.,\" Squires said. The Shura Council's importance . If al-Baghdadi is still alive, there's one group of people who can take him out even without the use of airstrikes or violence. The Shura Council is the religious monitor for ISIS. Not only does it make sure all the local councils and governors are sticking to ISIS' version of Islamic law, it has the ability to stand up to al-Baghdadi. \"The Shura Council has the right to tell Baghdadi to go if he's not adhering to ISIS' religious standards,\" said Jasmine Opperman of the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium. \"It would most probably never happen, but the fact that it's possible indicates the council's prominence.\" She said the recent beheadings of Western hostages James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and David Haines would have fallen under the Shura council's purview. On top of that, Opperman said, the Shura Council also has the power to censure the leadership for running afoul of its interpretation of Sharia law. But what happens if al-Baghdadi dies might just be hypothetical for now. While some Iraqi officials say the ISIS leader was wounded in an airstrike, U.S. officials say they can't confirm whether al-Baghdadi was hit at all. CNN's Dugald McConnell, Nick Thompson, Atika Shubert and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.\n### Response :", "target": "ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may have been wounded in an airstrike .\nEven if he gets killed, a throng of \"very professional leaders\" could take his place .\nAl-Baghdadi has two top deputies, one over operations in Iraq and one over Syria .\nThe Shura Council, ISIS' religious monitor, could tell al-Baghdadi to go .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given text.\n### Input: (CNN)  -- Forget World Cups. For many rugby union players the ultimate accomplishment is being selected to appear for the famed British Lions on their overseas tours. Giant Munster lock Paul O'Connell is leading the 2009 Lions in South Africa. The Lions are comprised of the best players from the four home unions of England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland and competition for places in the squad is fierce as club and country loyalties are put aside. In the modern professional era, Lions tours take place every four years, visiting the southern-hemisphere Tri-Nations powers of New Zealand, South Africa and Australia in rotation. A typical tour will see a series of matches against provincial or regional sides, interspersed with international or Test matches. Midweek fixtures are normally against weaker teams, with the Lions giving all their squad members a chance to play, with stronger opposition for the weekend matches which would include the Tests. The 2009 Lions are touring world champions South Africa, looking to improve on the dismal performance of the 2005 side, which visited New Zealand. Under England's 2003 World Cup winning coach Clive Woodward, the 2005 squad were expected to prosper, but slipped to defeat in all three Test matches against the All Blacks. The team was captained by Brian O'Driscoll, but his tour ended after just two minutes of the first Test when he was controversially 'spear' tackled by Tana Umaga and Keven Mealamu and dislocated his shoulder. O'Driscoll, who led Ireland to the Six Nations Grand Slam this year, was expected to captain the Lions to South Africa, but coach Ian McGeechan gave the job to Munster lock Paul O'Connell. McGeechan has already gone into Lions history, playing on the 1974 and 1977 tours, and coaching winning teams to Australia and South Africa in 1989 and 1997. He also took them to New Zealand in 1993 where the Test series was lost 2-1. The Lions enjoyed their most successful period in the early 1970s with the 1971 team -- inspired by the Welsh half-back pairing of Gareth Edwards and Barry John -- triumphing against the All Blacks in New Zealand. The 1974 Lions were arguably the best-known and most successful of all time, winning three Tests and drawing one in South Africa and going through the tour unbeaten. Under Irish captain Willie John McBride, their uncompromising forward play set up the victories, with their now infamous catch phrase \"get your retaliation in first\" leading to brutal early exchanges in most games. The modern era is a far cry from the first Lions tour back in 1888 which visited Australia and New Zealand with just 21 players from England, Scotland and Wales. They played provincial and local sides without formal Test matches. But it had established a precedent, and the 1891 side was sanctioned by the sport's ruling body the Rugby Football Union (RFU) and played three Tests against South Africa. The 1924 tour to South Africa was the first trip when the term \"the Lions\" became common currency and it has grown from strength to strength since, despite the growing influence of international rugby competitions such as the Tri and Six Nations and the World Cup.\n### Response: ", "target": "British and Irish Lions are selected from England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland .\nTours now take place every four years to Australia, South Africa and New Zealand .\nSelection for the British Lions is highly-coveted by leading rugby players .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?\n### Input: (CNN) -- Three days after a consumers' group called for a meat boycott, the head of Argentina's beef industry said Thursday prices will fall by week's end. Gustavo Valsangiacomo, president of the Argentina Beef Industry Union, declined to say the boycott was responsible for the price drop. But he acknowledged that demand for beef is falling, the official Telam news agency said. \"There are a sum of factors,\" Valsangiacomo told Telam. \"I don't want to take importance away from the boycott, but it will be analyzed by the end of the week. Nonetheless, we undoubtedly believe that prices reached a point that the public cannot and does not want to accept.\" On Monday, an Argentinean consumer group called for a one-week beef boycott in an attempt to lower prices in a nation that eats more beef than anywhere else in the world. The price of beef has increased 40 percent to 50 percent since December, said the Association of Free Consumers, which called for the boycott. The group cited success in a similar recent boycott of tomatoes, which also had risen in price. Within a few days of the tomato boycott, prices dropped, the consumer organization said. Valsangiacomo said the beef industry had reached a particular point in which cattle growers have cheap feed but have tried to maximize their profits. \"There has to be an equilibrium between their costs and what consumers are paying,\" the industry chief said. Argentina -- a nation of nearly 41 million residents and 51 million head of cattle in 2007, the latest year comparison figures are available -- has faced a crisis as cattle supplies have dipped to their lowest levels in 45 years, according to the Argentina Farm Federation. The Association of Free Consumers cites three possible reasons for the decline in cattle stock: a significant increase in the number of slaughtered livestock; an acceleration in the cultivation of soy, with more than 10 million hectares (24.7 million acres) converted from livestock to soy production; and more Argentineans buying beef. Drought also has decreased the size of available pasture land. Argentineans eat more beef than any other nation in the world -- 68 kilograms (150 lbs) per person annually, the Farm Federation said. Despite the high consumption, that's a significant decrease from the 80 kilograms (176 lbs) per person per year in the 1970s, the farmers' group said. Argentinean beef is considered among the best in the world, and the nation is the third-largest exporter in the world, behind Brazil and Australia. But the drastic decline in beef cattle has led some Argentineans to worry the nation eventually could have to import beef to keep up with the high demand.\n### Response:", "target": "Consumer group called for one-week beef boycott to try to lower prices .\nArgentina Beef Industry Union president won't say if boycott responsible for likely price drop .\nPrice of beef has risen 40 percent to 50 percent since December, group says .\nIndustry chief tells news agency public demand for beef on decline .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction: Can you walk me through the main ideas?WASHINGTON (CNN) -- All major indicators of violence in Iraq have dropped by between 40 and 80 percent since February 2007, when President Bush committed an additional 30,000 troops to the war there, the Pentagon reported Monday. The quarterly report to Congress noted that the military, political and economic gains made in the five-year-old war remain \"fragile, reversible and uneven,\" and that Islamic jihadists loyal to al Qaeda in Iraq remain capable of high-profile attacks. But civilian deaths have dropped from a peak of nearly 4,000 a month from December 2006 to January 2007 to about 500 a month as of May, and U.S. troop deaths have dropped from 126 in May 2007 to an all-time low of 19 in May 2008. The report cited the emergence of the Sons of Iraq as a major reason for the downturn in civilian-oriented violence and deaths. The groups are made up of an estimated 90,000 Iraqis, often former insurgents, paid by U.S. commanders to help protect neighborhoods and provide intelligence on extremists. U.S. troop deaths and civilian deaths spiked in March, when Iraqis battled militia forces loyal to Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr in Basra. At the end of March, an operation in Sadr City by U.S. and Iraqi forces to clear out insurgents firing rockets into the Green Zone also kept the death toll up, according to the report. But while the death toll went up in March, it remained lower than the numbers that prevailed before the \"surge\" campaign began in early 2007. The next April and May saw a sharp downturn in deaths across the board, the report found. The fighting in Basra and Baghdad was a major test for Iraqi troops. Military officials said the Iraqi operation in Basra initially looked like a failure, but has turned out to be a success as Iraqi troops continue to hold and stabilize the southern city. In ongoing operations in the northern city of Mosul to drive out al Qaeda, Iraqi forces are showing clear signs of independent operational capability with little to no U.S. help, U.S. military officials said. The report suggested those successes are bolstering the ranks: More than 27,000 Iraqis have joined the country's security forces since the last Pentagon report, in March, bringing the total number of Iraqi soldiers and police to about 560,000. Since the March report, the Iraqi government focused on resolving conflicts from Basra and Sadr City that dominated the political and security landscape over the past three months, the report said. The report also said increasing oil export revenues are putting more money into the country for development, reconciliation programs and security. Insurgents continue to strike, however. An attack by a female suicide bomber Sunday in Baquba, which killed a reported 15 people, is one example of instability in regions with a heavy insurgent presence. While death tolls are down, the report highlighted the negative influence Iran is having inside Iraq. The report said Iraq's neighbor \"continues to fund, train, arm and guide\" anti-American \"special groups,\" the U.S. term for splinter factions of al-Sadr's Mehdi Army and other Shiite militants. Iran has denied U.S. allegations it is supporting insurgent factions within Iraq. But U.S. and Iraqi troops have discovered Iranian weapons inside Iraq, including Iranian made roadside bombs -- and during the fighting in Basra, large stashes of Iranian-made weapons were found with manufacture dates on them as recent as this year, according to U.S. military officials. The report said the Iraqi government continues to press the Iranians, who deny blame. May 2008 marked a sharp drop in high-profile attacks from al Qaeda, according to the report. Attacks in May hit a two-year low, about 70 percent lower than the peak in March 2007. The U.S. military said the drop is connected to U.S. and Iraqi operations directed at al Qaeda, but pointed out that in a single day -- April 15 -- a high-profile attack killed more than 150 people.\n### Response: ", "target": "Pentagon's quarterly report to Congress notes violence reduction .\nIt also notes that jihadists loyal to al Qaeda in Iraq are still a threat .\nReport credits Sons of Iraq, former insurgents who are now being paid by U.S.\nIncreasing oil export revenues are putting more money into Iraq, report says .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.\n### Input:(Health.com) -- New FDA rules are helping ensure that we get the protection we pay for, and with skin cancer on the rise (one in five Americans will develop skin cancer in the course of a lifetime), these changes can't come soon enough. Key fixes: Sunscreens will be labeled \"water resistant\" (as opposed to waterproof or sweatproof); they can no longer be called \"sunblocks\" (as it overstates their effectiveness); and they can no longer claim to provide instant sun protection or to last more than two hours without reapplication. On top of that, sunscreens can be labeled \"broad spectrum\" only if they protect equally against UVB (the main culprit of skin cancer) and UVA rays, which cause aging. Unfortunately, the changes won't be on store shelves this summer. Last week the FDA announced it is giving manufacturers six additional months from their original deadline to meet the new requirements. And even with these changes, most of us still have questions. Here are the ones you sent to us, answered by our dermatologists. How much sunscreen do I really need to put on? Anytime you're planning to be outdoors, go with an SPF of at least 30 (45 for a little extra insurance) and put plenty on. The rule of thumb is 1 ounce (the size of a shot glass) on your body, and a teaspoon for your face, but derms advise being even more generous. Reapply every two hours -- more often if you're in and out of the water. Health.com: 7 ways you're aging your skin . Are there any sunscreens good for oily skin? Yes. What you want is an oil-free mineral block in an ultralight gel or liquid. \"Mineral sunscreens help mask redness, and because they reflect UV light, they help keep your skin surface cooler,\" Rodan notes. While you're at it, keep your skin clean by always washing your face after working up a sweat outdoors: Summer breakouts often have more to do with sweating than wearing sunscreen. How do I know if I'm spraying on enough sunscreen? I feel like it all blows away! Spray sunscreens aren't as powerful as lotions, so the trick is to look for one labeled \"continuous spray\" (no need to pump; it keeps spraying as long as your finger stays on the button) and apply two coats -- not one -- every hour, Rodan says. What should I look for in a sunscreen if I have sensitive skin? All the dermatologists we interviewed recommend mineral-based or physical sunscreens made with micronized titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide instead of chemical sunscreens because they're less likely to irritate sensitive skin. Plus, the latest mineral sunscreens give the gentle protection of a physical sunscreen without leaving a white cast.\r\rHealth.com: Short-and-sweet skin advice . Is sunscreen really necessary for lips? Absolutely. In the past, it wasn't unusual for lip products to come with little or no SPF. Thankfully, many companies have upped the level of protection in lip balms. That's critical because skin cancers on the lower lip, in particular, are especially aggressive. \"These cancers are dangerous, as they're more likely to spread,\" explains Jeremy Green, M.D., a Miami dermatologist. What's the easiest way to stay protected when I'm working out? Dab an SPF (of at least 30) stick or gel on your face, neck, and chest, and on hot spots like shoulders and the backs of your hands. \"The non-tacky sticks are great because they really stay put,\" says Washington, D.C.--based dermatologist Dr. Tina Alster. For the rest of your body, use a sunscreen spray. If you're swimming or perspiring a lot, opt for one of the new formulas that are marked \"water resistant\" for up to 40 or 80 minutes. Health.com: Fun-in-the-sun workout . I hate reapplying! Can I throw on a long-sleeved T-shirt instead at the beach? \"Most cotton shirts are no substitute for sunscreen,\" Rodan says. \"At best, they give you a UPF (ultraviolet protection factor, the equivalent of SPF for clothing) of 8 -- and if they get wet, that devolves to UPF 2.\" Instead, invest in a long-sleeved rash guard -- a type of shirt made up of a spandex and nylon mix that was originally used for water sports, but is now popular as a sun protector. Look for one with a UPF rating of 50+. \"Those things are lifesavers -- total protection, even when wet,\" Alster says. Likewise, your sun hat should be floppy, wide-brimmed, and made from a tightly woven material. Will my SPF foundation do the trick for workdays? \"You'd have to slap on a heck of a lot to make it truly effective,\" Green says. A better idea: Layer. Wash your face, swipe on a few drops of antioxidant serum to boost your protection, and apply a tinted moisturizer or foundation with SPF 15 or more. Top it with an ultra fine SPF mineral powder. Green recommends carrying the powder in your bag for touch-ups during the day -- especially if you're lunching alfresco.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- On the question of whether recent immigrants assimilate as quickly as previous waves, many Americans exhibit short fuses -- and even shorter memories. Ruben Navarrette Jr. notes that immigrants have been criticized throughout history for not assimilating. They have convinced themselves that, instead of adapting to the customs of this country, new arrivals -- most of whom come from Asia or Latin America -- expect the rest of us to accommodate them. They go ballistic over little things -- Mexican flags, taco trucks, libraries that offer bilingual story time, or having to \"press one for English.\" Yet, even as they look down on new immigrants, many Americans look back fondly upon their immigrant ancestors. Legend has it that when grandpa arrived from Ireland, Germany, Italy or Poland, he jumped off the boat, immediately draped himself in the American flag, ripped out his native tongue, and abandoned his culture -- all while singing \"Yankee Doodle Dandy.\" Germans did not move to Milwaukee and make beer and cheese. The Irish did not settle in Boston and join organizations like the Hibernian Society to preserve their heritage and culture. And even while Americans complain about how the current crop of immigrants aren't like their predecessors, they miss the irony: At the time, there were people who said the same thing about their ancestors; the Germans were thought to not be like the English, the Irish weren't like the Germans, the Italians weren't like the Irish etc. And the Chinese weren't like anyone who had come before them, and so they were labeled \"unassimilable\" by the Tom Tancredos of that era. Some things never change. When I was growing up in Central California, which is home to a large population of immigrants from Southeast Asia, thousands would gather to celebrate Hmong New Year. The local newspaper would do a feature. And, in the days that followed, someone would write an angry letter to the editor complaining that these people weren't melting into the pot. Yet, there is more melting going on than one might think, according to a new report from the Manhattan Institute. Billed as the first annual Index of Immigrant Assimilation, the study was written by Duke University Professor Jacob Vigdor. It measured three kinds of assimilation: economic (employment, education, homeownership, etc.); cultural (intermarriage, English proficiency, family size, etc.); and civic (citizenship, military service, political participation, etc.). Far from discovering that recent immigrants are ducking the assimilation process, the study found that \"immigrants of the past quarter-century have assimilated more rapidly than their counterparts of a century ago, even though they are more distinct from the native population upon arrival.\" Of course, individual groups still fall behind in some categories. Chinese and Indian immigrants have low levels of cultural assimilation. Mexican immigrants have low levels of economic assimilation. And Canadian and Indian immigrants have low levels of civic assimilation, since few of them become citizens. But, overall, the news is good. After more than 200 years, America still does an excellent job of assimilating immigrants. Even if a particular group tried to resist the process, they wouldn't stand a chance. Assimilation happens, whether the immigrants are ready or not. Those are the facts. Of course, fear doesn't listen to facts. That is something else that hasn't changed.

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?\n### Input: (CNN) -- African football's ruling body, the Confederation of African Football, has called for a thorough investigation into how 15 fans died at a league match in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The fatalities occurred after a stampede broke out in the closing stages of Sunday's decisive meeting between the country's biggest clubs, AS Vita Club and TP Mazembe. Reports state that trouble flared after fans of home side Vita started throwing missiles onto the pitch with their team trailing 1-0 in a game where the victor would take the title. The police responded by firing tear gas whereupon a stampede for the exit gates led to chaotic scenes of overcrowding, resulting in the deaths and injuries to over 20 others. On its website, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) said the stampede 'caused the collapse of a wall and a gate of the Tata Raphael stadium'. The match was taking place in the Congolese capital Kinshasa, at the stadium that staged the legendary 'Rumble in the Jungle' boxing bout between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in 1974. \"I wish to reemphasize that any acts of violence have no place in football,\" CAF President Issa Hayatou told cafonline.com. \"They must be condemned in the strongest possible terms and I urge FECOFA (the Congolese FA) and authorities in DR Congo to thoroughly investigate this matter and ensure that measures (are) put in place to avoid a repeat of any incidents.\" The long-serving Cameroonian also demanded that CAF be kept abreast of any proposed security measures. Kinshasa governor Andre Kimbuta has already set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the disaster. \"On behalf of FIFA and in my own name, I offer you, and the Congolese FA, my sincerest condolences,\" wrote FIFA President Sepp Blatter in a letter to the President of FECOFA. \"I would be most grateful if you would pass on the deep sympathy and support of the entire international football community to the families, loved ones and clubs of the deceased and victims at this very difficult time.\" \"May this message soften their pain and bring them support and comfort.\" At FIFA's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich, the flags of both DR Congo and CAF were flown at half-mast in a sign of mourning. The disaster is the worst at a Congolese football match since a game in Butembo in 2008, when 13 spectators -- many of whom were children -- died after police fired tear gas into the crowd shortly after stones had been thrown by the fans. Six years on, a similar set of circumstances has sparked a further devastating loss of life. The two teams are set to meet again on the weekend of May 24-25 in the group stages of the African Champions League. CAF is considering whether to play the match between AS Vita, crowned African champions in the 1970s, and four-time continental winners Mazembe behind closed doors. Mazembe stunned the footballing world in 2010 when becoming the first African side to reach the final of FIFA's Club World Cup, but their name may now conjure up far sadder emotions.\n### Response:", "target": "African football body CAF calls for 'thorough' investigation into DR Congo stadium disaster .\nFifteen fans died as a stampede broke out at the game between AS Vita and TP Mazembe .\nFIFA President Sepp Blatter offers support of the entire football community .\nMatch took place in stadium of 'Rumble in the Jungle' fame .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The video, just under a minute, was posted on 630WPRO.com. It depicts Kelly at the podium as audience members shout and interrupt him before he was to deliver a lecture. \"Racism is not for debate!\" one individual shouts in the video. When a university official asks the hecklers to hold their comments until the question-and-answer segment of the program, one protester loudly responds, \"We're asking that he stops stopping and frisking people!\" A federal judge ruled in August that the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy be altered, finding that it violated the Constitution in part by unlawfully targeting blacks and Latinos. The city of New York has since filed for appeal. \"Shut him down!\" another activist yells in the video. Kelly remains at the podium during the ordeal but does not respond to any of the comments in the footage, which cuts off before he leaves the stage. After nearly 30 minutes of disruption by activist students and members of the community, school officials made the decision to close the lecture and clear the auditorium, according to a statement from Brown University, which is in Providence, Rhode Island. \"Loud shouting, persistent interruption and coordinated chants made it impossible for the lecture to take place,\" the statement said. \"The actions that led to the closing of this afternoon's lecture prevented any exchange of ideas and deprived the campus and the Providence community of an opportunity to hear and discuss important social issues,\" said Brown University President Christina H. Paxson. \"The conduct of disruptive members of the audience is indefensible and an affront both to civil democratic society and to the university's core values of dialog and the free exchange of views,\" Paxson said in the statement.

Only heads of state were allowed inside the ceremony. An argument erupted when Ugandan authorities attempted to escort Gadhafi through the entrance. \"It escalated into a physical fight, but no guns were drawn,\" Ntale said. On Monday, a similar situation occurred when Gadhafi and his security team were walking to the main conference hall. Heads of state were being moved to another room, and a scuffle broke out when Ugandan authorities attempted to escort Gadhafi there.

As well as flagship fashion outlets, the area boasts one of the city's best department stores, Mitsukoshi (4-6-16 Chuo Dori). The real treat here, as at many Tokyo department stores, is the fantastic basement-level food hall (\"depachika\"). For the complete Mitsukoshi experience, there's an ever bigger store in Nihombashi. The \"Electric Town\" of Akihabara is tech-head's heaven. Next door is Matsuya, another big department store, and while you're in the area don't miss the Sony Building (5-3-1 Ginza, Chuo-ku). Your inner games geek won't be able to resist the entire floor devoted to the PlayStation. If you've ever wondered where Tokyo teenagers buy their wacky cyber-goth manga-inspired attire, the answer is Takeshita-Dori, a narrow street in Harajuku. On Sundays the street fills with fashion-conscious teens, dressed to impress. For the less adventurous, but more discerning shopper, Harajuku's main thoroughfare, Omotesando is lined with elegant boutiques, including Louis Vuitton, Prada and Loveless (3-17-11 Minami-Aoyama). Looking unlike any shop you've seen before, Loveless has three floors of hip Japanese clothing and a basement decked out like the dungeon of some deranged medieval aristocrat. Harajuku is also home to six-floor Kiddy Land (6-1-9 Jingu-mae), one of the city's best toy stores, with a huge selection of Hello Kitty products. The area around Shibuya Station is a buzzing epicenter of shopping activity. Among its highlights are Tokyu Hands (Takashimaya Times Square, 5-24-2 Sendagaya), a department store that sells everything you could ever need, and plenty of stuff you had no idea even existed (electrically heated pilllows anyone?). A Bathing Ape (1 - Rise Bld. 13-17 Udagawa-Cho) offers funky T-shirts and trainers in an art gallery-style space, and Mandarake (Shibuya Beam B2 31-2 Udagawacho) is the place to satisfy your manga cravings, should you have any. For more manga, and a glimpse into the future, you'll want to go to Akihabara. Also known as Electric Town, Akihabara is a district of electronics stores clad in illuminated signs. Visit after dark for the full \"Blade Runner\" experience. Yodobashi Camera sells everything from next generation cell phones to cameras that aren't yet available outside Japan. For something more sedate, Daikanyama is a refined area popular with in-the-know fashionistas, while Jimbocho is the city's used-book quarter. Marunouchi was once a drab business district but is fast becoming the city's hottest shopping area. Shin-Marunouchi (just opposite the Marunouchi exit of Tokyo Stations) is a huge building, with the lowest seven floors devoted to chic shopping. The basement \"depachika\" is a feast for foodies. Tokyo International Forum (5-1 Marunouchi 3-chome, Chiyoda-ku) is a vast space used for art exhibitions and as a concert hall.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?\n### Input: (CNN) -- The Year of the Gamer. Does 2013 actually deserve that title? Among video-game enthusiasts, the year was nearly consumed by the official announcement, subsequent speculation about, and ultimate release of Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One home consoles. Controversy and questions from gamers followed each long-awaited console until their arrival in homes began in November. Both clearly sparked lots of interest. Sony is reporting 2.1 million in global PS4 sales, while Microsoft says it's sold more than 2 million Xbox Ones. Both are poised to hit large, but slightly different audiences. Sony is going after the hardcore, dedicated gamer while Microsoft is positioning their device as an entertainment hub for the whole family. Either way, both are expected to do very well and create a huge demand for games and other content well into 2014. Nintendo, who led the next-generation charge in 2012 with the Wii U, spent much of the year concentrating on developing games for their new console. Battling a soft reception for the Wii U, the company released a wide range of games for hardcore players as well as casual, family-friendly titles, including a return of the always-popular Mario in the new \"Super Mario 3D World.\" Their handheld console, the Nintendo 3DS, continued to be a boon for the company. It's regularly the company's best-selling platform, and the release of \"Pokemon X/Y\" for the device ushered in a new chapter in the long-running franchise. They also added to their handheld stable with the Nintendo 2DS, a portable console designed for children. More durable and without the 3D effect, the 2DS was developed for the rough-and-tumble life of a kid. They weren't the only ones with a new entry in the portable market. The Nvidia Shield, released in July, tries bridge PC gaming and portable gaming. It can be used as a PC game controller, uses an Android-based mobile platform and has access to the Google Play store as well as Nvidia's own TegraZone. Technology advancements are creating more detailed, more responsive, and better quality games for the mobile gaming audience. A new iPhone 64-bit processing chip released in September had developers saying phone games are getting closer to console quality. And analysts are bullish on the future of mobile gaming, predicting revenues to reach $13.2 billion by the end of 2013 and nearly double in the next two year. Established PC and console game makers (Firaxis and UbiSoft to name just two) pushed into the mobile market aggressively in 2013, making games for the casual as well as the dedicated gamer. Mobile games weren't the only winners in 2013. The massive release of Grand Theft Auto V helped propel consumer spending on gaming to $3.45 billion in the third quarter of the year, the best quarter since 2011, according to The NPD Group. However, it wasn't all peaches and cream for the gaming industry in 2013. Despite a flood of money to some titles, some big-name game companies found themselves on the outside. THQ, a company that created the very popular \"Saints Row\" series and held the WWE license, finally broke apart in February with many of its properties being bought up by other companies. Zynga, a major powerhouse in social platform gaming, began shutting down some games, laying off personnel, closing offices and reported losing nearly half its user base from the previous year. Despite the hiring of former Microsoft executive Don Mattrick as Zynga's new CEO, many top executives also left the company. The landscape of gaming is definitely in flux. The development of new technology is expanding the reach of quality games to more players. Female gamers and parents playing with their kids are growing in numbers and game makers are working on games to reflect that more diverse audience. And with the expansion of the audience comes greater acceptance of the gaming experience in our culture. So if you think 2013 was the Year of the Gamer, just wait until 2014.\n### Response :", "target": "Release of Xbox One, PlayStation 4 topped 2013 gaming news .\nBoth consoles have sold millions, aiming for slightly different buyers .\nMobile gaming advanced with new iPhone chip .\nSocial gaming giant Zynga continued to tank in 2013 .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction :Can you give me a quick rundown?(CNN) -- Danish authorities said Tuesday they have arrested three people who allegedly were plotting a \"terror-related assassination\" of a cartoonist whose drawing of the Prophet Mohammed sparked rage in the Muslim world two years ago. The cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed provoked widespread outrage in the Muslim world two years ago. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service said police arrested a 40-year-old Dane of Moroccan origin and two Tunisians. The Danish citizen is charged with a terrorism offense, the intelligence service said, and the Tunisians will be deported. Police have not yet released the names of the three. The operation took place in the Aarhus area of western Denmark at 4:30 a.m. local time following lengthy surveillance, the intelligence service said. The target of the plot, the intelligence service said, was the cartoonist for the Danish newspaper Morgenavisen Jullands-Posten, which first published the controversial drawings in September 2005. The paper identified the cartoonist as Kurt Westergaard.  Watch how threats have targeted cartoonists \u00bb . \"Not wanting to take any undue risks [the intelligence service] has decided to intervene at a very early stage in order to interrupt the planning and the actual assassination,\" the statement by Jakob Scharf, the agency's director general, said. \"Thus, this morning's operation must first and foremost be seen as a preventive measure where the aim has been to stop a crime from being committed.\" The uproar over the cartoons ignited after the Danish newspaper published caricatures of Islam's Prophet Mohammed. Some Muslims believe it is forbidden by the Quran to show an image of the prophet. Demonstrations erupted across the world in early 2006 after other newspapers reprinted the images months later as a matter of free speech. Some turned deadly. Many protesters directed their ire at Denmark, prompting the closure of several Danish embassies in predominantly Muslim countries, including Indonesia and Pakistan. Westergaard's cartoon depicted the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse. Westergaard said he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror. However, many in the Muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist. \"Of course I fear for my life after the Danish Security and Intelligence Service informed me of the concrete plans of certain people to kill me,\" Westergaard said in a statement posted on the newspaper's Web site. \"However, I have turned fear into anger and indignation. It has made me angry that a perfectly normal everyday activity which I used to do by the thousand was abused to set off such madness.\" CNN's Paula Newton said the arrests reinforced growing fears in Europe that radical Islam was trying to suppress free speech. \"More and more Europeans feel that Islam is a threat to their way of life,\" Newton said. A recent Gallup poll for the World Economic Forum showed a majority of Europeans believed relations between the West and the Muslim world were worsening. According to the poll this sentiment was strongest held among Danish. Westergaard remains under police protection and does not know whether it will continue. \"I could not possibly know for how long I have to live under police protection; I think, however, that the impact of the insane response to my cartoon will last for the rest of my life,\" he said. \"It is sad indeed, but it has become a fact of my life.\" Carsten Juste, the paper's editor-in-chief, said staffers have been \"deeply worried\" for several months. \"The arrests have hopefully thwarted the murder plans,\" he said on the newspaper's Web site.

Born and bred in Malawi, in southern Africa, Da Silva lost 14 family members, including her father and two brothers, to the disease. \"AIDS is like The Plague in Malawi,\" says Da Silva. According to UNAIDS, 14 percent of the country's adult population is infected with HIV and more than half a million children have been orphaned by the disease. \"Orphans [in Malawi] are very underprivileged -- the grandparents are trying to raise them, with no money, no food, no clothes,\" she says. \"Just poverty.\" But from halfway around the world, as a nanny in Los Angeles, California, Da Silva provides a place where the orphans can get away from that -- The Jacaranda School.  Watch Da Silva talk about her school \u00bb . In 2002, Da Silva learned that the school in her southern Africa home town was going to close. Consumed with concern for the students, she urged her mother to let them gather and learn in their family home, with her financial support. \"All the while I was doing my best for the kids here -- making sure they're doing their homework, eating well,\" she remembers. \"I couldn't sleep just thinking about the children that need the same thing back in Malawi,\" says Da Silva. Thanks to Da Silva's passion, the school is now thriving in her childhood home and more than 200 children, most of whom are AIDS orphans, receive porridge every morning and education, free of charge. It is an effort that Da Silva funds almost entirely herself, sending $1,000, about one-third of her monthly paycheck, to pay the salaries of 12 teachers and the headmaster, and purchase whatever supplies she can afford. Several of her fellow nannies have even gotten involved, donating $10 a month to her foundation. Get involved: Jacaranda Foundation . While the classes are crowded and resources are few (there are only 15 books in the library, according to Da Silva), her efforts are working. \"We have kids studying in our family living room, kitchen, gazebo, you name it.

{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.\n### Input:Washington (CNN) -- As many as 2,000 additional troops -- including a number of U.S. forces -- may be headed to Afghanistan in the coming weeks under a plan backed by Gen. David Petraeus, CNN has learned. Petraeus has not commented publicly on the need for more troops, but a U.S. defense official and a senior NATO official directly familiar with his thinking and the entire matter have confirmed details to CNN. The proposal for more troops has been briefed to NATO officials behind closed doors. According to the NATO source, it calls for an additional 2,000 troops including at least 750 personnel to serve as trainers for Afghan forces. The trainers specifically would work to teach Afghan units how to support their operations in the field. The balance of the forces would work largely to counter the still significant threat posed by improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Another NATO official tells CNN \"it's highly likely\" many of the additional forces will be U.S. troops. Some NATO member countries are politically ambivalent about the war, he noted. And practically, it is only U.S. forces that have the most advanced equipment to counter roadside bombs . In May, Defense Secretary Robert Gates sent 850 U.S. military trainers on a temporary deployment when European countries could not pledge enough of their own forces. This latest need for 2,000 forces goes beyond that to include counter-IED forces, although some small number of the at least 750 additional trainers could replace those already there. No final decisions have been made on any additional U.S. troops. NATO military authorities are scheduled to meet in the coming days to try to get specific troop commitments from member nations. The goal is to get the matter resolved before a November NATO summit in which U.S. and NATO military commanders are expected to discuss progress in the war. It is not clear whether the new effort will bring the troop levels above the 30,000 additional U.S. forces authorized by President Barack Obama earlier this year, as it will depend on how many troops the NATO countries contribute and the potential re-assignment of existing forces. The president also authorized the Pentagon at the time to deploy 3,000 forces, but more than half of those 3,000 have already been earmarked. NATO sources emphasize they believe the bulk of the additional 2,000 will likely have to come from the US. The potential for yet another troop increase, even a relatively small one, is already being defended by NATO. The senior official told CNN \"this relatively small uplift -- less than 2 percent of the 150,000 in theatre from the coalition -- reflects the direction of the campaign: training the Afghan security forces to prepare for transition, as well as protecting our forces.\" A U.S. military official also confirms that in recent weeks the discussion of the \"withdrawal\" of forces from certain areas of Afghanistan beginning in July 2011 has taken a bit of a twist. The official said the withdrawal in some areas will signify that those areas may be turned over to Afghan control, but that may not mean troops will come home. The latest options call for taking those troops not needed and sending them to other areas where security is still poor.\n### Response :", "target": "Sources say new troops would include more trainers for Afghan forces .\nNATO official: \"It's highly likely\" many of the additional forces would be U.S. troops .\nNATO authorities will meet soon to get specific commitments from member nations .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Read the following passage and summarize it.JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Heavy rains smashed through a dam near Indonesia's capital Friday, unleashing a torrent of water that plowed into hundreds of homes and killed at least 52 people in what some survivors described as a suburban \"tsunami.\" Members of a search and rescue team look for bodies around upended trees and vehicles near  Jakarta Friday. Sleeping residents were taken by surprise by the powerful flash flood as it crashed through Jakarta's crowded Cirendeu suburb, in the early hours of the morning. Rescue crews suspended their search for survivors overnight Friday evening, the National Disaster Coordination Agency said. The agency put the death toll at 52 with 17 missing. It said 33 people were injured and 1,490 left homeless. The Indonesian Health Ministry put the death toll higher at 58 people. After the deluge, drenched, injured and shivering survivors took refuge on the rooftops of their homes as rescuers in rubber boats struggled to reach them. Social affairs spokesman official Mardjito, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, said relief efforts were being hampered by debris from the dam. \"We're still trying to get into the houses, but the problem is, mud is getting in our way,\" he said. Pictures from the scene showed the pulverized ruins of wooden buildings emerging as brown muddied waters subside.  Watch scenes of the flood devastation \u00bb . Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, currently on the campaign trail ahead of elections later this year, said he had ordered senior ministers to visit the scene of the disaster. \"On behalf of the government, I express my condolences to the families of the dead victims and may their souls be accepted by God almighty,\" he said, according to the official Antara news agency. The rain obliterated a 255-meter-long section of the dam at around 4 am local time, releasing a wall of water from the 20-hectare lake that some survivors said reminded them of the tsunami that hit Indonesia in 2004. \"They said they had heard loud rumbling sounds like during a powerful earthquake. They later found out that the sounds came from the water rushing out from the dam's lake,\" Antara said. Survivors told stories of dead relatives and harrowing brushes with death as they struggled to escape rising waters. Dewi Masitoh, a 40-year-old housewife, told the AFP news agency that she escaped with her husband and two daughters after they saw rising water reach the door of their stilt house. \"We were on the second floor but my daughter went back downstairs when the window broke and water gushed in. My husband jumped in and pulled her out of the water by her neck. \"I punched a hole through the roof and we all climbed up through,\" she said, showing cuts and scratches on her arms.\" Floods from heavy rains are an annual occurrence around Jakarta, a low lying city on the northern coast of Java island, where poor infrastructure often results in polluted canals and rivers spilling their banks and spilling into thousands of homes. In 2007, 38 people were killed and 430,000 forced from their homes when storm waters three meters deep in some places swamped 75 percent of the capital, which is home to about 9 million people. With poor sanitation and a hot and humid climate, the risk of water-borne diseases is usually a major concern following floods in the city, where mosquito-transmitted malaria is also a threat.

(Associated Press) \n  \n Detective Chad Winn, speaking during a preliminary hearing in Warren County District Court, said Kathy Michelle Coy told 21-year old Jamie Stice they were going shopping for baby supplies but took her instead to a wooded area with plans to kill her. \n  \n Coy, 33, has been charged with murder and kidnapping of a minor. \n  \n Winn testified that after attacking Stice with the stun gun, Coy slit Stice's throat and wrists, then cut the baby out of her abdomen. Winn said Coy eventually led investigators to Stice's body and gave details of the slaying. \n  \n \"She advised that she stunned her, her throat was slit, her wrists were slit, she was disemboweled,\" Winn said as members of Stice's family fled the courtroom in tears. \"The baby was obviously cut out of her.\" \n  \n Stice's remains were found off a dirt road in the Oakland community of southern Kentucky on April 14, less than a day after she was last seen leaving her home with Coy. Coy was arrested after showing up at a Bowling Green hospital with a newborn baby, but no signs of having given birth, Winn said. \n  \n Warren County District Judge Sam Potter sent the case to the grand jury. Coy's public defender, Jim Gibson, objected to the preliminary hearing, saying Coy's competency and mental state were uncertain. \n  \n \"The defense is concerned that there are significant mental health issues,\" Gibson said. \n  \n Warren County Commonwealth's Attorney Chris Cohron said he may seek the death penalty for Coy, but will make that decision after any mental health issues are litigated. Cohron said the case will be presented to a grand jury within two months. \n  \n James Reynolds, the baby's father, says the infant is in good condition and that his name is Isaiah. He declined further comment. \n  \n Winn was the only witness to testify during the 30-minute hearing. About 50 spectators, some wearing red, white and blue ribbons with the names \"Jamie\" and \"Isaiah\" on them, packed into the crowded courtroom. \n  \n Coy, who has a hearing impairment, did not appear to look at or acknowledge Stice's family, but did cry before the hearing. \n  \n Winn said there is evidence that Coy, who claimed to have had a miscarriage, planned to kill a pregnant woman and steal a baby. Winn said Coy approached her 13-year-old daughter in early April about taking part in such a plot. When the daughter balked, Coy passed it off as a joke, Winn said. \n  \n Soon after, Coy approached her 14-year-old son and asked if he would take part in a murder, Winn said. The son refused and Coy didn't bring it up again, the detective testified. \n  \n After killing Stice and stealing the baby boy, Coy drove to the home of a friend and said she had given birth to the baby, Winn said. The friend told troopers that Coy was in a car, wearing no pants and sitting on the placenta while holding the baby, who had grass on him, Winn said. \n  \n The friend called for an ambulance after helping to clean the baby and taking a picture of the newborn, Winn said. At the hospital, at about 5:50 p.m. CDT on April 13, Coy brought in a uterus, ovaries and placenta with umbilical cord still attached, along with the baby, Winn said. \n  \n At the hospital, Dr. Sara Mangold examined Coy and determined she didn't give birth to the baby, Winn said. \n  \n \"She showed no signs whatsoever of having a child,\" Winn said. \n  \n After seeing the internal organs Coy presented to doctors, hospital staff suspected someone had been killed and called police, Winn said. \n  \n \"There may have been a small chance that someone was still alive, but not likely,\" Winn said. \n  \n Coy initially insisted she gave birth to the boy, then told police she bought the baby for $550 from a woman named \"Ashley,\" but provided few details, Winn said. \n  \n Police searched Coy's home and computer, finding links to two pregnant women on her Facebook page, Winn said. Investigators found one of the women unharmed, but couldn't find Stice, Winn said. Police would later find a stun gun and two knives believed to be used in the attack, Winn said. \n  \n \"I then asked Ms. Coy if that baby was Jamie Stice's,\" Winn said. \"She answered 'I don't know.' I was alarmed by this.\" \n  \n Coy eventually led detectives to a wooded area off a dirt road, where Stice's remains were located, Winn said. \n  \n \"We could have never found the body if Ms. Coy didn't tell us where it was,\" Winn said. |||||\n### Response :", "target": "\u2013 A Kentucky woman was charged with kidnapping and murder after turning up at a hospital with a newborn boy she claimed was hers.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?(CNN) -- The FBI said Monday night that a Tennessee mother and her 14-year-old daughter are dead, though the man they believe abducted them -- along with two other daughters -- remains at large. Authorities previously reported that they had found two bodies Friday at a Guntown, Mississippi, residence tied to the kidnapping suspect, Adam Mayes. But it was not until Monday that the Shelby County, Tennessee, medical examiner positively identified the pair as Jo Ann Bain, 31, and her daughter Adrienne Bain, according to the FBI. Mayes is considered armed and dangerous, with authorities asking for the public's help in tracking down him and the two other girls, 12-year-old Alexandria Bain and 8-year-old Kyliyah Bain, whom he also allegedly abducted. Authorities established contact with and tried to interview the 35-year-old Mayes soon after the mother and her three daughters were reported missing on April 27 by Jo Ann's husband from Whiteville, a western Tennessee town of 4,600 people, but then he fled, Joel Siskovic, the spokesman for the FBI bureau in Memphis, Tennessee, told CNN affiliate WPTY. He was last seen May 1 in Guntown, the same northern Mississippi town where the bodies were found. Details haven't been released as to how or exactly when they died. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation late last week issued an Amber Alert asking for the public's help in finding the Bain sisters and for information leading to Mayes' arrest. Aaron T. Ford, special agent in charge at the FBI's Memphis bureau, told CNN on Sunday that investigators believe all the kidnapping victims \"were transported across state lines into Mississippi.\" Local, state and federal law enforcement's focus is now in Union County, Mississippi, where Guntown is located, the FBI agent said. Authorities have also pointed out, however, that Mayes has connections to Texas, North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida and could be en route to Arizona. Mayes may be using the alias of Christopher Zachery Wylde or Paco Rodrigass, his Facebook profile name, the FBI said Monday. Rick Foster, whose wife was a lifelong friend of Jo Ann Bain and whose daughter was a classmate of Adrienne Bain, recently told CNN that Mayes had been a friend of the Bain family for years. Mayes lived about 90 miles away in Mississippi, Foster said, but would stay with the Bains when he was in the Whiteville area. He described Mayes as \"a big kid in a grown man's body.\" Mary Patterson, Mayes' landlord in Alpine, Mississippi, told WPTY that she thought he was a \"kind\" and \"fun guy.\" \"If somebody told me this, I would have never believed it,\" she said. Authorities characterize Mayes as a white man who has blue eyes and brown hair, weighs about 175 pounds and stands 6-foot-3. He recently cut his own hair and may have done the same to the three children, according to the Amber Alert. As for the Bains, Foster described the marriage between Jo Ann and her husband, Gary, as \"perfect\" and said the family had planned to move to Arizona once the school year ends. The FBI and U.S. Marshals Service are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Mayes' arrest and to the missing girls.

The act forbids discrimination against individuals with disabilities in a range of areas like employment, access to public facilities, transportation and telecommunications. Over the last 20 years, sidewalk ramps have been installed and accessibility to most public places has been improved. Yet, vehicles largely have been ignored. But that's about to change. Vehicle Production Group, a Miami, Florida-based company plans to start production of the MV-1, which stands for first mobility vehicle, at a plant in Mishawaka, Indiana, late this year. \"This is the first vehicle that's been built from the ground up for wheelchair accessibility and the only vehicle that's factory-produced that meets the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act,\" according to Dave Schembri, the CEO for Vehicle Production Group. Schembri said there are 54 million Americans who have some kind of of disability, with 4 million of them being wheelchair dependent. Those needing wheelchair accessibility typically have to convert a new or used vehicle, including the addition of a ramp, which Schembri says compromises vehicle's structural integrity. That, he said, negates the safety ratings of the vehicle and negates the factory warranty as it pertains to those modifications. \"Our vehicle, you drive up the ramp, and you turn right and immediately you're sitting in the prime seat of the vehicle which is shotgun next to the driver,\" Schembri said. During a test drive, Schembri said he took a friend of his, who is a member of the New York Knicks wheelchair basketball team, out to lunch. \"He's sitting there having a sandwich and his coke and he says 'I'm sitting in the front seat using a cup holder looking out the front window of this car. And I can't even remember the last time I did that,'\" Schembri said. Smaller than your typical passenger van converted to handle wheelchairs, the MV-1 will be rated as a car, standing about five-feet tall. The 36-inch door opening and access ramp complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act, while fitting nearly every size wheelchair. Schembri said he expects the MV-1 to start below $40,000, noting the company has received 4,000 reservations.\n### Response :", "target": "The new vehicle is made for wheelchair-bound passengers .\nThe MV-1 is made \"from the ground up\" for people with disabilities .\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act was passed in 1990 .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

She thought about how it could be used. She considered cutting the man who was holding her hostage, a relative, so she could escape from his physical and sexual abuse. She also weighed whether to kill herself. But in the end, the woman decided that trying to get away wouldn't work, so she tossed the blade. The abuse continued. Those and other allegations were lodged in a complaint against Timothy Jay Vafeades, 53, who was charged Monday in Clay County, Minnesota, with kidnapping, false imprisonment and domestic abuse. Vafeades, a trucker, was arrested there last week after a routine scale inspection turned up that he had an active protection order against him and that the 19-year-old woman -- his passenger -- was the protected party. The inspection also determined there was an active warrant for him out of Sarasota County, Florida. More than six months earlier, the woman had left Sarasota to join Vafeades with the understanding that she could help with his trucking business, earn up to $10,000 and return home, the complaint says. He paid for her plane ticket out to Salt Lake City, Utah. That first night, she allegedly woke up to find Vafeades under the blankets on her bed, performing a sex act. She was scared and stunned and said she didn't want a sexual relationship with her relative, the complaint says. Vafeades allegedly told her that he had no intention of allowing her to leave or go back to Florida. He took her driver's license and Social Security card. The woman told investigators that she then started to accompany Vafeades on deliveries throughout the United States. The truck had a single bed, and they slept in it together. She and Vafeades had sex every two to three days, the complaint says. It goes on to describe several strange and controlling behaviors. Vafeades allegedly did not let the woman use public restrooms at rest stops or truck stops, nor did he allow her to take showers alone at truck stops. He also did not allow her to be alone or walk around truck stops by herself. They were required to hold hands. If he so much as thought she made eye contact with someone, he would yell and hit her back at the truck, the complaint says. The woman estimated Vafeades had hit her between 20 and 30 times. When he was arrested, the woman had a black eye, which she told investigators Vafeades had given her. He wore bracelets that he referred to as his \"slave bracelets,\" the complaint says. He would use those to hit her. Vafeades allegedly told the woman he was capable of killing her, and she believed he could. The woman sometimes referred to Vafeades as the \"Dentist,\" as he had several pairs of false teeth and an apparent obsession with vampires. He had one set of dentures made to look like vampire teeth and had ordered a set of false teeth for the woman, the complaint says. He also allegedly filed down certain teeth in her mouth. \"It's definitely very unique circumstances and definitely very predatory behavior,\" said Clay County prosecutor Brian Melton. Vafeades' attorney, Rex Tucker, declined to comment Tuesday. CNN was not immediately able to determine whether Vafeades had an opportunity to enter a plea. According to Melton, bond in the case was set at $1 million.

A decade of research carried out by scientists for the WWF in remote mountain areas brought discoveries such as a bright green frog that uses its red and long webbed feet to glide in the air. The WWF report, \"The Eastern Himalayas -- Where Worlds Collide,\" details discoveries made by scientists from various organizations between 1998 and 2008 in a region reaching across Bhutan and northeast India to the far north of Myanmar as well as Nepal and southern parts of Tibet in China. \"The good news of this explosion in species discoveries is tempered by the increasing threats to the Himalayas' cultural and biological diversity,\" Jon Miceler, Director of WWF's Eastern Himalayas Program, said in a press statement. \"This rugged and remarkable landscape is already seeing direct, measurable impacts from climate change and risks being lost forever.\" The report describes more than 350 new species discovered, including 244 plants, 16 amphibians, 16 reptiles, 14 fish, two birds, two mammals and at least 60 new invertebrates. One of the most significant findings was not exactly \"new\" in the classic sense. A 100-million year-old gecko, the oldest fossil gecko species known to science, was discovered in an amber mine in the Hukawng Valley in the northern Myanmar. The report mentions the miniature muntjac, also called the \"leaf deer,\" which is the world's oldest and smallest deer species. Scientists initially believed the small creature found in the world's largest mountain range was a juvenile of another species but DNA tests confirmed it was a new species. The Eastern Himalayas harbor a staggering 10,000 plant species, 300 mammal species, 977 bird species, 176 reptiles, 105 amphibians and 269 types of freshwater fish. The region also has the highest density of Bengal tigers in the world and is the last bastion of the charismatic greater one-horned rhino. Historically, the rugged and largely inaccessible landscape of the Eastern Himalayas has made biological surveys in the region extremely difficult.

Hailing from the impoverished slum of Gatina on the western outskirts of Nairobi, the 23-year-old's daily tasks include running a delivery service company, owning a barbershop and selling energy efficient stoves -- all the while putting himself through university. Makokha's typical day starts when everyone else is still deep in their sleep. By 3am, he's already up, studying and preparing his school assignments for later in the evening; by 7am, he enters the green doors of \"Clean Touch,\" the barbershop he set up three years ago at the heart of his local community. By 8am, he leaves the shop to an employee to start running his SkyHighSwiss courier service -- jumping on his motorbike, Makokha spends most of his day making personal deliveries all across the bustling Kenyan capital, whilst checking every now and then his Facebook page for any orders for his latest business venture: selling EcoZoom clean burning cook stoves. By 4.30pm, Makokha parks his motorbike, only to head to the Maasai Mara University where he is a first-year student of community development. Lectures last from 5.30pm to 8.30pm and by 10pm he's usually at bed -- only to wake up at 3am again the next day to do it all over again. Exhausting, no? \"It's a matter of determination and being focused,\" explains the enterprising businessman. \"It's only the passion that I have to work in the community,\" he adds, when asked how he juggles time to manage it all. Risk-taker . Growing up in Gatina, Makokha became a multitasking entrepreneur out of necessity to pull himself out of poverty. One of the biggest challenges, he says, was feeling alone. \"We youth in the slums are not supported,\" says Makokha. \"So you have to struggle with everything,\" he continues. \"You don't have a mentor, you have no place to run for help -- that is what is making me work every day very hard.\" Read more from inspiring African entrepreneurs . Makokha says he always wanted \"to become an entrepreneur and a risk-taker.\" Determined to make it, he started \"Clean Touch\" to earn money by shaving his clients and allowing them to charge their phones. Then, about a year ago he got a driver's license and launched SkyHighSwiss. \"The courier is different than the barbershop,\" says Makokha, who employs one staff member for each business. \"Because the barber I target the people I live around with and the courier I target people outside because they are busy,\" he adds. \"It's people from the whole town, people who are much more richer, they don't have time to do shopping or run for errands -- I took advantage of their busyness to make my business, so I deliver parcels, I deliver food, I deliver drinks.\" 'I want to inspire' Thanks to his hard work and determination, Makokha can now afford to pay for his own living space and also attend university. But the self-made entrepreneur wants to better the lives of people in his community too. On weekends, he spends most of his time with children in Gatina, putting his community development skills into practice by mentoring young people and helping them put on theater performances. \"After my studies I want to start a project to help people where I am living,\" says the spirited entrepreneur. \"To identify their needs, to realize their potential and help them achieve their goals,\" he continues . \"My biggest dream in this world is to have a social business enterprise to help fight the poverty level -- I want to inspire young people like me.\" READ THIS: Luxury shoes put sparkle in your step .

{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given text.\n### Input:Apple has apparently further cut Google out of its universe. While a standalone YouTube app is on its way, it won't be installed by default on new iPhones and iPads. \n  \n (Credit: Google) \n  \n Apple dropped the default YouTube app from the latest beta version of iOS 6, sparking rumblings of further anti-Google action following its expulsion of Google Maps earlier this year. The Cupertino company says the YouTube app will be back... but in standalone form, not as a home-screen default. \n  \n While YouTube is gone from the iPhone and the iPad, it was still working for Apple TV, 9to5Mac reported earlier today. The move appears to be Apple's latest attempt to distance itself from Google services. The company dropped Google Maps as a preset on its phone in favor of its own 3D Maps earlier this year. \n  \n YouTube was one of the original iPhone's main features, pushing Google to re-encode the entirety of the popular video hosting service's library so that it could work without Adobe's Flash. \n  \n Since then Apple, which is in charge of maintaining the app, has largely let it languish. The company did add a few features, mainly to the video player and social features like commenting and sharing on other social networks. Google, in turn, has put its resources into developing a mobile site to emulate some of that functionality. \n  \n This latest move from Apple won't necessarily crimp users' ability to catch lolcat videos on iPhones and iPads, since YouTube will still be available via Web browsers such as Apple's Safari. \n  \n  \n  \n Apple released the following statement: \n  \n Our licensing to include the YouTube app in iOS has ended. Customers can use YouTube in the Safari browser and Google is working on a new YouTube app to be in the App Store. \n  \n An Apple spokeswoman confirmed that the company will not preinstall the YouTube app in iOS 6 at all. Instead, interested users will have to search it out in Apple's App Store. \n  \n YouTube would not confirm if there is a new app on the way. \n  \n \"We are working with Apple to ensure we have the best possible YouTube experience for iOS users,\" a company spokesman said in a statement e-emailed to CNET. \n  \n Updated at 3:11 p.m. PT: With comment from YouTube. ||||| Why Is Apple\u2019s YouTube App Disappearing? (Hint: Think Ads.) \n  \n So we know that Apple won\u2019t include its homegrown YouTube app in the newest version of the iPhone software that comes out this fall. \n  \n But why? That\u2019s a little murky right now. \n  \n I haven\u2019t heard back from Google yet. (Update: Here\u2019s a comment via a YouTube rep: \u201cWe are working with Apple to make sure we have the best possible YouTube experience for iOS users.\u201d) But here\u2019s what Apple PR rep Trudy Muller told my colleague John Paczkowski today, confirming reports that the YouTube app has disappeared in the newest beta version of the iOS6 app released to developers: \n  \n Our license to include the YouTube app in iOS has ended. Customers can use YouTube in the Safari browser and Google is working on a new YouTube app to be on the App Store. \n  \n But that\u2019s confusing. Just about anyone can build their own YouTube app, using YouTube\u2019s public API. So something\u2019s broken here: Either Apple really doesn\u2019t want to make its own version of a YouTube app, or Google really doesn\u2019t want Apple to make one. \n  \n Neither version of that story makes a lot of sense. YouTube was one of the original apps that Apple included with the very first iPhone, back in 2007, when the only apps on the machine were the ones Apple made. \n  \n The linkup was good for both sides. This ad even highlighted the integration: \n  \n Then again, that was back in 2007, when Eric Schmidt was on the Apple board of directors, and Google hadn\u2019t launched Android, and Steve Jobs wasn\u2019t talking about going \u201cthermonuclear.\u201d \n  \n And since then, of course, things have changed. The Apple/Google rift already surfaced earlier this year, when Apple confirmed plans to replace Google Maps on the iPhone with a homegrown version. \n  \n In the meantime, the iPhone YouTube app has always been a weird bit of corporate compromise. If you\u2019ve used the app, you might notice that it doesn\u2019t run ads, and that some YouTube content isn\u2019t available on it \u2014 most music videos, for instance. \n  \n If you want that stuff on your iPhone, you\u2019ll need Google-sanctioned versions, like the HTML Web app that Google launched in 2010, or the official Vevo app, which is powered by Google. And that\u2019s the only choice you\u2019ll have, starting this fall. \n  \n Update: Here\u2019s some insight from an industry executive who works with both companies, and suggests that you\u2019ll increasingly see YouTube take control of all its apps, for the reasons discussed above: Ad dollars and user experience. \u201cYouTube [has] decided they didn\u2019t want third-parties building apps,\u201d says my source. \u201cTheir strategy has changed. They want to control their destiny more.\u201d |||||\n### Response :", "target": "\u2013 Looking forward to iOS 6 on your iPhone?

But with their boats docked and their oyster leases pretty much useless, what did they have to work with? \n  \n \"As a joke, somebody yelled out, 'We got a lot of oil,'\" Voisin said Thursday. \n  \n About a week later, he said, it seemed less funny and more inspirational. \n  \n Voisin (pronounced VWAH' san) last month helped launch a nonprofit relief effort for seafood workers thrown out of work by the spill. And on its website, horizonrelief.org, is the result of the inspiration: thick blobs of oil from the Deepwater Horizon rig leak, scooped from Louisiana waters and poured into a glass bottle, sealed with a cork and wax. \n  \n The price: $1,000. \n  \n One thousand of them are being offered as a limited edition souvenir of the nation's worst environmental disaster, unleashed after the rig exploded and sank in April. Voisin thinks of the bottles as a work of art that philanthropists might actually shell out for. \n  \n Lesser donations also are being accepted for those unwilling or unable to afford $1,000-a-bottle oil. \n  \n Money raised will go to oyster shuckers, fishing boat deck hands, day laborers, and others who might not have the time or necessary proof of previous income to apply for help through the BP claims process or government aid programs. \n  \n Owners and managers of seafood companies know who the people are and can give the money without having to wait for applications or documentation, he said. \n  \n \"We don't need W2s. We don't need 1040s. We know the places that are shutting down. We know the community,\" Voisin said. \n  \n \"The obvious criticism is: What if you help someone who doesn't need it?

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 10 members of Pakistan's military were killed in a gun battle with Taliban militants at a naval base in the coastal city of Karachi, authorities said Monday. The clashes raged for hours after attackers with guns and grenades stormed the compound Sunday night. By Monday afternoon, the base had \"been cleared from the terrorists,\" a Pakistani navy spokesman said. In addition to the 10 dead, at least 15 other Pakistani troops were wounded in the fighting, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said. Investigators have found the bodies of three attackers and believe a fourth is buried in debris, he said. They suspect two militants escaped, he said, citing witness reports. The Pakistani Taliban said the attack at the Mehran naval air station was to avenge the killing of innocent civilians. The group's spokesman, Ihsan Ullah, told CNN on Monday that Pakistani security forces are carrying out those killings on the instruction of the United States in the name of a \"war on terror.\" One of the attackers had detonated a suicide jacket, Malik said, and another one was found wearing an undetonated jacket. \"We have daily 9/11 in this country. You see how we are suffering,\" he said. \"And therefore, this is my appeal to the international community ... trust us, trust us, because this is a time we need you to support us morally.\" Authorities said militants wielding rocket launchers, automatic weapons and hand grenades attacked the base about 11 p.m. Sunday. They used ladders to scale a wall at the back of the base and jumped into the compound, Malik said. Two witnesses -- Amjad Bashir and Talha Hashmi -- reported at least 10 explosions in the subsequent hours. Each blast was typically followed by a sustained exchange of gunfire, Hashmi said. He said that several of the explosions -- thought to be the result of two military aircraft and a fuel tank catching fire and releasing plumes of smoke -- were particularly large. The attackers destroyed two P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft sold by the United States to Pakistan, Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said. Six American contractors at the base during the attack moved to safety and were not injured, he said. The nation's military personnel responded with what an Malik called a \"major operation\" at the base, which is about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Karachi's main airport. According to the Pakistani navy's website, the Mehran base \"is efficiently supporting day and night operational activities of all (naval aviation) squadrons.\" A host of courses are also offered on its grounds, from helicopter and air navigation instruction to sea survival. The Pakistani Taliban represents a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based. The group, which is headquartered in Quetta, is separate from the Afghan Taliban, which has been focused on re-establishing the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan. Both groups swear allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar and have close ties to al Qaeda. Karachi, which is considered the main commercial hub of Pakistan, has seen a drastic increase in political, ethnic and religious violence in recent months. Just over three weeks ago, three people were killed and at least 20 were injured when a hand grenade exploded at a gambling club in the southern Pakistani city. The grenade was tossed into the club by one of two unidentified people riding past the facility on a motorbike, according to Javed Baloch, a senior police official in Karachi. The Taliban said it was behind an April 28 roadside bombing on a main road through Karachi that left at least five dead and 10 injured. Two days earlier, three were killed and more than 30 wounded when remote-controlled bombs detonated near two buses carrying Pakistani navy officials. CNN's Tim Schwarz, Stan Grant, Nasir Habib, Greg Botelho, Jack Maddox, Aliza Kassim and Charley Keyes contributed to this report.\n### Response: ", "target": "NEW: Pentagon spokesman: Two P-3C Orion aircraft are destroyed .\n\"We have daily 9/11 in this country,\" Pakistan's interior minister says .\nThe Pakistani navy says the base \"has been cleared from the terrorists\"\nA Taliban confederation says the attack is to avenge the killing of civilians by security forces .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction :What's the text mainly about?London (CNN) -- Royal watchers eagerly await the arrival of a child that will be heir to the British throne. Here's what you need to know and the latest developments: . \u2022 Queen Elizabeth II is among those keen for the new baby to greet the world. On a visit to northern England Wednesday, she was asked by a little girl whether she wants her great-grandchild to be a boy or a girl. The queen replied: \"I don't think I mind. I would very much like it to arrive. I'm going on holiday.\" \u2022 The Duchess of Cambridge is now overdue. A royal source tells CNN that her due date was July 13. She and Prince William announced at the start of the year that the baby was due in July, but did not announce the date. \u2022 Prince Charles' wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, said Monday that the family was on tenterhooks for the baby's arrival -- and suggested it could be very soon. \"We're all waiting at the end of a telephone,\" she said, in an exchange filmed by ITV. \"I hope by the end of the week, he or she will be there.\" \u2022 The baby will have the title His or Her Royal Highness Prince or Princess (the baby's name) of Cambridge, St. James's Palace said this month. However, it could be as long as 10 days before the baby's name is announced. \u2022 Speculation on what that name will be is rife -- and betting is going strong. Bookies' favorites include Alexandra, Elizabeth or Charlotte for a girl, and George or James for a boy. \u2022 Anyone born in Britain on the same day as William and Catherine's baby will receive a special coin from the Royal Mint: a silver penny, dated 2013, that will come in a blue pouch for a boy or a pink one for a girl. \u2022 Catherine is expected to give birth at the private Lindo wing of St. Mary's Hospital, next to Paddington Station in London. It's where William was born. Catherine's mother, Carole Middleton, is likely to be on hand at the hospital. \u2022 The first indication that the baby is on its way will be an announcement in the media that the duchess has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor, royal sources tell CNN. The next public announcement is expected to be that of the birth. It will be made in the form of a formal bulletin, signed by medical staff and rushed in a car with a police escort to Buckingham Palace. There, the notice will be placed in a gilt frame positioned on an easel -- the same one used to announce William's birth -- and placed in the palace forecourt for all to see. \u2022 The first to know about the royal baby will be Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister David Cameron and the governors general of each of the commonwealth nations, along with the rest of the royal and Middleton families. If the baby arrives in the middle of the night, it's unlikely the queen will be awoken, so there is a chance in that instance that an official announcement will not be made until the following morning. \u2022 Celebratory gun salutes will be sounded by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park (41 rounds) and the Honorable Artillery Company at the Tower of London (62 rounds) after the baby is born. \u2022 William and Catherine did not want to know the sex of their baby beforehand, royal sources say. There has been speculation it is a girl, however, especially after a member of the public said in March that the duchess almost uttered \"daughter\" while at a public event in Grimsby. The woman said the duchess was given a teddy bear and replied, \"Thank you, I will take that for my d--\" but then stopped herself. \u2022 The baby will be third in line to the throne after Prince Charles and Prince William, regardless of gender. A rule change in 2011 ended centuries of male primogeniture, which decreed that the crown passed to the eldest son and was bestowed on a daughter only when there were no sons. It means that if the next royal baby is a girl, she will eventually become queen; previously, a younger male sibling would have taken precedence. \u2022 The queen's cousin, Margaret Rhodes, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour she hoped the child would have a normal childhood. \"I imagine and hope that its early life, until it's at least in its teens, will be just a jolly, happy, ordinary child's life,\" she said. \u2022 It's not known where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to spend the days and weeks following the birth. William is expected to be given the usual paternity leave of two weeks by the Ministry of Defence, royal sources say. He will then return to his job as a helicopter search and rescue pilot. \u2022 The revelation that Catherine was pregnant came after she was admitted to a London hospital in December for acute morning sickness.\n### Response: ", "target": "NEW: The queen doesn't mind if the baby's a boy or a girl -- she just wants it to arrive soon .\nA royal source says Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, is overdue .\nShe is expected to give birth at the private Lindo wing of St. Mary's Hospital .\nBookies' favorite baby names include Alexandra, Elizabeth, Charlotte, George and James .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Produce an article summary of the following news article:Doc to summarize:NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- President George W. Bush called India's prime minister Thursday to push a proposed nuclear partnership that sparked an unsuccessful no-confidence vote against the Indian leader this week, a White House spokesman said. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh won a confidence vote despite opposition to the nuclear deal. \"Both leaders expressed their desire to see the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear issue move forward as expeditiously as possible,\" Gordon Johndroe said. The phone call took place two days after Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh narrowly survived the no-confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament. The vote was sparked by concerns from the opposition that India was kowtowing to the U.S. The tentative deal was announced in 2006 and signed by Bush and Singh a year ago. Under the agreement, which will need to be approved by the U.S. Congress, India would have access to U.S. nuclear fuel and technology for its civilian nuclear power plants. That would happen even though New Delhi, which tested nuclear weapons in 1974 and 1998, has declined to join international non-proliferation agreements. In return, India has promised that it would not transfer the fuel and equipment to its weapons program, and it would allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect at least 14 of its 22 nuclear plants. The plan would also expand U.S.-Indian cooperation in energy and satellite technology. The plan was approved by India's Cabinet last year, and does not have to be ratified by the parliament. The leaders of India's two communist parties -- which hold about 60 seats in Parliament -- have accused Singh of surrendering India's sovereignty to the United States with the deal. A no-confidence vote would have forced Singh to resign, and required the government to hold early elections unless a new coalition could have been formed. The Congress Party-led coalition has governed India since 2004. Tuesday's 275-256 vote was so crucial to the survival of Singh's government that five members of parliament serving prison sentences were freed to cast votes -- under the watchful eyes of their jailers. Shortly after Singh survived the vote, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino praised the deal as \"a good one for everybody.\" \"It's good for India because it would help provide them a source for energy that they need, one that is nonpolluting and one that doesn't emit greenhouse gas emissions,\" she said. \"And we think that we can move forward with this. If their legislature lets it move forward, then we can do the same here and then we'll be able to get this wrapped up.\"\n### Response :", "target": "President Bush calls India's PM to push a proposed nuclear partnership .\nIndian government won confidence vote in face of anger over U.S. nuclear deal .\nFive members of parliament serving prison sentences were freed to vote .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Syrian refugee Nassar and his family - he has five sons and five daughters, aged from three to 22 -- fled their home in Idlib as the country's bloody civil war took hold. Now, after almost three years of fear and uncertainty, they are on the move again, flying more than 12,000km from their temporary base in Lebanon to a more permanent home on the other side of the world. \"Returning to Syria is not an option,\" Nassar told CNN a day before he began the daunting 23-hour journey to Uruguay, where he and his children are being resettled at the invitation of the country's President Jose Mujica. \"I'm excited to go to Uruguay but I'm also nervous. I'm going because I want my kids to continue their education,\" he said. \"Traveling to the other side of the world to find a new chance to live, this is not easy,\" said Uruguay's Human Rights Secretary Javier Miranda, who accompanied the group, along with a CNN team. \"They are very brave to choose a new destiny for their lives because they want to educate their kids with dignity. They deserve our help and they deserve the opportunity.\" Uruguay has offered to take in up to 120 refugees to help with the humanitarian crisis sparked by the conflict in Syria. Nassar and his family are among the first 42 - five families -- to make the move. A second group is expected to follow by February 2015. Together, they will live at Hogar San Jose, a Catholic home on the outskirts of the capital, Montevideo, for two months, learning Spanish and adjusting to a new culture before moving on. First though, they have to get there. It's a lengthy and life-changing journey - from Beirut, via Frankfurt and Buenos Aires - and one filled with mixed emotions. After one final briefing from Pierre King, operations manager at the International Organization for Migration, which has organized the trip, and a last medical check-up, they are cleared to set off. For most of the refugees, it is their first time on a plane, so there is an air of excitement as well as of apprehension about what awaits them on arrival in Montevideo. Nassar's eldest sons, Mohammed and Bassel are keen to learn all they can about their soon-to-be-adopted home, peppering me with questions when we first meet. \"What is life like there?\" \"What is the nature like?\" \"How can we live there and adapt quickly? How can we make friends?\" \"What is the weather like there?\" \"Which places can we visit?\" They are all too aware that their first challenge will be the fact that they don't speak Spanish, but both young men are desperate to continue their education, having been forced to abandon their university studies when they left Idlib. Inevitably, the conversation turns to football; the brothers say they are looking forward to playing and watching it in Uruguay. Their favorite players? Neymar, Messi, and -- of course -- Luis Suarez. As the plane makes its way across the vast South American continent, Nassar studies the flight's interactive map on a screen. \"Hours have passed and we are still flying above Brazil!\" he says in amazement at the size and scale of the countries passing below. After a brief stop in Buenos Aires - a chance for the refugees to stretch their legs after more than 19 hours flying - they are finally on the last leg of the journey, a short hop to Montevideo. The children, by now familiar with the in-flight entertainment system, keep themselves occupied as they near their destination. Two of their fellow passengers, Uruguayans, greet the children with hugs and kisses after realizing who they are. \"We are very happy to welcome them to our country,\" they told CNN. Eventually, tired but with broad smiles on their faces, the enthusiastic group of refugees emerges from the Air France flight at Montevideo's Carrasco International Airport. They are greeted by President Mujica after their arrival. Mujica later told reporters he hopes more countries will follow Uruguay's example and offer homes to Syria's refugees. \"We must insist that the world moves in this direction; we can't continue with statements on human rights and [saying] that we support human rights if later we don't put our words into action, above all for the children.\" According to the U.N., there are more than 1.1 million Syrian refugees like Nassar's family registered in Lebanon, while the country's population is just over 4 million people. Lebanon's Minister of Social Affairs, H.E. Rashid Derbas, and UNHCR's Representative in Lebanon, Ninette Kelley, recently called for renewed investment in Lebanese infrastructure to help the country manage the influx of refugees from the Syrian conflict. \"Lebanon today faces an unprecedented challenge to manage both its own population and Syrian refugees,\" said Kelley. \"The presence of over 1.5 million Syrians across Lebanon has directly affected the public and service sectors at the national scale,\" Derbas explained. \"From Akkar all the way to the South, our towns and villages have been at the forefront of the humanitarian response to an incessantly escalating crisis. The inhabitants of these communities have opened their hearts and homes to the refugees. Therefore, the projects undertaken since 2011 have brought much needed breathing space to our communities and improved our lives and the lives of our Syrian kin.\" Walking from the plane towards his new home, one of the children proudly showed off his football shirt, bearing Suarez's number 9. At last, he and his family have reached their final goal: a new country and a new life, leaving memories of war behind.\n### Response:", "target": "Five Syrian refugee families have been flown to Uruguay to begin a new life there .\nThe group are the first of up to 120 Syrians who will be resettled in the South American country .\nFather-of-ten Nassar told CNN he was moving for the sake of his children's education .\n\"They deserve our help and they deserve the opportunity,\" said Uruguay's Human Rights Secretary .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Could you highlight the primary messages?\n### Input:London (CNN) -- As Iraq's insurgency was peaking, and American soldiers were dying at a dizzying rate from roadside bombs, a theater director in London was having an epiphany. Plenty of plays about the Iraqi carnage were piling up on his desk, but there were none about the the calamities befalling Afghanistan. It was then that Nicholas Kent, director of the tiny Tricycle Theatre -- far from the glitz and glamour of London's fabled West End playhouses -- decided to act. \"I became aware in 2007-2008 how it was all going wrong in Afghanistan,\" he said. \"It wasn't being reported in the media and certainly there was no artistic response to it.\" He commissioned a dozen writers to produce a dozen short plays on Afghan history. The result, \"The Great Game,\" changed the Afghan debate in the United Kingdom at a stroke. When the Chief of Britain's Defence Staff, Sir David Richards, saw the performance, he said, \"I wish I'd seen it before I first deployed to Afghanistan in 2005. It would have made me a much better commander.\" And the performance is now on its way to the Pentagon. Kent says Gen. Richards has been a significant driving force in bringing the performance to his American counterparts. \"The Great Game\" is usually performed over three days, with four half-hour plays performed back-to-back each day. Part one \"traces the history of foreign and Western involvement in Afghanistan since the defeat of the British in 1842,\" Kent said. The second installment of the trilogy \"is more or less a reflection of now,\" he said: \"The Soviet surge that fails over a decade, through the coming of the Taliban and the arrival of U.S. troops.\" The final four plays highlight the problems facing aid workers, Afghans and troops today. The British and American military are getting special performances, playing the whole cycle out in one day rather than three. Kent wanted to stimulate debate and discussion on a conflict he felt was wrong. \"You are putting yourself in some one else's boots,\" he said of what happens to the audience. \"You are empathizing, you are sympathizing with people, thinking what you would do in their situation.\" He is thrilled that both the British and now the American military have taken such a significant interest in the production, saying there can be no better way to grapple with the complexities of Afghanistan. \"If you read a book you can put it down. If you read a newspaper you can turn the page. If you see some television you can switch channels,\" he said. \"With a play, you are stuck there for some time, and in this case for a whole day. You have to really think about the challenges.\" But it's not just his audiences who have been challenged. \"The Great Game\" has changed Kent's own views. He now thinks pulling troops out precipitously would be a disaster and is increasingly concerned about instability over the border in nuclear-armed Pakistan -- so much so that he's considering a play on non-proliferation. Kent is a product of his own ethos, learning from his experiences. \"If people start to think outside the box and look at these issues through a different form, rather than in a lecture hall but maybe through an art form, they may learn quite a lot,\" he said.\n### Response : ", "target": "A London theater company commissions a cycle of plays about Afghanistan .\nBritain's top general says seeing it sooner would have made him a better commander there .\nHe has been instrumental in getting America's top brass to watch it .\nThe theatre director says the plays have changed his own mind about the conflict too .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

While \"The Avengers\" was predicted to be a hit, the performance outpaced expectations. Box Office Mojo, for instance, had projected the film would pull in $172.5 million on its opening weekend. Its ultimate domestic haul is well ahead of the $168 million \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2\" conjured up in its opening weekend domestically in July. The stateside fun for Disney and the comic book-inspired cast began on Friday when the movie took in $80.5 million, a figure that the studio described as the second-highest one-day domestic total. Saturday's receipts added up to $69.7 million, which Disney said was a record for that weekend day. Add international ticket sales since opening April 25 -- including openings in Russia, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Malaysia, New Zealand and the Philippines -- and \" The Avengers\" has already amassed $641.8 million in its first 12 days. Its success is another boon for the movie industry, which racked up about $2.3 billion at the U.S. box office for the first three months of 2012 -- up almost 46% from a year earlier, according to Box Office Mojo. Still, in some ways Hollywood had nowhere to go but up after posting its worst year for ticket sales in 2011 in 16 years. \"It's already started out to be a strong year,\" James Gross, analyst with Buckingham Research, said of 2012.

{"source": "### Instruction:Give me a one line summary of the story below:\n### Input:(CNN) -- Turks have picked prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to be the country's first directly elected president. Erdogan secured 52% of the votes in the first round of the presidential election, narrowly avoiding a runoff, according to Turkish election board. Turkey is a parliamentary democracy and the prime minister is the head of its government. The president's role is more formal, and represents the country as the head of the state -- similar to the Queen in the UK. But Erdogan has already indicated he would like to see more powers being transferred to the presidential palace, speaking about a \"new era\" in his victory speech. \"With the president elected directly by the citizens, all barriers between the people and the presidential palace have been removed,\" he was reported as saying in his speech by the Turkish media. Here is what you need to know about the historic election. Why does Erdogan want to be president if he is more powerful as prime minister? The former mayor of Istanbul and the leader and co-founder of the Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2003 and has been serving his third term as prime minister. While the constitution would have allowed Erdogan to run again when his term finishes next year, his own party rules prohibited him from seeking fourth term. His transition to presidency was seen as a logical step for a politician who wanted to maintain political power. Karabekir Akkoyunlu, researcher at the London School of Economics, said the country's constitution -- drawn up by the military junta in 1982 -- gave the head of state significant authority. Erdogan, Akkoyunlu said, would likely push those to the limit by \" invoking the 'national will' he claims to embody.\" What issues will he face next? The Kurdish peace process is one of the most pressing issues of the coming months. Turkey passed a law in July establishing a legal framework for peace talks with the Kurdish militants to end three decades of insurgency. \"The Kurdish peace process is also linked with regional dynamics and the rise of the Islamic State, which is now threatening the Kurds in northern Iraq and Syria,\" Akkoyunlu said. Erdogan will also have to work with the government in trying to tackle Turkey's economic troubles. The IMF and OECD have both warned Turkey's economy remains vulnerable to dangers outside its borders. High inflation, low employment and the country's chronic inequality are putting it at risk. Who else was running? The main opposition parties, the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) had nominated Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu as their joint candidate. The former secretary general of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) was campaigning on the idea of national unity and secured 38% of the vote. Selahattin Demirtas, a left-wing politician popular with Turkey's Kurdish minority, ran for the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) and finished third with 10%. Around 25% of people in Turkey identify themselves as Kurdish. Why does this matter? Turkey's geographical position and cultural make-up has contributed to the country being seen as a powerful bridge between Asia and Europe. Its membership of NATO and candidacy to join the European Union reflect its importance. The country's $800 billion economy is among the 20 biggest in the world and attracts $200 billion in foreign direct investment every year.

{"source": "### Instruction:Produce an article summary of the following news article:Doc to summarize:(CNN) -- The evidence, and the claims: . The knife . Prosecution says: A knife found in co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito's house has the DNA of Amanda Knox on the handle and of victim Meredith Kercher on the blade, suggesting it's the murder weapon. Defense says: The knife doesn't match the shape and size of wounds on Kercher's body or an outline of the knife left on her bed. The defense also presented experts who said DNA on the blade was too small to be definitive. DNA on Kercher's bra clasp . Prosecution says: A bra clasp that was ripped from Kercher's bra and found on the floor of her room has DNA of Raffaele Sollecito on it, proving he was in the room when she was killed. Defense says: The bra clasp is contaminated and essentially tainted evidence because it was moved around the crime scene and left there for more than six weeks before it was picked up as evidence. Knox's confession . Prosecution says: During her interrogation, Knox said she could hear Kercher screaming. She also pointed the finger early on at Patrick Lumumba, who was eventually released. The prosecution said Knox's false statement proves she is lying and was at the home when Kercher was killed. Defense says: Knox's statements were made when she was asked to imagine what would have happened that night in her apartment. The defense maintains Knox pointed the finger at Lumumba because she was confused and pressured. Eventually the confession was thrown out because Knox was not questioned with a lawyer present. Bloody footprint on bathroom rug . Prosecution says: The prosecution attributed a bloody footprint on a rug in the bathroom to Sollecito, which they say proves he was there at the time of the murder. Defense says: Sollecito's lawyers presented forensic experts who said the print is in no way a match to Sollecito, but instead a match to Rudy Guede, who was convicted separately in the case. The defense focused on Sollecito's hammer toe, which they say wouldn't leave an imprint like the print found on the mat. The window . Prosecution says: A broken window in the home Knox shared with Kercher was an attempt by the American to stage a break-in as a cover for the murder. The prosecution maintains it would be impossible for someone to break the window and climb through the window as proposed by the defense. Defense says: The window was broken by Guede, a known drifter who had broken into homes before. Defense expert Francesco Pasquali simulated how glass would break if a rock were thrown from the outside. His testimony included that he believes a burglar could have thrown a rock that way, not from the inside (to stage a robbery) as the prosecution maintains. Allegations of crime scene contamination . Defense says: The defense has argued that several pieces of key DNA were contaminated at the scene. Crime scene video shows investigators sometimes not wearing gloves or hair coverings, prodding their fingers in Kercher's wounds, leaving key pieces of evidence at the scene for weeks and moving them around, and at one point breaking a window for no reason. Prosecution says: The prosecution has argued that all the evidence was indeed properly handled and that it isn't their job to prove the crime scene work was good enough. Instead, they say, that's the job of the defense. Bloody shoe print in Kercher's room . Prosecution says: The bloody shoe print found next to Kercher's body belonged to Sollecito and placed him in Kercher's room when she was murdered. Defense says: After Guede, a man from the Ivory Coast who was convicted in a separate trial for murdering Kercher, was found to have a shoe box for shoes matching the print, they argued for a re-examination of the print. Francesco Vinci, a coroner and forensic specialist for Sollecito, testified he believes it was wrongly attributed to Sollecito and belongs to Guede.\n### Response: ", "target": "The verdict in Amanda Knox's appeal will be heard after the defendant statements next week .\nAmerican is charged with the murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher .\nKercher had her throat cut in the house she shared with Knox in Italy in 2007 .\nKnox and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito are fighting to overturn their 2009 convictions .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Milan also have a game in hand meaning they could potentially draw level with the four-in-a-row champions if they were to win next weekend's crunch clash. The hosts started in determined mood following Inter's 2-2 draw at Bari on Saturday and Ronaldinho took an Alessandro Nesta cross on his chest on three minutes before sending a spectacular overhead bicycle kick just off target. But on 10 minutes the referee took the decision that essentially ended the game as a contest. Jardim Brandao dithered on the ball in his own box and Marco Borriello dispossessed him before trying to go round goalkeeper Gianluca Curci. There was minimal contact and Borriello crumpled to the ground but the striker's last touch had been too heavy and left him no chance of reaching the ball before a back-tracking defender. Even so, the referee pointed to the spot and showed Curci a straight red card. Substitute goalkeeper Gianluca Pegolo's first task was to pick the ball out of his net. Siena battled on gamely, and on 26 minutes Massimo Maccarone escaped three defenders on the edge of the Milan box to bundle through before firing over on the stretch as Thiago Silva came across to put him under pressure. Two minutes later the lead was doubled as Andrea Pirlo curled a cross into the near post and Borriello hooked a brilliant volley over his shoulder and into the top corner. Ronaldinho proved a constant menace and had two early second half chances, flicking the ball over the bar with the first and being denied by Pegolo with the second. But 18 minutes from time he rose unmarked in the box to head home a David Beckham corner. The Brazilian sealed his first Milan hat-trick with a rocket into the top corner from outside the area a minute from time. Meanwhile, Juventus slumped to their seventh defeat in 10-games with a 1-0 reverse at Chievo that is sure to increase the pressure on under-fire coach Ciro Ferrara. Gennaro Sardo's stunning first-half strike proved to be the only goal of the game as Juve turned in a performance lacking energy and confidence which comes on the back of a 3-0 hammering at the hands of Milan in their last league outing. Juve dropped to fifth and out of the Champions League places as both Roma and Napoli overtook them. Roma moved up to third as on-loan Bayern Munich striker Luca Toni scored his first goals for the club in a 3-0 win over Genoa. Simone Perrotta opened the scoring on 17 minutes after a scramble at a corner and then Toni turned home Mirko Vucinic's cross on the stroke of half-time. And, on the hour mark, Vucinic turned provider again for Toni to head home his second. Napoli could not fully capitalize as they were held 0-0 at home by Palermo but still extended their unbeaten league run to 14 matches.\n### Response:", "target": "Brazilian Ronaldinho plundered a hat-trick as AC Milan crushed 10-man Siena 4-0 in Serie A .\nThe result means Milan close the gap on Serie A leaders and city rivals Inter Milan to just six points .\nJuventus continue to slide down the table after slumping to a 1-0 defeat at Chievo .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Police official Babar Bakhat Qureshi told CNN that officers arrested several suspects who were plotting to attack the compound of Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani. Shabir Anwar, Gilani's press secretary, had no comment on the alleged plot because it is a security matter. The plot to strike the compound, located in the Punjab provincial city of Multan, was in its \"final planning stages,\" Qureshi said. The location is about 395 kilometers, or 245 miles, southeast of the nation's capital, Islamabad. The suspects were planning to use a car bomb for the attack, and that they had acquired large amounts of fertilizer to manufacture an improvised explosive device, since confiscated by police, he said. A vehicle for the attack had not been acquired yet. The police confiscated one kilogram of gold and and two and a half kilograms of silver, which the men were going to sell to fund the plot, the official said. Qureshi said the suspects have confessed that they were getting their orders and instructions from Kari Imram, a leader of a Taliban offshoot group from Miran Shah in North Waziristan. Drone strikes said to be conducted by the United States have targeted militants in North Waziristan, one of seven of the county's tribal districts.

Kenyan and Somali ground forces are in control of the northern part, which is the old city, after a day and a half of fighting, spokesman Cyrus Oguna told CNN. They are consolidating the areas they have gained before moving into the south, where the Islamic militant group is believed to be, he said. The military launched airstrikes against the group Saturday. \"Al-Shabaab has not been able to offer any resistance whatsoever to the ground forces since the ground forces landed there yesterday, and the whole of yesterday and the good part of today they have (suffered) heavy casualties,\" Oguna said. More: Mogadishu bombing kills Somali broadcaster . The Kenya Defense Forces inflicted \"massive destruction\" on Al-Shabaab's infrastructure Saturday, using jets and helicopter gunships to destroy three of the group's bases, according to the military's official Twitter account. \"Great care and caution has been exercised to avoid collateral damage,\" it said. But in a series of posts Saturday on a Twitter account often used by Al-Shabaab, the group said the Kenyan military is \"waging a losing battle\" in Kismayo. It said mujahedeen forces ambushed Kenyan troops 30 km (18 miles) west of Kismayo, destroying three vehicles and killing dozens of troops in a two-hour battle. Oguna said those reports are \"pure propaganda.\" \"There has been no major ground forces engagement,\" he said. Kenya's military makes up the majority of troops in an African Union offensive to drive Al-Shabaab out of Somalia, where the group has long tried to overthrow the government. Al-Shabaab has suffered setbacks in the fight, including losing control of much of the capital, Mogadishu, last year. That made Kismayo even more critical for the group, which uses the port to profit from the illegal charcoal trade and smuggling operations. More: Soldiers killed in blast targeting Somali president . Thousands of civilians fled the city this month as fighting loomed, according to the U.N. refugee agency. It said that Somalis were leaving in minibuses, in trucks and on donkey carts. \"Great care and caution has been exercised to avoid collateral damage,\" the Kenyan military said Saturday. Since crossing into Somalia in October, Kenyan commanders and politicians have stated more than once that capturing Kismayo was the ultimate aim of their operation. The military's operation to take Kismayo began with airstrikes and naval gun support three days before the ground troops arrived, Oguna said.

His family, from Maryland, donated his face to Norris. \n  \n The Virginia man had undergone dozens of conventional operations to try to repair damage from the shooting accident in 1997, when he was 22. They had limited success, leaving him depressed and suicidal. \n  \n The Aversano family\u2019s donation gave him another chance. In one of the most complex face transplants in history, a team at the University of Maryland medical centre took 36 hours in March 2012 to transplant teeth, a jaw, tongue muscles and nerves. \n  \n Norris, now 39, thanked Rebekah in a meeting at his home in Virginia.

We are just so pleased we have been able to help him. Even though we had such a tragic loss, we were able to give someone else the benefit of our son.\u201d \n  \n Norris said that before the transplant he lived through hell, venturing out at night to minimise contact with people and wearing masks to disguise the horrific injuries caused by an accidentally self-inflicted shotgun blast. \u201cI\u2019ve heard all kinds of remarks. A lot of them were really horrible,\u201d he said. \n  \n He chose to have the transplant even though doctors gave him only a 50% chance of survival. \n  \n The doctor who performed the operation, Eduardo Rodriguez, said Norris took on an enormous responsibility because his body will always regard the new face as a foreign object, prompting attacks by his immune system. \n  \n Norris cannot drink, smoke or get sunburned and must take a cocktail of anti-rejection drugs for the rest of his life. \n  \n A naval research grant intended to help wounded military veterans partly funded the operation. \n  \n Doctors in France performed the world\u2019s first partial face transplant in France in 2005 on a woman who was mauled by her dog.

Announcing its decision on Friday, the FA's Regulatory Commission concluded that Ferdinand's comment, which described Cole as a \"choc ice,\" brought the game into disrepute by referencing a person's ethnic origin, color or race. The Manchester United and England defender was charged in July after he responded to a tweet describing Cole as a \"choc ice,\" re-tweeting: \"I hear you fella! Choc ice is a classic! Hahahahahaha!!\" The FA heard evidence from Herman Ouseley, a former chair of the UK's Commission for Racial Equality who explained that \"choc ice\" was \"an offensive and insulting term ... used to question a person's identity, based on the notion that they have a dark outer skin but inside they act as a white person ... It means the person is fake.\" Ferdinand's comment was posted on July 14, the day after John Terry was cleared of racially abusing Ferdinand's younger brother Anton during a Premier League match between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers in October 2011. Cole had been called as a character witness for his Chelsea teammate during the hearing held at Westminster Magistrates Court in London. Although upholding the charge and fining Ferdinand, the FA stressed that it did not believe Ferdinand to be a racist, describing him as someone who has \"a track record in fronting anti-racism campaigns in football.\" Ferdinand, who is one of football's most high profile \"Twitterers\" with over three million followers, has declined to appeal the decision. Greg Stobart, a football correspondent for Goal.com told CNN: \"The fine is perhaps a little bit harsh. The thing I would say is that it was a foolish thing to do, but we know Rio was emotional because his brother was involved in the case.\" He's not the first to fall foul of the FA for comments on Twitter, Stobart says, with Arsenal's Emmanuel Frimpong recently being fined \u00a36,000 ($9,500) after admitting a charge of improper conduct. \"Players need to be more careful,\" Stobart said. \"(Twitter) is a public forum ... you've got to be responsible.\" Despite being cleared by the court, John Terry has also been charged with improper conduct by the FA for his alleged comments to Anton Ferdinand during the match last October.\n### Response :", "target": "Manchester United defender found guilty of improper conduct and fined by English Football Association .\nFerdinand commented on a tweet which had referred to Ashley Cole as a \"choc ice\"\nCole was a character witness for John Terry at a court hearing which alleged he racially abused Ferdinand's brother Anton .\nTerry cleared by London court in July but is awaiting fate of improper conduct charges by FA .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Sheila Aimette, of fashion forecaster WGSN, says fashion followers are in for a sweet surprise with candy-colored pastels. (WGSN is the official trend sponsor of the bi-annual Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.) Amidst garden party hues of blush rose and bold peony, Aimette also expects designers to add a vivid splash of blue -- from icy aqua to classic navy -- to liven up the softer hues. Fall trends at the top of the class . \"I suspect we will see a continuation of resort (wear) -- big florals, art-inspired prints, offbeat pastel combinations and architecturally minded separates and sportswear-inspired ideas,\" predicts Anne Slowey, fashion news director of Elle Magazine. Aimette agrees: Flora and fauna will be flourishing, even in mismatched patterns on top and bottoms. \"There will be a lot happening in print and pattern because the silhouette is architectural and sleek,\" Aimette says. See all of CNN Living's New York Fashion Week coverage . Denim will also be on double duty; expect to see the wardrobe staple in skinny-legged, dark washes, paired with a boyfriend-fit chambray shirt. Aimette says colored denim's appeal will fade, while basic indigo is back. When it comes to bottoms, there's no middle ground -- or hem. Expect pleated-kilt miniskirts or midcalf skirts.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?\n### Input :(CNN)  -- One of eight people killed in a southeast Georgia mobile home last month recently had been awarded $25,000 in a civil lawsuit, officials said. Guy Heinze Jr. faces eight counts of first-degree murder in last month's killings in a Georgia mobile home. Guy Heinze Sr., 46, was granted the award by the McIntosh County, Georgia, Magistrate Court in a suit over a mobile home that he owned, court officials said. He had not received the money as the ruling was under appeal. Heinze was found dead August 29 in his Brunswick mobile home along with six others. An eighth person died later at a hospital. Police said all of the victims died from \"blunt force trauma,\" but they did not provide any further details. Heinze's son, Guy Heinze Jr., 22, faces eight counts of first-degree murder in the deaths. Police suspect he acted alone, according to a statement from the Glynn County Police Department. The younger Heinze has made his initial court appearance via closed-circuit television from the Glynn County Detention Center, his attorney, Ron Harrison, said Tuesday. His preliminary hearing likely will come next week, Harrison said. The elder Heinze told relatives about the award days before his death, family members said. Court officials said the ruling was issued August 11, and an appeal was filed six days later. Harrison said he was aware of the award in the lawsuit but would not comment on it. Police also are aware of it, Glynn County Police Chief Matt Doering said, but he declined comment on whether it is being explored as a possible motive in the slayings.  Watch hints of a possible motive \u00bb . Harrison said he last saw his client on Friday, as he was not required to appear with him to hear the charges read. The younger Heinze \"continues to deny any involvement in the murders and urges anyone with information to contact authorities,\" he said Tuesday. He described his client as \"not good, disappointed, upset, angry.\" Heinze called 911 to report the slayings, telling the dispatcher, \"My whole family is dead.\" He was arrested just afterward and initially was charged with tampering with evidence and making false statements to a police officer as well as facing drug charges.  Hear the 911 call \u00bb . An arrest warrant said he provided police \"with false and misleading information about his whereabouts and involvement in the circumstances leading to him calling 911 to report the deaths of his family members\" and that he removed a shotgun from the mobile home and hid it in his car. He was arrested on the murder charges hours after being freed from jail on the initial charges. Family members said he was on his way to attend the visitation for the victims but was arrested before arriving. A police chaplain called relatives to tell them of the arrest, family members said. Police have not released the cause of death for any of the victims. Heinze told dispatchers in his 911 call they appeared to have been beaten to death. Funerals were held Saturday for seven of the eight victims. Besides the elder Heinze, they were Brenda Gail Falagan, 49; Russell D. Toler Sr., 44; Russell D. Toler Jr., 20; Chrissy Toler, 22; Michael Toler, 19; and Michelle Toler, 15. The funeral for the eighth victim, Joseph L. West, 30, is to be held mid-month. A ninth victim, a 3-year-old, was on life support at a Savannah, Georgia, hospital as of Saturday, her grandmother said. Guy Heinze Sr.'s father, William Heinze, told CNN affiliate WJXT-TV in Jacksonville, Florida, at the funerals that he doubted his grandson was responsible for the deaths. \"We want to know what really happened,\" he said. \"The police may think they know what happened, but we want to really know the truth.\" Brunswick is about 300 miles southeast of Atlanta on Georgia's Atlantic coast.

{"source": "### Instruction:Given the following news article, summarize the article:Geneva, Switzerland (CNN) -- Iranian officials sat down Monday with the United States and other countries trying to put the brakes on Tehran's nuclear program, a day after Iran announced it is self-sufficient in the nuclear fuel cycle. There was \"an exchange of views and concerns,\" between the Iranians and envoys from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany, a diplomatic source familiar with the talks told CNN. The Iranian nuclear program was the main issue on the table, the source said. Iran has previously said it did not want the talks to focus on that. Iran also raised some of its concerns, the source said, including attacks on two Iranian scientists in Tehran last week that left one dead and one injured. The diplomatic source and a Western official later both told CNN that the talks had ended for the day and would resume Tuesday. The United States and other countries fear that Iran wants to develop nuclear weapons, an allegation Tehran has always denied. The meeting in Switzerland is between Iran on the one hand and the so-called P5 plus 1 group -- the United States, China, France, Germany, Russia and United Kingdom -- on the other. But bilateral talks also are going on, the diplomatic source said, refusing to say who was talking to whom. The source asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. The talks are going on behind closed doors and no public statements have been made so far. They'll continue Tuesday, the source said. And the P5 plus 1 nations are prepared to offer more talks if the Iranians agree to focus seriously on the nuclear issue. The group has been meeting intermittently, with the last round of talks coming over a year ago. Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council, said Sunday the talks would try \"to underscore the concern of the entire international community in Iran's actions and intentions.\" Iran already faces stiff sanctions from the international community, because it has continued to enrich uranium. With the political barbs flying back and forth regularly, tensions were raised even further last Monday when bombers targeted two Iranian nuclear scientists. Iran blamed Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom's spy agencies for the attacks, which killed Majid Shahriari and injured Fereydoun Abbasi. But Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, told state-run Press TV on Sunday that the \"assassination of Iranian scientists will not hamper our progress.\" Salehi also said that Iran is now producing yellowcake, meaning its nuclear program is self-sufficient since it now produces everything needed to make nuclear fuel. He said the yellowcake came from the Gachin mine near Gander Abbas, on Iran's southern coast near the Strait of Hormuz. It's not clear that Iran actually has the technology to complete the entire nuclear fuel cycle, despite Sunday's announcement. But U.S. officials weren't surprised by the announcement, with Hammer saying, \"Iran has been trying to develop an indigenous program for years given that the import of yellowcake is banned by United Nations Security Council resolutions.\" He said the move raises further concerns about the Middle Eastern country's intentions, \"given that Iran's own supply of uranium is not enough for a peaceful nuclear energy program.\" CNN Senior International Correspondent Matthew Chance contributed to this report.\n### Response :", "target": "NEW: Sources say the talks are over for the day and will resume Tuesday .\nU.S., British, Chinese, Russian, French, German and Iranian officials meet .\nThe discussions are the first on Iran's nuclear program since over a year ago .\nIran expresses concern about attacks on its nuclear scientists .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

appearing adipose tissue with scattered lipoblasts exhibiting large hyperchromatic nuclei . \n immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the cells were strongly stained by s-100 protein which is a marker for fat ( figure 3 ) . \n therefore , this small tumor was diagnosed as a well -

{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.(CNN) -- For Nadya Suleman, being in the spotlight is a double-edged sword. The media have invaded her privacy and turned her into a carnival attraction, she told Oprah Winfrey on Tuesday. But Suleman also acknowledges that the media has also become a source of income for her, a single mother of 14 children. \"That [Star magazine] photo shoot was $100,000,\" Suleman said on Winfrey's show via satellite from California, referring to the January cover that depicted her \"bikini body.\" \"I was ashamed of that -- that's not my character -- but I felt as though I needed to do something,\" she said. \"I did it because there were 14 hungry mouths. I own full responsibility for providing for my children. We have some of that money left until I figure out another way to make ends meet.\" At this point, with eight 14-month old babies and six other children between the ages of 3 and 8, one of whom has autism, Suleman doesn't appear to have the time to take up a full-time job. She does have three nannies who help her during the day in shifts. But even so, Suleman says she is constantly counting heads, making bottles or keeping a child from hurting another, as was revealed when Winfrey's camera crew spent 24 hours in her home. \"You're so busy trying to keep up, you don't have time to think, reflect or feel anything,\" she told Winfrey. \"You can't regret children, but [my] choices were childish, immature and selfish. I wasn't thinking at that time.\" At the start of the interview, Winfrey made it clear that Harpo Productions, her multimedia company, didn't pay Suleman \"a dime\" and, in fact, Suleman approached Winfrey to tell her side of the story. \"Everything that [the media] have said so far about me, and about me wanting to do this on purpose -- I never wanted to use children for fame,\" Suleman said, adding that her rationale for implanting eight embryos at one time stemmed from a variety of factors. There was what she calls \"a childish desire to have a large family,\" and \"perhaps selfishness, trying to compensate for being an only child, trying to fill some missing piece inside,\" she said. \"I believe I've always coveted that connection, that attachment to another human being, and it felt safer with children than a significant other,\" Suleman added. Suleman emphasized repeatedly to Winfrey that she's determined to take care of her brood on her own, without government assistance and without turning to adoption or foster care. \"I will do everything as a mother to avoid that at all costs,\" she told Winfrey, although she said she would never consider a reality TV show, which she considers exploitative and borderline abusive, or doing porn, despite having received three offers since the birth of her octuplets. Yet Suleman did appear in a two-hour Fox special that documented the first six months of her octuplets' lives and aired on the network in August 2009. Around that time, there were reports that Suleman had signed on to do a reality show with U.K. production company Eyeworks. However, Suleman said that she \"would never do a reality show, that's been a lie from the beginning.\" She told Winfrey that she has \"been ashamed of myself to go through certain media outlets to provide for my children,\" before adding, \"this was my choice and my responsibility, and I didn't want to depend on anyone.\" As a result, Suleman said she lives \"every single day, every hour of the day, with a tremendous amount of guilt. I feel guilty when I look at the older ones, they all have different unique needs,\" she told Winfrey. \"I feel guilty when I'm holding one or two and I can't be there for the others when they're crying.\" Regardless of the way she markets her \"Octomom\" identity, Suleman said the biggest misconception people have about her is that she did it all for fame. \"I'm not a celebrity. I'm a pseudo-celebrity catapulted into this media mess,\" she said. \"Was I in denial thinking it wouldn't happen? Yeah. Did I want it? No.\"\n### Response:", "target": "On Tuesday's \"Oprah Winfrey Show,\" Nadya Suleman revealed what her life is like .\nShe said the media has both invaded her privacy and been a way to make money .\nShe said she never thought she would have 8 more kids, and doing so was a selfish choice .\nSuleman said she's determined to take care of her family on her own .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you briefly describe the text?(CNN) -- We've been nearing the end of the late-fees era for years -- and, thanks to technology, we're one step closer this week. Amazon just launched a no-fees library loan program for digital books. This shift actually started more than a decade ago with the DVD-rental business. Or, more specifically, when Reed Hastings, now the CEO of Netflix (er, Qwikster?), forgot to return a copy of the movie \"Apollo 13\" for six weeks and racked up a $40 late fee from a video-rental store. That inspired his DVD-by-mail service, according to a 2006 essay in The New York Times, in which customers pay a monthly fee for the privilege to leave \"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion\" under their couches for as long as they'd like without financial penalty. Ba-da-bing. No more late fees. (Customers still gripe about Netflix's prices, though). Now, books are the next frontier. Sure, there have been previous no-tech attempts to waive library fees. Some book-loaners have programs called \"Amnesty Week,\" in which good-willed librarians let anyone return an overdue book -- no questions asked. Last year, someone brought a 35-years-overdue book back to a library during one of these events. The fine otherwise would have been $1,400, according to Time. In other cases, the fees to be charged were so hefty that libraries just decide to give up. In Oakland, Jim Pavon returned a 78-years-overdue copy of a Rudyard Kipling book, according to a 2005 story in The San Francisco Chronicle. \"Stunned library officials agreed to waive the late fees,\" the paper says, \"which under the 1927 rate of 2 cents per day would have amounted to more than $550 by now.\" Digital books allow for a different approach. Instead of charging owners for overdue e-books, the files just lock up on the borrower's e-book reader or smartphone. \"E-books automatically expire,\" said David Burleigh, a spokesman for a company called OverDrive, which is managing this library book-loaning program for Amazon and has apps that work for other e-reading platforms. \"So that definitely is a benefit from borrowing e-books. And you don't have to go back and forth to the library. You can do it remotely.\" That's good for forgetful types, who can stash books away from weeks or decades before remembering they've borrowed them. And it's good for libraries, too, since they can loan these books out again right away -- rather than waiting for them to be returned. \"It's fantastic,\" said Carrie Russell, director of the American Library Association's program on public access to information. The fact that libraries don't charge late fees on overdue e-books isn't a big deal, she said. \"Having been a librarian, the libraries don't really rely on late fees as a big budget boost,\" she said. \"It's negligible. It doesn't matter to us if we don't collect late fees. We'd rather the information gets out to people.\" Most digital book \"rentals\" last for two weeks. Libraries purchases a certain number of licenses for the digital books, and then lend those out to patrons. So it's not like the library can loan out 1,000 copies of \"The Help\" just because that book is popular. That's a good start, but is based on the \"print model,\" Russell said. In the future, she expects new \"Netflix models\" for books to emerge, where libraries pay monthly fees to publishers, perhaps, and can lend out as many copies of a book as their patrons would like. Amazon is in talks to do that for consumers, according to The Wall Street Journal. \"Customers would pay an annual fee to access a library of content\" under the potential plan, that paper says.

{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.\n### Input:WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The personal records of thousands of soldiers, employees and their families were potentially exposed after a laptop computer containing the information was stolen over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, the military says. But information security experts for the Army say it's unlikely that the information will be compromised because the data are guarded by three layers of security and encryption passwords. The security breach happened when the rental apartment of an employee with the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Academy was burglarized in Clermont, Florida, officials said. The theft was reported to local police November 28, but the military was not notified until the employee returned to work three days later. Military officials say the employee was using the laptop for remote training courses, and it has not been determined whether any protocol was breached. The computer contained \"names and personally identifiable information for slightly more than 42,000 Fort Belvoir Morale, Welfare and Recreation patrons,\" according to a posting on the Web site for the fort, which is in Virginia. CNN obtained the notification letter sent, almost two weeks later, to those affected. It says, in part, that the alleged compromised information \"includes your name, Social Security number, home address, date of birth, encrypted credit card information, personal e-mail address, personal telephone numbers, and family member information.\" The letter recommends steps to guard against the possibility of identity theft. The military says the lag in notification time was because of a policy requiring risk assessment before alerting those affected. The Family and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Command operates facilities such as child care centers, bowling centers and outdoor recreation facilities. Those facilities are available to anyone with a military ID, which includes active-duty troops, Department of Defense civilians, family members and retirees. This isn't the first time a missing laptop has resulted in a potential security breach for the military. In 2006, a Veterans Affairs Department analyst lost a laptop computer that contained the Social Security numbers and other personal data for more than 26 million veterans and active duty troops. That incident, in addition to other major data breaches, prompted a national call for protection of personal information. A bill currently under consideration in the Senate would put more protections in place.\n### Response :", "target": "Employee's laptop containing personal data was stolen over holiday weekend .\nArmy says data guarded by layers of security and encryption .\nMilitary sent letter to those affected two weeks after theft .\nRisk assessment forced lag in announcement, military says .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?(CNN) -- It's been three years since Japan was hit with its worst-ever earthquake, causing serious damage to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The 9 magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami sent three of Fukushima's reactors into melt-down, shocking the world. Japan, a fully industrialized country with high safety requirements, was facing a nuclear disaster of a similar scale to the deadly 1986 Chernobyl accident, in Soviet Ukraine. As a result, many countries decided to review their energy policies. Before the accident, 442 nuclear power reactors in 30 countries produced 14% of all world's electricity. This number dropped to just 11% in 2012, as 15 reactors exited service -- mainly in Germany and Japan. Today, 435 reactors operate in 31 countries, and a further 68 are under construction. After the Fukushima disaster, Japan pulled back its nuclear ambitions, ordered large-scale inspections and introduced new safety regulations. All of its 48 remaining reactors have been kept offline and a proposal to restart the program awaits parliament's approval. Germany shut down eight of its oldest reactors almost immediately after Fukushima, focusing instead on renewable energy, and phase-out all of its nuclear power by 2022. Switzerland adopted a similar approach when the government decided not to build any new reactors and phase out its nuclear production by 2034. This was despite a national referendum in which a majority of people voted in favor of more reactors. But not all countries got scared. Both France, which has the world's highest share of nuclear power for its electricity production, and the U.S., the world's largest producer, reaffirmed their positions on the power source. Both countries continue to invest heavily into safety improvements. All four \"BRIC\" countries are boosting their nuclear power production, with India aiming to supply 25% and Russia 45% of their electricity from nuclear power by 2050, and Brazil planning to build five new reactors by 2030. China is facing pressure to cut its pollution levels and reliance on coal. China already operates 20 reactors and aims to more than triple its nuclear capacity by 2020.

The indecent clothing charge has only one punishment under Sudanese law -- 40 lashes in public, according to the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information. \"These things have their ups and downs,\" Adib said. \"These laws have generally relaxed as a matter of policy. But they are still sometimes enforced.\" The Arabic Network humans rights organization said the threat of flogging was retaliation for Hussein writing critically about the Sudanese regime. However, Adib does not think his client was targeted. \"There are round-ups that they do and it is indiscriminate,\" he said. \"I don't think she was targeted specifically. They attack public and private parties and groups. They are called 'morality police' and she was just a victim of a round-up.\" U.N.

{"source": "### Instruction:Could you highlight the primary messages?\n### Input:Moscow (CNN) -- There is no basic human right to barge into a church to make a political statement, jump around near the altar, and shout obscenities. But there is most certainly the right not to lose your liberty for doing so, even if the act is offensive. But that is exactly what happened Friday. A court in Moscow sentenced the three members of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot to two years in prison. In my two decades monitoring human rights in Russia I've never seen anything like the Pussy Riot case -- the media attention, the outpouring of public support, the celebrity statements for the detained and criminally charged punk band members. The image of three young women facing down an inexorable system of unfair justice and an oppressive state has crystallized for many in the West what is wrong with human rights in Russia. To be sure, it is deeply troubling. For me, even more shocking were the images of Stanislav Markelov, a human rights lawyer, lying on the sidewalk with the back of his head blown off in 2009, or the body of tax lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in prison in 2009 after he blew the whistle on a massive government extortion scheme. The Pussy Riot case shines a much needed, if highly disturbing, spotlight on the issue of freedom of expression in post-Soviet Russia . On February 21, four members of the group performed what they call a \"punk prayer\" in Moscow's Russian Orthodox Christ the Savior Cathedral. They danced around and shouted some words to their song, \"Virgin Mary, Get Putin Out.\" The stunt lasted less than a minute before the women were forcibly removed. The same day, a video widely shared on social media showed a montage of the stunt with the song spliced in. The song criticizes the Russian Orthodox Church's alleged close relationship with the Kremlin and the personally close relationship of President Vladimir V. Putin with the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Three of the band members were tried on criminal \"hooliganism\" charges. Their trial was theater of the absurd. In their closing statements, the women and their lawyers delivered devastating critiques of the state of justice and civic freedoms in Russia. During the Soviet era, the human rights landscape in Russia was stark. But since then the situation has been harder to figure out, often making it easier for outsiders simply to give the government a pass. But the devil is in the details. It has been incredibly difficult to pin down any involvement of officials in the beatings and murders of investigative journalists and human rights activists. And the government, while not silencing civil society groups outright, tries to marginalize, discredit, and humiliate them, and crush them with heavy-handed bureaucracy, trumped-up accusations, threats and the like. Whatever misdemeanor the three women incurred for their antics in the church should not have been transformed by the authorities into a criminal offense that in effect punishes them for their speech. It's typical, though, of how the authorities try to keep a lid on controversial issues. The Russian think tank SOVA has documented dozens of cases in recent years in which the authorities used the threat of extremism charges to silence critics. This also isn't the first time Russian authorities have misused criminal legislation to stifle critical artistic expression. In 2010 a Moscow district court found the co-organizers of a controversial art exhibit guilty of the vague charge of \"inciting religious hatred.\" The art exhibit organizers were fined. By making the Pussy Riot band members await trial in jail for almost six months, the authorities made clear how they plan to set boundaries for political criticism. After a winter of unprecedented, peaceful opposition protests, a dozen demonstrators whom the authorities claim were involved in a scuffle with police during a mass demonstration in May have been arrested and are being charged with crimes grossly disproportionate to their alleged actions. Police have searched opposition leaders' homes. Laws rammed through Russia's parliament this summer sent more signals: criminal liability for leaders of nongovernmental organizations for \"serious breaches\" of new restrictive regulations; much tougher sanctions for violating rules on public assembly; and new restrictions on the Internet that could easily shut down big social networking sites. Critics of the Kremlin have been subject to vicious harassment, intimidation and grotesque public smear campaigns. For years Russian human rights defenders have tried to draw attention to the lack of independence of the courts. With the unprecedented attention to the Pussy Riot trial, the surreal state of justice when political interests are at stake is there for all to see. What we really should be wondering isn't why Pussy Riot is so distinctive, but whether it's just the tip of the iceberg. Too often, foreign governments have resorted to wishful thinking about the direction Russia is heading. Talking about human rights at a high level -- where all things in Russia are decided -- is unpleasant business. It might be hard, but Russia won't respect other governments if they shy away. If three women in the defendants' cage had the courage to speak out about where Russia is headed, surely members of the international community should too. They, at least, won't be thrown in jail.

{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.\n### Input:(CNN) -- Thirty days of signs and signals have revealed to the world in Francis I, a pope who seems eager to earn the title pontiff, or bridge-builder. Beginning with his choice of a name, which evokes the beloved image of St. Francis of Assisi, the former cardinal of Buenos Aires, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, put the world on notice that change was afoot by forgoing the fancy red slippers and ermine stole favored by other popes. Since then he has shown a remarkable common touch in his encounters with the public and greater sensitivity to others than the man who came before him. Try as he did, Francis' immediate predecessor, Benedict XVI, never looked comfortable in his own skin, let alone in pastoral contact with others. Clad in his ornate robes, he seemed to keep the world at arm's length in a way that betrayed his long service as Rome's \"Rottweiler\" (a nickname he received from the press) in charge of disciplining those who deviated from doctrine. While personally warmer, the pope before Benedict, John Paul II, was stern when it came to religious matters and approached the world with an Us vs. Them mindset. As the church was rocked by a seemingly endless number of sex abuse scandals -- thousands of child victims and systematic cover-ups by the hierarchy -- he blamed secular society, especially the media, and capitalistic materialism. Pope Francis tasks cardinals with studying reform of Catholic Church . In contrast with John Paul and Benedict, Francis doesn't seem capable of greeting anyone without a big, sincere smile and whenever given the choice between clerical privilege and everyday human experience, he opts for the human. This was demonstrated most clearly as he visited a jail during Holy Week to symbolically wash the feet of a dozen people who represented the apostles. Among them were two women and two Muslims. Their presence, and Francis's ease with them, dismayed traditionalists who recoiled at the sight of females and non-Catholics being included in the ritual. It thrilled those who hunger for a more accessible and inclusive church. The survivors of clerical abuse, who I have come to know during three years of writing my book \"Mortal Sins,\" hope that Francis will bring real change. However, they have been discouraged by 30 years of church evasions and counterattacks and are understandably wary. Tough-minded evaluators, they criticize Francis' record on abuse in Argentina. There he was among many of the world's Catholic bishops -- fully 25% -- who failed to meet a deadline for establishing policies to deal with complaints and priests who were accused, according to the Wall Street Journal. Victims also wait for Francis to demonstrate that he will discipline offenders and reveal their records. \"We don't think statements make kids any safer,\" SNAP leader Barbara Blaine told me this week. \"Unless he makes kids safer, he's not doing his job.\" Blaine's \"show-me\" attitude is echoed by her SNAP colleague Peter Isely, who was sexually abused when he attended a Catholic boarding school in Wisconsin. Isely said he admires the new man's style and sees, in his personality, reason for hope. Vatican seeks to rebrand its relationship with science . \"St. Francis was the single greatest reformer in the history of the Catholic Church,\"' noted Isely. \"My favorite quote by St. Francis is, `Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible.' Confronting and reforming the church's global system of child sex abuse and cover-up, that is doing what is necessary. If Pope Francis does that, who knows what's possible? Better yet, what's impossible.\" Jeffrey Anderson, the attorney most responsible for the waves of litigation that have revealed the church's secrets on abusive priests, is even more optimistic. Regarded by some as the most dreaded enemy of institutional Catholicism, Anderson told me, \"This pope has already demonstrated in action and words a humility we haven't seen before. I see that as revolutionary and it is in direct contrast with the hubris that was the source of the abuse crisis. It gives me hope that he can, if he chooses to, go against the power structure and fundamentally change things. For today I have hope like I never had.\" Although I am also skeptical of church leaders and well aware of the hierarchy's long-standing failure on the abuse issue, Francis' first 30 days have led me to agree with Anderson when it comes to the new pope's personality. This is a shift for me, and I make it tentatively, because like all Catholics and former Catholics, I know we are susceptible to the influence of church stagecraft. We want to believe, and that desire has been exploited too often in the past. If Francis makes the changes that the church must make to end the sex abuse crisis, it will happen because he grasps and wields the power of his office. As a cardinal, he was bound by his oath of obedience to \"go along.\" As pope, he is the one who makes the rules and requires others to obey. What if one of those requirements included an open, transparent and serious program to make children safe and heal the trauma of the past 30 years? Pope to Vatican: 'Act decisively' on sex abuse cases . Many of history's transformational figures have been men who, when they finally achieved power, used it in surprising ways. Theodore Roosevelt, son of wealth and privilege, became the trust-busting enemy of corporate monopolists. Southerner Lyndon Johnson used his considerable skills to champion civil rights. Richard Nixon, Republican friend of industrialists, created the Environmental Protection Agency. Francis has his chance now.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?(CNN) -- Jimmy Fallon left us with great memories after five years on \"Late Night,\" but the pressure was on for his first time hosting \"The Tonight Show\" on Monday. Yet at the end of the hour, we were left with a \"Tonight Show\" that offered both surprising moments and big laughs, although it might've included a lot more than we'll see on an average night, since it was Fallon's first show. Will Smith was the night's guest, U2 provided some music, and house band the Roots was as sharp as ever. (As Fallon said during his opening monologue, they're \"the most talented band in all the land,\" and he \"couldn't do the show\" without them.) That alone was a set-up for a great show, but Fallon also called on celebrity friends like Tina Fey and Stephen Colbert to help him get his version of \"Tonight\" off to a good start. Jimmy Fallon's 'Tonight Show' debut: New show, same Jimmy . The effort paid off, as early reviews have been quite positive, with TVLine calling the show \"vibrant and fresh\" and USA Today saying Fallon was \"easy to like.\" Fallon was a hit online as well, with tweet after tweet praising his performance, even from Jay Leno fans: . If you missed the premiere or want to relive some of the best moments, here are our five favorite scenes from Fallon's first \"Tonight Show.\" 1. Will Smith and the \"Evolution of Hip-Hop Dancing\" Right away, it was clear that several of Fallon's \"Late Night\" staples weren't going anywhere, including his occasional \"Evolution of Dancing\" sketches. Fallon's first guest, Smith, helped him during an \"Evolution of Hip-Hop Dancing\" sketch, with both performers wearing '90s-style overalls and gamely showing off a number of hip-hop moves like the \"Running Man,\" \"Kid N Play\" and -- of course -- \"the Carlton.\" Smith was on fire during the whole episode. He later gave Fallon some heartwarming words of wisdom: . 2. A family affair . Fallon's dad, whom he jokingly referenced in his final \"Late Night\" episode as being disappointed in him, showed up along with the 39-year-old comedian's mom. Seeing his parents in the audience was a sweet moment for a guy who probably only dreamed he might ever host \"The Tonight Show\" as a kid. It was a nice way to start the show before getting into the typical monologue jokes. 3. The parade of cameos . Moments after sitting down to his desk for the first time, Fallon made reference to a \"buddy\" who owed him $100 after betting he would never host \"The Tonight Show.\" The next thing you know, Robert De Niro (Fallon's first \"Late Night\" guest) showed up with a $100 bill. Then Tina Fey followed with yet another $100 bill. And then Joe Namath, Mariah Carey, Lindsay Lohan, Tracy Morgan, Seth Rogen, Kim Kardashian, Lady Gaga, Mike Tyson and Joan Rivers (not seen on \"The Tonight Show\" since the Carson years, when she was banned) also showed up to slap down their Benjamins. Finally, Stephen Colbert arrived with $100 in pennies, took a selfie and announced \"Welcome to 11:30, b***h!\" It was a jaw-dropping moment to say the least, and we have to say we agree with this viewer: . 4. U2 at the Top of the Rock . All of these moments show how Fallon is planning to make \"The Tonight Show\" his own, but none presented his perspective quite like having U2 perform on the roof of the Rockefeller Center. The band set up came even before Smith was officially brought out as the night's guest. The sunset above the New York skyline during U2's performance looked beautiful, and it made for an original and unexpected moment. 5. U2, unplugged . Yep, U2 was so awesome on Fallon's \"Tonight\" that the band is taking up two moments on this list. Fallon said that if he ever had them on the show, he'd have them perform a song stripped down, with just acoustic guitars and Bono singing. On Monday night, U2 did just that, performing the Oscar-nominated \"Ordinary Love\" for the audience in a memorable, fitting end to the very first \"Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\" Fallon's 'Tonight Show': A throwback or new guard?\n### Response: ", "target": "Jimmy Fallon's first night as host of \"Tonight\" was well-received .\nCritics have called him \"easy to like\" and \"fresh\"\nOnline, social media were filled with praise .\nSome of the episode's best moments included Will Smith and U2 .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?\n### Input:(CNN) -- As rooms go, it's quite nice. It's shaped like an egg. It has a well-tended garden a few feet out the door, and then an expanse of lawn leading to a fence. It is certainly not the most ornate or luxurious room in the United States. Most five-star hotels have suites that out-glitter it. Any number of corporate CEOs boast offices that are larger and more lavishly outfitted. But the Oval Office at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington has always been the object of a singular kind of yearning. Mitt Romney fervently wants to move into it in January; Barack Obama just as fervently wants not to move out. This fall's presidential campaign, which begins in earnest with the Republican National Convention this week, will determine whether it will be Romney or Obama who gets his wish. CNN Poll: Which candidate cares more about you? Campaigns go by so quickly, and unfold so feverishly, that the combatants can be excused for not dwelling on the fact that each successive occupant of the Oval Office is, by definition, a transient. It's temporary work, the presidency, and the Oval Office is the traditional home of the most high-level temps in the world. I've been looking at two pieces of Oval Office video, each mesmerizing, even astonishing, in its own way. Neither was originally intended for public consumption. Each stars a man who is in his final weeks -- or in one case final hours -- as president. One of the men knows it. The other has no idea. The first video consists of outtakes from an interview that Chet Huntley and David Brinkley of NBC News conducted with President John F. Kennedy on September 9, 1963. Huntley and Brinkley were at the apex of their fame and journalistic influence; their evening newscast, \"The Huntley-Brinkley Report,\" was expanding from 15 to 30 minutes, and Kennedy had agreed to tape the Oval Office interview to launch the longer show. The main interview had concluded. But on the tape, Kennedy tells Huntley and Brinkley that he is dissatisfied with some of the answers he gave them. He wants to do them over. \"There's one or two places we're a little ragged,\" he says to the newsmen. And then, to be certain Huntley and Brinkley understand what he is asking for: . \"Let's try and do it again and we'll see what comes out this time.\" They accede; they redo the questions. And what comes across most strongly in the footage is the complete aura of command that Kennedy projects in that White House office. He appears filled with the Oval Office's inherent power and authority, and betrays not a smidgen of doubt that, for him, all of that will likely go on. Neither Kennedy, nor Huntley and Brinkley, could have had any inkling that within 12 weeks he would be dead in Dallas, that the two newsmen would be covering his funeral, and that Lyndon Johnson, not he, would be sitting in this office. In the outtakes, Kennedy gives Brinkley advice on whether a new Cary Grant-Audrey Hepburn movie is worth seeing; Kennedy seems supremely at home and at ease in that room. Leaving it looks to be the furthest thing from his mind. The other piece of videotape features a president who knows that, within 24 hours, he will be leaving the Oval Office, and the presidency, ahead of schedule. Most of us have seen Richard Nixon's resignation speech from the evening of August 8, 1974. But, in the five minutes before he addressed the nation, there was some calibrating of lights and checking of sound levels. Nixon was in the chair behind his desk for that. And it was all being recorded. Through the amalgam of overwhelming emotions that had to have been coursing through him -- he knew what he would be saying to the citizens of the United States a few minutes later -- Nixon grins. It is as if he does not want the technicians to see his anguish . To an assistant who, for purposes of lighting adjustments, is sitting in the president's chair behind the Oval Office desk as Nixon enters the room, Nixon says: \"Hey, you're better lookin' than I am. Why don't you stay here?\" To the person operating the television camera: \"Have you got an extra camera in case the lights go out?\" It's banter, in a dark American hour. He sit behind his desk and says: \"All Secret Service, are there any Secret Service in the room? Out.\" He gets no response, and because the camera is focused on Nixon we don't see the Secret Service agents. But it is clear that they do not depart, because Nixon says in their direction: . \"You don't have to stay, do you?\" Then: . \"You're required to?\" Finally: . \"I'm just kidding you.\" It is a difficult video to watch, because the moments are so raw. In its own way, it is even more revelatory than the resignation speech itself. Here is a man who worked all his life to make it to this room, and now he -- as Kennedy, in a very different context, did before him -- is leaving it earlier than he thought he would have to. Kennedy and Nixon may be the stars of those videos, but the real star is the room itself -- it is the one aspect of the videos that is sustaining and permanent. Mitt Romney and Barack Obama will battle all fall for the symbolic key to that room, even while knowing that, in the end, it will stop being theirs. Presidents depart; the Oval Office remains. Which may be at the heart of the lure that has made so many people over the centuries hunger to be there, for however brief or long a stay.

{"source": "### Instruction:Could you highlight the primary messages?Less than a year ago, Mark Driscoll, an evangelical pastor, was flying high. His hometown Seattle Seahawks were in the Super Bowl, and the brash pastor scored a big, faith-fueled interview with five of the team's top players, including quarterback Russell Wilson. But in a remarkably fast fall from grace, Driscoll resigned Tuesday as pastor of Mars Hill Church, a congregation he founded 18 years ago and turned into a force in the mostly secular Pacific Northwest. In a statement, Mars Hills' board of overseers said Driscoll hadn't committed any acts of \"immorality, illegality or heresy\" -- sins that have felled many a powerful pastor. Instead, the board said, Driscoll is guilty of \"arrogance, responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech, and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner.\" Driscoll was not asked to leave, the board added, saying they were \"surprised\" to receive his resignation letter. In that letter, obtained by Religion News Service, Driscoll says: \"Recent months have proven unhealthy for our family -- even physically unsafe at times -- and we believe the time has now come for the elders to choose new pastoral leadership for Mars Hill.\" The 43-year-old pastor acknowledged that, \"There are many things I have confessed and repented of, privately and publicly, as you are well aware. Specifically, I have confessed to past pride, anger and a domineering spirit.\" Before his resignation, a number of Mars Hills leaders fled the church, saying that Driscoll was not fit for leadership. He has also been accused of plagiarism and using a complex scheme to pad book sales. The pastor has apologized and said \"mistakes were made.\" The broader beef with Driscoll, though, seemed to be his more-macho-than-thou approach to fellow Christians. According to Christianity Today, the pastor had trolled online discussion forums under the pseudonym \"William Wallace II,\" and lambasted the supposed rise of \"male lesbians;\" \"feman,\" (men who act like women, in his definition); and \"men who allow their wives to nag at them.\" \"While the discussion board itself was a bad idea,\" Driscoll said in a letter obtained by Christianity Today, \"my decision to attack critics who were posting there (I did so by posting under the character 'William Wallace II') was an even worse idea.\" Even before that revelation, Driscoll was highly controversial and almost comically outspoken. He once said that mainstream Christians had turned Jesus into a \"Richard Simmons, hippie, queer Christ,\" and a \"neutered and limp-wristed popular Sky Fairy of pop culture that ... would never talk about sin or send anyone to hell.\" In a book he wrote with his wife in 2012, Driscoll delved into serious detail about his sex life, leaving some reviewers, and almost as many Christians, a bit uncomfortable. For all that, though -- or maybe, because of all that --  Driscoll was pretty successful by many measures. He built Mars Hill into a mini-empire, with 15 satellite locations and even a couple of universities. His books and sermons were read and heard by millions. In his resignation letter, Driscoll hints that his pastoral career isn't dead yet. \"My journey, at age 43, is far from over,\" he writes, \"I believe (God) has brought me a long way from some days I am not very proud of, and is making me more like him every day.\"\n### Response: ", "target": "Evangelical resigns from Mars Hill Church, which he founded 18 years ago .\nMark Driscoll's congregation became force in mostly secular Pacific Northwest .\nChurch board said he was guilty of \"arrogance,\" \"quick temper,\" \"harsh speech\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Guests will be immersed in the new Potter paradise, which spans about 20 acres and includes a high-tech ride, the Leaky Cauldron restaurant, a handful of elaborate shops and stage shows, and the Hogwarts Express train between Diagon Alley and the separate Hogsmeade area in the adjacent Islands of Adventure park. \"Universal smartly involved (\"Harry Potter\" series author J.K. Rowling) and the production designers from the Harry Potter films in every step of the design process,\" said Robert Niles, editor of themeparkinsider.com. This means nearly every detail, down to the cobblestone streets and the Hogwarts Express, is just as it was in the films. The marquee ride Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts puts guests smack dab in the middle of the recognizable grand bank lobby filled with hardworking animatronic goblins, some counting money, others jotting down bank records. Turn the corner and head down the hallway, and you realize you're in Bill Weasley's office. Then, board souped-up elevators that make you feel as if you are going deep into the cavernous vaults. Finally, hop into a 12-person vehicle that takes you into Gringotts Bank. It's part roller coaster, part 3-D motion-based ride. The other attraction, the Hogwarts Express, where Harry meets pals Hermione and Ron in the first movie, is equally detailed. It takes about four minutes to shuttle people back and forth between Hogsmeade (in Islands of Adventure) and Diagon Alley (in Universal Studios). Once on board, guests step into train carriages. As the doors shut, the 3-D video screens show images of Hagrid on a flying motorcycle, the Weasley twins on their brooms and the Knight Bus in London. But keep an eye on the doorway, where shadows of Dementors, Harry, Ron and Hermione make guests feel like they are in a scene from the movies. The themed land also includes a number of shops frequented by the young wizards in the movies, such as Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes, which sells unusual items like Skiving Snackboxes that come with Fainting Fancies, Nosebleed Nougats, Fever Fudge and Puking Pastilles. (In the movies, wizards use these to make themselves appear ill. In real life, they are sweet treats.) Inside Wiseacres, you'll find armillary spheres ($179.95), which wizards use in astronomy class, and in Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions, there are loads of Hogwarts ties and robes, quaffles and brooms ranging from $34.95 to $300. The Leaky Cauldron has a menu featuring British classics like toad in the hole (sausage baked in a flour-egg batter, $8.99), fish and chips, and bangers and mash. Plus, there are draught beers brewed specifically for Diagon Alley, including Wizard's Brew and Dragon's Scale, and non-alcoholic drinks like Fishy Green Ale and Tongue Tying Lemon Squash. Perhaps the most talked-about food item is butterbeer ice cream, served at Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour. There are live shows throughout the day. \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\" features a troupe of four from the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts. The lively performers retell two of the famed tales of Beedle the Bard, a 15th-century author of wizarding fairy tales. The other show is a lively musical performance featured in the Potter movies. The boy with the lightning-bolt scar on his forehead is ingrained in pop culture. So, it comes as no surprise that Universal continues to invest in the franchise. \"The Wizarding World of Harry Potter-Hogsmeade (which opened in 2010) has been one of the most successful attractions in the history of themed entertainment, in terms of attendance numbers, Universal's bottom line and the impact it has had on the rest of the industry,\" said Andy Brennan, industry analyst with IBISWorld. Likewise, expanding the Wizarding World by creating Diagon Alley at Universal Studios, which Brennan says has cost about $400 million to construct, was a no-brainer. \"Hogsmeade reportedly cost over $250 million,\" he added, \"so this is NBCUniversal's most significant investment to date.\" Plus, \"combined attendance at Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios has jumped more than 50% since 2009,\" Brennan said. \"NBCUniversal's theme park revenue is up nearly 40% since 2009, much of which can be directly attributed to the popular WWHP.\" Diagon Alley will certainly lure park-goers to Orlando, which is experiencing one of the most significant expansion periods in the destination's history. According to Visit Orlando, there were 59 million visitors in 2013, up 27% from 46.6 million in 2009. If you go: . Admission into Universal Studios Florida ($96 for adults and $90 for kids ages 3 to 9) allows you to roam around the park and visit Diagon Alley. However, if you'd like to pop over to Hogsmeade (at Universal's Islands of Adventure) via the Hogwarts Express, you must purchase park-to-park admission ($136 for adults, $130 for kids ages 3 to 9).\n### Response:", "target": "Diagon Alley at Universal Studios Florida expands the Wizarding World of Harry Potter .\nA new ride, Escape from Gringotts, is at the center of this part of the experience .\nGeneral admission to Universal Studios includes Diagon Alley but not Hogsmeade .\nPark-to-park admission is required to visit both Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Regular programming has just been interrupted by a news conference. A slender black man in a suit steps up to a podium, flanked by American flags and a White House logo. Michael Lamar, pictured after a Democratic fundraiser, has been in ad campaigns in Turkey and the Netherlands. \"I wish I could announce such an economic package,\" he says, \"but there is a bank in Turkey that did it. It is Garanti. I wish we had Garanti in America.\" Don't be fooled. This is a commercial on Turkish TV. The actor is a 44-year-old Barack Obama look-alike from Whitehall, Pennsylvania, named Michael Lamar. And he is shilling for a Turkish bank. In the month before the real Barack Obama is to visit Turkey, this ad campaign went out all across the country on television and on billboards, using the iconic image of the American president to sell low-interest loans. The men behind the concept say their Obama look-alike was the perfect guy to sell what they described as Garanti Bank's own economic stimulus package.  Watch Lamar as Obama \u00bb . \"We probably wouldn't be doing this commercial if it was the previous president,\" said Can Celikbilek, a copy writer at the advertising company, Alametifarika. \"But in the case of Obama, he does represent hope, not only for the States but for the whole world.\" For Obama look-alike actor Lamar, there was some irony about getting flown to Turkey to star in a commercial for a bank. He is a recent casualty of the global economic crisis. \"I was laid off in January of this year from JP Morgan Chase Bank in the U.S.,\" Lamar said, in a telephone interview from Pennsylvania. \"After 18 years in the company, I was just laid off. One of the cutbacks. I'm currently unemployed.\" Or, was unemployed. Lamar's striking resemblance to the American president has suddenly offered the former software analyst a possible new career for supporting his wife and child. \"I'm available full-time now,\" Lamar said. \"I'm going to see where this leads me.\" Lamar is now being represented by a casting agency in Los Angeles that specializes in celebrity look-alikes. Since he discovered his new \"talent,\" he has traveled to the Netherlands to appear in a commercial for a liquor chain and to Paris, where an activist organization brought him in to meet lawmakers at the National Assembly, as part of a campaign to raise awareness about racism and racial profiling in France. \"This was very exciting for me, a true privilege!\" Lamar said. During his brief visit to Turkey, locals did double-takes when they saw Lamar walk past. \"Even in the studio, the crew [members] were like, 'Oh! Is that Obama?\" said Celikbilek of Alametifarika advertising. Using the image of an American president to promote anything in Turkey is a remarkable reversal. U.S. approval ratings in Turkey plunged to 9 percent, according to a 2007 Pew Research poll, making America less popular in Turkey then almost anywhere else in the world, even though the two countries are NATO allies. There was widespread anger among Turks at the war in neighboring Iraq. But the election of Barack Obama appears to have dramatically improved perceptions of America. \"Bush was a dictator who attacked other countries,\" said Abdurrahman Ozdemir, who sells cigarettes from a small stall on the street. \"But we love Obama ... because he does not want to go to war with other countries.\" \"We started to love and like America because of Obama,\" said a 33-year-old woman named Begum Arinc. \"I don't want to see people dying. I don't want to see any war. That's why I want to believe in Obama.\"\n### Response:", "target": "Michael Lamar strikes an Obama-like figure in ads for a bank in Turkey .\nLamar worked for JP Morgan Chase for 18 years before being laid off .\nPresident Obama will be in Turkey soon on presidential visit .\nU.S. approval ratings in Turkey have plunged in recent years .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction :Can you walk me through the main ideas?\n### Input:(CNN) -- While President-elect Barack Obama will certainly be making history when he takes the oath of office on January 20, he'll also be repeating it -- by placing his hand on the same Bible that Abraham Lincoln used during the inauguration of 1861. The 1861 Lincoln Inaugural Bible against the backdrop of the Main Reading Room of the Library of Congress. The Constitution does not require presidents to be sworn in on a Bible, though almost every chief executive since George Washington has chosen to do so. Presidents have differed greatly, however, on the question of which passage the Bible should be opened to during the swearing-in ceremony. It brings up the question of what -- if any -- biblical passage Obama will emphasize. If what is past is prologue, as Shakespeare famously wrote (a quote now engraved in front of the National Archives), he might opt for the popular presidential theme of repentance. According to Gleaves Whitney, a presidential historian at Michigan's Grand Valley State University, II Chronicles 7:14 was used for three swearing-in ceremonies: \"If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.\" In this season of economic distress, however, the president-elect may prefer to follow the lead of Franklin Roosevelt. When FDR first took the oath of office in 1933, the country was reeling under the crushing weight of the Great Depression. \"Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment,\" Roosevelt said in his inaugural address. Urging his fellow Americans to lend a helping hand, Roosevelt had the Bible opened to I Corinthians 13: \"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.\" Obama campaigned as someone who would strive to bridge the nation's bitter partisan divide. \"We have never been a collection of red states and blue states,\" Obama said in his Election Night victory speech. \"We are, and always will be, the United States of America.\" If Obama wants to stress that theme again on January 20, he may prefer to follow Bill Clinton's lead from the 1997 inaugural and open the Bible to Isaiah 58:12: \"Thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations, and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach.\" Questions of war and peace are always in the back of any president's mind. Obama campaigned in part on a promise to end America's war in Iraq. Shortly after winning the White House on a similar pledge to end another divisive conflict -- this one in Vietnam -- Richard Nixon took the oath with a family Bible opened to Isaiah 2:4: \"And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\" With the polls showing an overwhelming majority of Americans convinced the country is on the wrong track, Obama might hint at a back-to-basics message by doing what Woodrow Wilson did in 1913. During his first inaugural, Wilson opened the Bible to Psalm 119, which concludes \"I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.\" Speaking of a return to basics, what about America's first president? What did George Washington do? Almost 220 years ago, in 1789, Washington opened the King James version of a Masonic Bible to Genesis 49:13 -- \"Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.\" Was America's first president trying to send a deep, profound message? Not exactly. It turns out that, for the nation's first inaugural, the Bible was hastily opened to a completely random page. The same thing was done 72 years later when Lincoln was sworn in. CNN's Brendan Polmer contributed to this report.\n### Response : ", "target": "Barack Obama will be sworn in using same Bible as Abraham Lincoln .\nLincoln's Bible was turned to a random page at his 1861 inauguration .\nMany presidents choose to open Bible to a specific verse .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?\n### Input:Madrid (CNN) -- Spanish police seized a total of 1,600 kilos of bomb-making materials this week from suspected ETA hideouts -- the largest haul ever against the Basque separatist group in Spain. Authorities also arrested three ETA suspects this week -- including one during a seizure on Thursday -- in the latest actions in a police crackdown against ETA despite its unilateral cease-fire declared last January 10. The Spanish government has vowed to keep up the pressure on ETA because the outlawed group, listed as a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States, has broken cease-fires in the past. The police on Tuesday arrested two men in northern Spain suspected of supplying explosives and bomb-making materials to ETA. A search of their property turned up 850 kilos (1,870 pounds) of bomb-making components. Then on Thursday, the police discovered another 750 kilos (1,650 pounds) of explosives and components at various suspected hideouts, and arrested a third suspect. The two seizures totaled about 3,520 pounds. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence, many of those due to car bombs and package bombs. Last month in France, police arrested the suspected military chief of ETA, in charge of commandos who carry out the bombings. In recent years, the police have arrested in succession a series of suspected ETA military chiefs as ETA replacements step in to fill the vacant position at the top. Also last month, in northern Spain, police arrested four key ETA suspects who authorities said had tried to operate under police radar, carrying on ostensibly law-abiding lives but secretly working for ETA. Police seized 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of explosives in those raids. Top government officials have said ETA appears to be weaker than ever, but they have warned that the group still has the capacity to kill. The Socialist government and the main opposition conservative party have said ETA's current unilateral cease-fire is not enough, and that only a commitment to permanently end the violence and lay down weapons would suffice. Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said last month, \"The government's anti-terrorist policy has not changed at all because ETA has not definitively abandoned its weapons. And as long as it doesn't, the police will continue to arrest them, one after another.\"\n### Response : ", "target": "Police seize 750 kilos of bomb-making materials from suspected ETA hideouts .\nThis week, more than 1,600 kilos of explosives and components have been found .\nETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its campaign for Basque independence .\nOfficials say ETA appears to be weaker than ever, but warn it the group is still deadly .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.In a move disavowed by the Libyan government, a retired military general led Libyan troops and other forces loyal to him in a deadly attack Friday against Islamist militants in and around the eastern city of Benghazi, Libyan media reported. At least 12 people were killed and 91 others were injured in clashes around the country's second-largest city, Libyan state news agency LANA said Friday, citing local hospitals. Retired Libyan Gen. Khalifa Haftar, who participated in the 2011 rebellion that ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi, launched the attack that supporters said was an attempt to clear the city of extremist groups, CNN affiliate Libya Awalan TV reported. The Libyan government and the military command in Tripoli reacted with alarm, saying that they didn't order the attack, and that the operation -- which they conceded included some Libyan soldiers -- amounted to a \"coup.\" That such a force could mount an attack without the government's blessing underscores the difficulty that Tripoli -- more than 400 miles to the west -- has had in trying to influence a dire situation in Benghazi, where Islamist groups have been blamed for near daily assassinations, bombings and kidnappings against security forces. A Libyan air force plane and 120 military vehicles took part in the unauthorized operation against the militants, acting Prime Minister Abduallah al-Thinni said on Libyan state-run TV. Residents of Benghazi, meanwhile, told CNN that they saw more than one military plane overhead Friday. It wasn't clear how many of the operation's fighters were members of the North African country's military. \"Their movements are against military orders issued by the legitimate authorities,\" al-Thinni said, adding that he felt the move undermined government-sanctioned efforts to fight militants in Benghazi. Haftar led the operation, Libyan army Chief of Staff Abdul Salam Jad said, describing the attack as an \"attempted coup on legitimacy,\" according to Libya's official LANA news agency. Retired general had promised action . Haftar was a commander under Gadhafi before the general defected in the 1980s. Haftar was in exile in the United States until he returned for the 2011 rebellion. In recent months, Haftar toured cities in eastern Libya, promising some kind of military offensive to purge Benghazi -- the cradle of the 2011 revolution against Gadhafi -- of Islamist extremist groups. Haftar's overtures came amid rising frustration in Benghazi that Tripoli hasn't been able to staunch radical Islamist militant groups' presence and influence, which has been rising since the revolution. Residents and officials have blamed the violence that has gripped Benghazi on groups including Ansar al Sharia. The United States designated that group a terrorist organization this year, and has accused it of being involved in the 2012 attack that killed four Americans -- including Ambassador Christopher Stevens -- at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. Official Libyan security forces have struggled to deal with hostile militias, so the government has relied on other militias, many on the state's payroll, in an attempt to enhance security. But various other political forces also have relied on militias, leaving the country awash in armed groups -- many who refused to disband after the revolution -- with competing agendas and loyalties. Al-Thinni called on government-sanctioned militias Friday to \"practice self-restraint\" and keep abiding by the Army's orders, . \"The government calls on the people in the capital of the revolution, Benghazi, to be calm and (to) support the legitimacy of the ... revolution and its police and army,\" al-Thinni said on state TV. Algeria temporarily closes embassy in Tripoli, citing unspecified threats . Meanwhile, Algeria temporarily closed its embassy and consulate in Libya's capital due to a \"real and imminent threat\" against its diplomats and consular staff in Libya, the Algerian Foreign Ministry said Friday, according to Algerian state-run news agency Algerie Presse Service. The ministry described the move in Tripoli as an \"urgent and protective measure in coordination with Libyan authorities after receiving confirmed information about a real threat against our diplomats and consular staff,\" according to APS.

Stephan Schmidheiny, the Swiss owner of the fiber-cement firm Eternit, was sentenced Monday alongside Belgian former executive and investor Jean Louis Marie Ghislain de Cartier de Marchienne. The pair were accused of failing to protect workers in the company's four Italian factories before they were shuttered in 1986. Schmidheiny's lawyer, Astolfo Di Amato, told CNN Tuesday that his client did not accept the sentence handed down by the court in Turin, an industrial hub in northwestern Italy. \"The sentence is certainly a setback, we lost the first battle. (It's) a defeat that we don't accept and we will present an appeal,\" the lawyer said. He said Schmidheiny had invested large sums in the 1970s in restructuring the plants' production process and had never set foot in Italy. \"The sentence is dangerous because if in Italy we affirm the principle that the major shareholder of a multinational company is responsible for what happens in each peripheral plant, no one will invest in Italy any longer,\" he said. Schmidheiny and De Cartier were also ordered to pay a total of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80 million ($105 million) to more than 6,000 people, including former workers and residents who lived near their plants. Bruno Pesce, the leader of Italy's asbestos victims association, said more than 1,500 people attended Monday's hearing -- including some who were suffering from asbestos-linked illnesses. \"It was a very emotional moment,\" Pesce said. \"People were crying because of tension and then of happiness.\" Renato Balduzzi, Italy's health minister, called the sentence \"historic.\" The Italian Eternit company was declared bankrupt in 1986, when the Italian plants were shut down, and the company's ownership changed in the 1990s. A spokesman for the Swiss Eternit company, Balts Livio, said it was independent from the Italian firm of the same name. \"Neither Eternit (Schweiz) AG nor its owner had or have any relationship with Eternit S.p.A., Genoa, and thus with the subject of the criminal proceedings in Turin,\" Livio said. Asbestos was once widely used as a fireproofing material and was included in roof shingles and siding for decades. Though now banned in Italy and most Western countries, asbestos is still used in developing countries, mainly in China and India. Exposure to its tiny fibers, particularly over a period of time, can lead to asbestos-related diseases that include lung cancer, asbestosis and mesothelioma, according to the National Institutes for Health.\n### Response: ", "target": "Stephan Schmidheiny will appeal his sentence in an Italian court, his lawyer says .\nSchmidheiny and a Belgian colleague are accused of failing to protect workers from asbestos .\nSchmidheiny's lawyer says the sentence will deter other big firms from investing in Italy .\nExposure to asbestos can lead to lung diseases and cancer .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Member John Cleese said at a news conference Thursday that the show will have some new material, but it will have many old bits -- some featured in perhaps new ways -- that fans will expect. \"I remember going to the Royal Albert Hall and seeing Neil Diamond where he got booed in the second half for singing new numbers. People really do want to see the old hits, but we don't want to do them exactly in a predictable way, so it's going to be a mix-up, I think,\" Cleese said. Opinion: Will Python humor still fly in 2013? Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Eric Idle and the late Graham Chapman became comedic legends with the creation of Monty Python's Flying Circus in October 1969. They produced 45 TV episodes for the BBC and five feature films together before going their separate ways in 1983. The shows mostly consisted of a string of barely coherent sketches, often lacking conventional punch lines and loosely tied together by Gilliam's stream of consciousness animations. Although the TV show ran for only four seasons, it proved a massive cult hit when it was shown in the United States beginning in 1974 -- just as the show was winding up on the other side of the Atlantic. The five survivors have a combined age of 357, meaning that some of the more slapstick sketches, such as The \"Ministry of Silly Walks\" could prove difficult for their aging bodies. But there may be more shows, \"depending on how long Eric and Mike live for.\" Jones paid tribute to Chapman, who died in 1989, saying, \"we'll miss him a lot although he will be appearing with us on stage in films.\" \"We've told (Chapman) that he'll be on. If there's a God, he'll turn up,\" Idle added. CNN's Susannah Cullinane, Peter and David Wilkinson contributed to this report.\n### Response :", "target": "Surviving Monty Python stars to reunite for a show in London next July .\nTickets will go on sale on Monday, priced from \u00c2\u00a327 .\nJohn Cleese says show will have some new material, but many old bits .\nMonty Python troups produced 45 TV episodes and five feature films .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?\n### Input :(CNN) -- The Renault Formula One team have agreed to pay damages to their former driver Nelson Piquet Jr. and his ex-world champion father after accusing the pair of lying in the controversial \"crashgate\" affair. Renault have confirmed on their official website that they were wrong to issue a press release in September 2009, in which they claimed the Piquets had lied by suggesting the team had forced Piquet Jr. to deliberately crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. At the time, Piquet Jr. stated he was ordered to crash by team bosses in order to help teammate Fernando Alonso win the race. And when the case was heard by the World Motor Sport Council, Renault were handed a two-year suspended F1 ban, enabling the pair to sue for libel in British courts. Admitting they libeled the duo, a Renault statement read: \"The team accepts -- as it did before the World Motor Sport Council -- that the allegations made by Nelson Piquet Junior were not false. \"It also accepts that Mr Piquet Junior and his father did not invent these allegations in order to blackmail the team into allowing him to drive for them for the remainder of the 2009 season. \"As a result, these serious allegations contained in our press release were wholly untrue and unfounded, and we withdraw them unequivocally. \"We would like to apologise unreservedly to Mr Piquet Junior and his father for the distress and embarrassment caused as a result. \"As a mark of the sincerity of our apology and regret, we have agreed to pay them a substantial amount of damages for libel as well as their costs, and have undertaken not to repeat these allegations at any time in the future. The Piquets' lawyer, Dominic Crossley, said in a statement that Renault had apologized in court for their treatment of the pair. \"They were both treated appallingly by Renault F1 when they dared to reveal the scandal to the governing body, and Nelsinho was abused terribly throughout his absurdly short career in F1,\" Crossley said. \"It is to the immense credit of both my clients that they have refused to be deterred from righting the wrongs despite the ferocity of the attacks and the size of the opponents they have had to confront. \"Nelson Piquet dominated F1 during the early 80s and his reputation as a motorsport legend should remain untarnished by this saga.\"\n### Response:", "target": "Renault F1 agree to pay damages to former driver Nelson Piquet Jr. and his father .\nThe team admitted they were wrong in accusing the pair of lying in a press release .\nPiquet Jr. revealed THAT team bosses ordered him to crash during the 2008 Singapore GP .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?\n### Input:LONDON, England (CNN) -- The days are getting shorter, the nights colder, but that doesn't mean that your electricity bill needs to go through the roof. In a unique experiment, the residents of Britain's Scilly Isles are hoping to show that reducing your electricity consumption doesn't have to be difficult. The Isles of Scilly is switching off power to promote energy efficiency. As part of E-Day, homes, schools and businesses on the Scilly Isles are switching off all non-essential electrical equipment to promote energy saving. The results of the experiment are being posted online in real-time. E-Day organizer, Matt Prescott said: \"The Isles of Scilly are like a miner's canary for the rest of the UK, because of their vulnerability to sea level rise, to violent storms rolling off the Atlantic and to any major changes in the Gulf Stream.\" The islands, which lie 28 miles off Land's End, the UK's most westerly point, are connected to the UK mainland by a single electricity cable which means that power usage in the experiment can be measured efficiently. All of the 2000-strong community who are spread across five islands have been encouraged to join in. The energy savings made will be compared against the previous day's usage with updates appearing online regularly. The E-Day Web site keeps track of costs and kWh usage providing up-to-the-minute information about how much electricity is being used in island-wide as well as individually monitoring Five Islands School on St Mary's Island and the electricity consumption of one family. \"We've fitted the family and the school with special energy monitors so they can accurately monitor what appliances use the most electricity,\" Prescott told CNN. Studies suggest that families who use these sorts of energy monitors can cut their electricity bills by up to 20 percent. At the time of writing, the family's consumption had dropped dramatically, down 35 percent on the previous day, which Prescott estimates is a saving of around \u00a3300 ($475) on their annual electricity bill. Sadly the figures for the school and the island as a whole weren't quite so impressive. The school was up six percent on the previous day, while the island as a whole saw a two percent rise in usage. Prescott put these small rises down to the notoriously fickle British weather. \"Yesterday was lovely and sunny,\" he said. \"So far, today it has been rainy.\" The damp and gloom have meant more lights being switched on but despite these meteorological setbacks, Prescott remained upbeat about the success of the experiment. \"Before the family left home this morning they turned off everything they could, so their reduction in usage is a fantastic result,\" he said. Visitors to the the E-Day Web site can also play the\"5 Things\" game to find out what all sorts of household appliances cost to run and how much they cost you and the environment. \"The E-Day experiment will hopefully prove that the small things can make a big difference, especially when we work together and try to save energy,\" Prescott said. Prescott is also the founder of \"Ban the Bulb\" -- an energy efficiency campaign which is helping phase out the use of incandescent light bulbs in 30 countries. The event has been organized as part of a four-day Earth Summit event which has seen the Isles of Scilly play host to fellow islanders from Samoa, The Galapagos Islands, Madagascar and the Carteret Islands -- whose inhabitants are some of the first people being displaced by rising sea-levels.\n### Response :", "target": "UK's Scilly Isles take part in a day-long experiment monitoring electricity consumption .\nIslanders being encouraged to switch off all non-essential electrical appliances .\nE-Day is the culmination of a four-day  long Earth Summit on the islands .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction: Could you highlight the primary messages?Cunning wolf? Working class hero? Or bland Beijing loyalist? C.Y. Leung, the Hong Kong leader whose resignation has become a rallying cry for the protesters that have filled the city's streets this week, was a relative unknown before he took the top job in 2012. As the son of a policeman who has used the same briefcase since his student days, his supporters said he would improve the lot of ordinary people in a city that has one of the world's widest wealth gaps. \"He wanted to present himself as someone from the grassroots, not linked to the tycoons... but people have been terribly disappointed,\" says Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science at City University of Hong Kong. It's Leung's failure to make progress on the universal suffrage that was promised to the city under the terms of its 1997 handover to China that has rankled Hong Kongers most, bringing tens of thousands of them onto the streets in recent days. Beijing lackey? One of his nicknames is \"689\" --  a sarcastic reference to the number of votes he obtained from the city's 1,200-strong election committee, a group of people selected from the largely pro-Beijing elite. And Leung, a former surveyor and real estate consultant, has done little to dispel the prevailing view that he is Beijing's lackey. A day after being elected as chief executive he paid a visit to the central government liaison office, Beijing's outpost in the city and he was the first leader to make his inauguration speech in Mandarin -- rather than the Cantonese that is spoken by most people in this former British colony. \"He is in daily communication with Beijing,\" says Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \"C.Y. is a very obedient cadre.\" Despite this, Leung was not in fact Beijing's first choice to become chief executive. The early favorite was Henry Tang, a  bumbling former financial secretary best known for his penchant for red wine. But revelations that Tang's home had an enormous basement which hadn't been approved for planning permission, dubbed an underground palace, derailed his campaign. However, it was later discovered that Leung's home in the city's exclusive Peak neighborhood also had an illegal structure. Leung declared ignorance but it undermined trust in the city's new leader from the get-go and helped earn him another nickname -- \"wolf.\" The moniker sounds similar in Cantonese to his family name but also suggests a cunning political operator. His approval ratings have plummeted since 2012 and a plush toy wolf made by IKEA sold out across the city earlier this year as Hong Kongers, eager to use it as a tongue-in-cheek symbol of protest, snapped it up. A gigantic, enlarged effigy of Leung's head, replete with lupine fangs, has also been a distinctive sight on the streets during the protests. Villain? For all his colorful nicknames, Harry Harrison, political cartoonist at the South China Morning Post, the city's main English-language newspaper, says Leung is a difficult character to portray. \"C.Y., despite his pantomime villain appearance, hasn't really turned out to be all that cartoonable,\" he told CNN.  \"I've hardly featured him in any cartoons for months now.\" Those that do usually feature Leung sitting in his office with a picture of malevolent panda -- symbolizing China -- behind him. The reason, says Harrison, is that Leung is rarely out and about and has little public presence, coming across as aloof. His unease with ordinary members of the public has been on display this week. Leung has only appeared in public three times; twice for press conferences and once for a National Day flag-raising ceremony attended by dignitaries. Protest leaders have repeatedly called for him to go and refuse to negotiate with him, preferring a meeting with his number two -- Carrie Lam. While Leung says he will not resign, many observers feel his days are numbered, with protesters setting up a makeshift tomb at the protest site. \"Beijing would ... lose face if they were to sack Leung in the near future,\" says Lam at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. But \"it's a foregone conclusion that C.Y. Leung has to go because he is a very divisive and very unpopular figure.\"\n### Response:", "target": "C.Y.

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the central ideas presented?WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has blocked further consideration of a federal law designed to keep sexual material from underage users of the Web. The justices without comment Wednesday rejected an appeal from the federal government to reinstate the Child Online Protection Act (COPA), passed by Congress in 1998. The high court and subsequent federal courts said the law -- which has never taken effect -- had serious free speech problems. The Bush administration was a strong supporter of the law and the Justice Department led the fight in court to revive it. The justices issued their ruling a day after all nine were on hand for the inauguration of President Barack Obama. Retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor also attended the ceremony. The case tested the free speech rights of adults against the power of Congress to control Internet commerce. The Supreme Court twice ruled against COPA, arguing that it represented government censorship rather than lawful regulation of adult-themed pornography businesses. The law would have prevented private businesses from creating and distributing \"harmful\" content that minors could access on the Internet. Free speech advocates said adults would be barred access to otherwise legal material and that parental-control devices and various filtering technology are less intrusive ways to protect children. The high court in 2004 upheld a preliminary injunction against the law and sent the case back to lower courts for consideration of the arguments. In their opinion at the time, the 5-4 majority concluded COPA \"likely violates the First Amendment.\" \"The government has not shown that the less restrictive alternatives proposed ... should be disregarded,\" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the 2004 decision. \"Those alternatives, indeed, may be more effective\" than the law passed by Congress. \"Filters are less restrictive\" he said, and thus pose less risk of muzzling free speech. \"They impose selective restrictions on speech at the receiving end, not universal restrictions at the source.\" He added, \"There is a potential for extraordinary harm and a serious chill upon protected speech\" if the law takes effect.\" In reconsidering the law, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, again ruled the law unconstitutional.\n### Response : ", "target": "Justices reject appeal to reinstate the Child Online Protection Act .\nCOPA violates the First Amendment right to free speech, justices say .\nCOPA would have kept businesses from distributing \"harmful\" content to minors .\nIn 2004 ruling, justice said parental filters are less restrictive on free speech .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The new wedding rules . If Martha Stewart says so, it must be true! Gone is the era of the cookie-cutter wedding; you can celebrate your own way. Forget the \"have tos\" and \"shoulds\" about nuptials. There are no hard-and-fast rules. Except one: Be a gracious bride and groom while letting your true style shine. 9. Wedding etiquette: To keep or to toss? Good manners are always in style, but points of wedding etiquette can be safely wrapped up and tucked away in the attic without the world crumbling to dust and guests rending their garments and wailing. Matrimony editor Kat Kinsman took a look at traditional wedding practices from which we may now part. 8. I do ... cost a lot: Weddings by the numbers . All you need is love, right?

Kinsman took a look at marriage customs from around the globe. 4. Wedding photos: When snap-happy guests go too far . 2013 was, no doubt, the most documented wedding year yet. From Twitter to Instagram to Facebook, guests and wedding party members alike posted images straight from the scene, sometimes using hashtags and apps so interested parties could follow along. But some of them took it a bit too far, getting in the way of professional photographers and turning a personal event into a public spectacle.

They'll even get legally hitched in the eyes of the government -- but not before a higher power in which they don't believe. This can cause some upset for friends and relatives accustomed to church weddings, or at least a verse from Corinthians. Grinberg spoke with experts and atheist couples about how to prepare guests for a secular ceremony. 1. I now pronounce me ... broke .

A federal judge's opinion includes side-by-side photos of the key players in The Naked Cowboy case. When I wrote in April that the lawsuit filed by Robert Burck \"may be the end of the era of the \"naked\" cowboy and predicted he would be able to afford some \"very nice duds,\" my fellow lawyers laughed at me. One close friend -- let's call him Larry -- said as he snickered, \"I read your article. You can't be serious. You really think that the Naked Cowboy is going to cash in? Well, I predict he is going to get thrown out of court. If he doesn't, maybe I will start walking around my office in my tighty whities.\" Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Denny Chin didn't throw the cowboy from his steed. In fact, in a lengthy decision, Judge Chin ruled against the makers of M&Ms, rejecting Mars, Inc.'s attempt to dismiss the Cowboy's lawsuit. And it seems that Judge Chin has a sense of humor. On the first page of his decision, the judge pasted photos of the litigating parties side by side and wrote,  \"This is the case of The Naked Cowboy versus The Blue M&M.\" And what a case it is. Burck sued Mars in April for $6 million in federal court in New York. The central allegation: trademark infringement under the Lanham Act, arising from a video billboard for M&Ms. Most people, and maybe Mars, thought the Cowboy was just a kooky street entertainer dressed in his underwear. However, I've spoken to Mr. Cowboy, I mean, Mr. Burke, and he didn't seem kooky to me at all. In fact, he seemed kinda smart. Even Judge Chin recognized that The Naked Cowboy is no ordinary street entertainer. Although he performs in New York City's Times Square in little more than underwear and a smile, he has registered trademarks to \"The Naked Cowboy\" name and likeness. And he doesn't just sing in Times Square. He has a Web site http://www.nakedcowboy.com/ with his modeling photos and has a link to nakedcowboy.tv. You can download his music on iTunes. You can buy his tighty whities from his online store for $15. He even has a podcast. Judge Chin observed that \"Burck has appeared as The Naked Cowboy in various television shows, movies, and video games. He has also licensed his name and likeness to companies for endorsements and advertisements. He even appeared in a Chevrolet commercial that aired during Super Bowl XLI. Judge Chin then explained that \"beginning in April 2007, Mars began running an animated cartoon advertisement on two oversized video billboards in Times Square, featuring a blue M&M dressed \"exactly like The Naked Cowboy,\" wearing only a white cowboy hat, cowboy boots, and underpants, and carrying a guitar.\" And get this -- the video \"played on a continuous loop every few minutes over a nine-month period.\" Mars tried to defend itself by arguing that the Blue M&M was just a parody of the Cowboy and was protected under the First Amendment. Although imitation is supposed to be the sincerest form of flattery, Judge Chin didn't agree with M&M's parody argument. Rather, Judge Chin thought it was a question for a jury to decide and wrote that the complaint \"plausibly argues that consumers would believe that the M&M Cowboy characters were promoting a product rather than merely parodying The Naked Cowboy, and that viewers would believe that The Naked Cowboy had endorsed M&Ms.\" Then Judge Chin ordered the lawyers to appear in his courtroom for a pretrial conference on July 11 at noon. High Noon. That Judge Chin makes me laugh. Round One to the Cowboy.

{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given text.(CNN) -- A Swedish SWAT team backed by local police arrested four people overnight on suspicion of plotting terror attacks, the Swedish Security Service told CNN Sunday. The four were held in the city of Gothenburg for \"probable cause\" of preparing the attacks, the highest level of suspicion in Sweden, said Sara Kvarnstrom, a spokeswoman for the security force. She refused to say whether the suspects had been under surveillance or if the arrests resulted from a tip-off, saying she could not discussed details on an ongoing investigation. \"Through these arrests we have been able to prevent a situation from occurring,\" Malena Rembe, head analyst at the Swedish Security Service, told CNN affiliate TV4. Sweden is not raising its terror threat level -- which is currently at 3, with 5 as the highest -- and there is \"no reason for the public to be alarmed,\" she said. \"These arrests have not changed this threat level,\" Kvarnstrom added. An art gallery in central Gothenburg was evacuated shortly before midnight local time, police said, but declined to say whether it was connected to the arrests. A party was going on at the Roda Sten gallery at the time, with about 500 people attending the inauguration of an arts festival, according an interview with a witness in Goteborgs Posten, a local newspaper. The police cordon was removed at 6 a.m. local time, said Ulf Edberg, a spokesman for Gothenburg police. Police have a \"number of extra police officers\" on the streets of Gothenburg, Edberg said. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Hilding Qvarnstrom, said in a statement on the prosecution authority's website that the investigation is still at an early stage and authorities cannot reveal any details about the arrests. The head of the Swedish Security Service, Anders Danielsson, warned last week that \"Islamic terrorism is still the biggest threat against Sweden.\" \"But it is different today,\" he said, calling it \"more complex and unpredictable, both in terms of who could be a target and how they can strike.\" Al Qaeda is now encouraging Muslim radicals to stay home \"and strike where they are,\" rather than traveling to conflict zones to get experience, said Rembe of the Swedish Security Service. \"When individuals with those kind of ideologies act on their own it becomes harder to make a threat assessment,\" she warned. Stockholm was hit by a suicide bombing in December. The attack on the capital, Sweden's first suicide bombing, wounded two people in a district full of Christmas shoppers. And police arrested two people in Gothenburg, the country's second-largest city, on suspicion of plotting a bombing in October. They were later released without charge, police said. After the Stockholm bombing, Swedish Security Police said the country had almost 200 Islamic extremists who advocate violence, but said there was no indication their number is growing. The police study was commissioned months before the attack in Stockholm. The extremist threat isn't widespread, according to the report, which the government commissioned in February 2010. \"The threat from violence-promoting Islamic extremism in Sweden is currently not a threat to the fundamental structures of society, Sweden's democratic system or central government,\" the summary said. But the radicals are capable of damage, police said. \"While violence-promoting Islamist extremist groups do not pose a threat to Swedish society, they are still a threat to individuals and groups, especially in other countries,\" the report said. The police analysis highlighted the disturbing trend of increasing foreign travel by the radicals. \"The most serious potential threat to Sweden is the long-term effects of people from Sweden choosing to travel abroad to join violence-promoting Islamic extremist groups,\" the police said. \"There are currently no signs of falling interest in joining foreign groups.\" Swedish authorities are investigating involvement in radicalism by Taimour Abdulwahab, the weekend's suicide bomber. His emails before the bombings said that one reason for the attack was Sweden's tolerance of Lars Vilks' newspaper cartoon of the prophet Mohammed as a dog, authorities said. Abdulwahab, 28 -- who had lived in Iraq, Sweden and the English town of Luton -- also cited the presence of Swedish troops in Afghanistan. That cartoon of Mohammed, published in 2007, was also cited in the new report as an example \"of local events that may fuel radicalism globally.\" Sweden's radical networks are typically made up of males between 15 and 30 years of age, with varying backgrounds, most of whom were born or grew up in Sweden, the report said. Several women are also involved, sharing the violence-promoting ideology, but they don't engage directly in security-threatening activities, the police said. At least 80% of the radicals are socially connected, mainly through friendships and the Internet, but the social ties don't make them \"one coherent network capable of fully coordinating its resources and working towards the same goal,\" the report said. Swedish terrorism expert Magnus Ranstorp said that before the December bombing, Sweden thought it was \"immune\" to terror attacks. \"Even (Osama) bin Laden said in early 2003, 2004, that if every country was like Sweden, there would be no terrorism,\" Ranstorp said. Police called upon civic leaders as well as the Swedish Muslim community to prevent and counter extremism, and they encouraged the public to develop a deeper knowledge of Islam. Though they shouldn't feel a greater responsibility to do so, practicing Muslims and their clerics could be helpful in countering \"violence-promoting propagandists active in Sweden and abroad,\" the report said.

{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.While House Republicans say every option -- including a government shutdown -- is on the table to counter President Barack Obama's planned executive action on immigration, Colorado Sen.-elect Cory Gardner said shutting down the government is something a \"mature governing body\" shouldn't even consider. \"There's no time, place or purpose of a government shutdown or default,\" Gardner said Friday on MSNBC's Morning Joe. \"That's simply ridiculous and something that a mature governing body doesn't even contemplate. We ought to make it very clear that that's simply not acceptable.\" Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said shutting down the government or defaulting on the U.S.'s debt obligations are completely off the table. But House Speaker John Boehner has been under pressure from the conservative faction of his caucus to tie the President's executive actions to the fate of the government spending bill needed to fund federal agencies by mid-December. On Friday, Gardner, currently a member of the House, said members of Congress need to work together and with the President to make comprehensive immigration reform a reality. Gardner said Republicans should counter the president's planned action with a plan of their own. \"To simply say no to everything is unacceptable,\" Gardner said. \"But I think the President also needs to do the right thing and work with Congress.\" Could immigration cause another government shutdown? Asked about reports that Republicans could consider suing the President over his coming executive order, Gardner urged more bipartisanship, which he suggested was the message voters sent at the polls this month. \"Instead of charging each other with lawsuits or litigation or executive orders or abuses of powers, why don't we actually do what the American people sent us to do. Let's work together, let's be the grownups in the room. That's what they hope that Washington is,\" Gardner said. While the midterm results appeared to bring Obama and GOP leaders in Congress to the table -- and in fact did as they lunched together at the White House -- the spirit of bipartisanship appears to have already soured as Obama stood firm on his pledge to take executive action on immigration by the end of the year and following the announcement of a climate deal with China.\n### Response :", "target": "Rep.

In a statement, the Port Authority, which oversees the airport, called for \"an expedited review of the incident and a complete investigation to determine how Raytheon's perimeter intrusion detection system -- which exceeds federal requirements -- could be improved.

The provisional accord paves the way for a new autonomous region to be administered by Muslims in Mindanao, according to President Benigno Aquino III, who met with the rebels at the presidential palace in Manila. \"Today, we sign a framework agreement that can finally seal a genuine, lasting peace in Mindanao,\" Aquino said in a speech. The deal sets up mechanisms to tackle issues such as power structure and revenues in the southern region, which will be named Bangsamoro. The new region is expected to replace the current one by 2016, when the president's term ends, according to officials. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front has fought for decades to set up an independent Islamic state in southern Philippines, having been blamed for a host of attacks and skirmishes that have left tens of thousands dead. Yet even as this violence unfolded, rebels have been negotiating for 15 years with officials from the Manila-based government. Aquino has said the agreement \"brings all former secessionist groups into the fold,\" and that the Moro Islamic Liberation Front is no longer seeking to form a new nation. The rebel group's chairman, Al Haj Murad Ebrahim, was present at the agreement's signing. Murad's group is estimated to have 12,000 members, but military sources say it may have splintered when government troops conducted offensives in 2000.

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.\n### Input:(CNN) -- House Republican leaders announced Thursday they will not take action on a new farm bill until after the November elections -- a sign of sharp internal GOP divisions on a critical political issue for many members of Congress. \"We will deal with the farm bill after the election,\" said Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. \"The current situation that we face is we've got people who believe there's not enough reform in the farm bill that came out of (the House Agriculture) committee, (and) we've got others who believe that there's too much reform in the bill that came out of the committee.\" Boehner indicated GOP leaders do not believe they currently have the votes to pass either a short-term extension or a more comprehensive five-year measure. The current five-year law establishing various levels of federal support for farmers and ranchers -- now struggling with drought in many parts of the country -- expires September 30. A failure to pass a new law won't impact existing federal support in 2012, though it would have a significant impact on agricultural markets in 2013, according to Dale Moore, a public policy deputy at the American Farm Bureau Federation. While the Democratic-run Senate passed a comprehensive $969 billion replacement bill in June through a rare bipartisan 64-35 vote, numerous conservatives in the Republican-controlled House have balked at the overall price tag and rising cost of food stamps included in the measure. Several Farm Belt Republicans in tight political races this year, however, have pushed hard for quick legislative action on a five-year plan. North Dakota Rep. Rick Berg, a freshman House Republican running for retiring Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad's seat, told CNN Thursday he was \"frustrated with the Republican leadership.\" \"We have to get a five-year, long-term bill passed. I'm really disappointed,\" he said. \"Agriculture is one of our bright shining spots in America right now, and we don't need to put this cloud of uncertainty over it.\" Berg argued that GOP leaders should have allowed a full House vote on the Agriculture Committee measure. The committee's bill has a number of similarities to the Senate plan. Asked about the farm bill's legislative prospects in the post-election lame duck session of Congress, Berg said, \"I look back over history and this is more normal than not. ... I'm just doing everything I can do.\" Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson, the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Committee, told CNN there were \"10 different reasons\" why the House has so far failed to act. \"Some people think the food stamps are too high. Some people don't like the sugar program. Some people don't like the dairy program. Some people don't like the farm bill at all,\" he said. Peterson said he believes farm bill advocates will ultimately \"get a shot\" after the election. \"I think they're taking a (political) risk,\" he said in reference to the House Republicans. \"But they apparently don't think it's a problem.\" Moore told CNN that \"we can whine and complain all we want, but the bottom line is this segment of the game is over.

Mike Davis announced  the Global Witness decision Monday. \"We don't take this decision lightly, but we feel that we've now have reached a juncture where by continuing to participate we are inadvertently lending legitimacy to a scheme which is really misleading people in the diamond trade,\" he said. The decision follows the controversial sale of a batch of diamonds from the Marange diamond fields in Zimbabwe, some of which are owned by companies associated with President Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. Davis said the Mugabe government has to rely on diamond income because of the intense international pressure on it. \"Diamonds are an absolute godsend for them and a curse for the rest of Zimbabwe,\" he said. The Kimberley Process was developed in 2000 when a group of diamond-producing countries met in Kimberley, South Africa, to combat the trade in conflict diamonds.

{"source": "### Instruction:Read the paragraph below, then write a summary of it. \n### Input : (CNN) -- The iPad from Apple is the latest member of a new, multi-use generation of technology. It's a book, it's e-mail, it's your social network or your office, it's your music and your photos plus the apps for all of that. And the more ways we can use a device, the more we'll want to take a look at how using it affects those around us. In a nutshell, that's how \"old\" etiquette is applied to new technology. If you have an iPad, here are a few places you might find yourself: . First, be prepared for jealous looks, curious stares and questions from strangers. Don't break it out in public unless you're ready to play show and tell, and possibly share. \"Can I see it? Can I touch it? Can I try it?\" Know your answer, because like a proud momma with a new infant, all the old ladies will want to hold your baby. Have kids? Set the rules for use first thing. Tell them it's only for mommy's or daddy's work, or else be prepared to lose your latest spreadsheet when you walk in the door. Back at the office, think about your work culture. Will the iPad be a handy tool, Mr. Early Adopter, or overkill? Be explicit with colleagues about what you're using it for, such as taking notes or checking a calendar, so they don't think you're playing online Scrabble during your morning meeting. The reading feature is a huge component of iPad use, so feel free to pull it out during your morning commute. The upside: No more awkwardly folding your newspaper into a postage stamp. The downside? People are bound to read over your shoulder; until iPads are ubiquitous, curiosity will draw wandering eyes. When you're with your family, equate iPad reading to the same choices you make with your books and magazines. For example, if your family is watching \"So You Think You Can Dance\" but it isn't your thing, and you'd be reading a magazine during the show regardless, fire up the iPad. Just consider dimming it if the room is dark. But if the idea is to spend quality time interacting with your family, put it away. Even if you think you're paying attention, you won't look like it -- and that's all that's going to matter to your spouse. Without question, turn it off at the dinner table. Reading in bed is another time to think about dimming the iPad. Again, how will it affect others? If their light is out, it's time to dim. What about reading in the car? It's sad to have to spell this out, but never use it if you're the driver! Causing an accident is the ultimate rudeness, to say the least. You know what else is rude? Getting carsick. No matter how excited you are to read the latest updates on Twitter, the laws of physics still apply. Have an iron stomach? While catching up on \"CSI\" may be a good idea, using headphones might be a better one if you'll spoil it for the driver who can't watch. The internet abounds with free recipes, making the iPad handy in the kitchen. Greasy fingerprints on your new gadget aren't so nice, however. If you share your iPad with someone else, wipe it down after kitchen use. As for the bathroom, this debate may continue to rage as it does now for magazines. But since the iPad's resting place in your home isn't likely to be the back of the toilet, this is the one time treating it like a magazine isn't such a hot idea. The iPhone has already created a debate with its access to answers anywhere, anytime. Need to know the capital of Bolivia to win an argument at the dinner table? Pulling out your iPad may win you the debate, but trumping others this way may come off a bit know-it-all. Then again, it could be a huge success. The point of etiquette? Know your audience, and think before you trump. Technology and etiquette have a fascinating intersection. Etiquette lets people know how to act in common -- and sometimes uncommon -- situations, and how to expect others to react. But the pace of technology is blazingly fast and creates new situations daily. So we have to apply a basic tenet of etiquette -- be considerate of those around us -- to constantly adapt to how we, as a society, want to use technology. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anna Post.\n### Response :", "target": "When taking out your iPad, be prepared for jealous looks, curious stares and questions .\nFree recipes make the iPad handy in the kitchen, but greasy fingerprints aren't nice .\nHave kids?

{"source": "### Instruction :What are the central ideas presented?London (CNN) -- An autopsy to determine what killed singer Amy Winehouse will not be scheduled before Monday morning, London's Metropolitan Police said Sunday. \"Inquiries continue into the circumstances of the death,\" police said in a statement.  At this stage, the 27-year-old's death \"is being treated as unexplained and there have been no arrests in connection with the incident,\" police said. The singer, beloved for her talent but infamous for erratic public behavior, arrests and drug problems, was found dead at her apartment in London on Saturday, police and her publicist confirmed. Winehouse's family said in a statement Sunday it \"has been left bereft by the loss of Amy, a wonderful daughter, sister, niece. She leaves a gaping hole in our lives. We are coming together to remember her and we would appreciate some privacy and space at this terrible time.\" \"We are trying to come to terms with the death of a dear friend and colleague, the most amazing artist and talent,\" her management company, Metropolis Music, said Sunday. \"We will always remember Amy as a vibrant, funny, caring young woman who made everyone around her feel welcome. We have lost a very special person, part of our family.\" Winehouse's soulful, throaty vocals brought the British musician stardom in 2007, but her troubled off-stage life -- chronicled in her Top 10 hit \"Rehab\" -- won her notoriety. Her death came less than two months after her latest release from a rehabilitation program and weeks after she was booed offstage by disappointed fans in Serbia. Winehouse died at the same age as four other music legends. Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison each died of drug overdoses when they were 27. Kurt Cobain was 27 when he committed suicide, soon after his release from rehab. Police were called to Winehouse's Camden Square apartment just after 4 p.m. Saturday in response to report of \"a woman found deceased,\" police said. \"Everyone who is involved with Amy is shocked and devastated,\" Winehouse spokesman Chris Goodman said.  \"Our thoughts are with her family and friends.\" Her father, MItch, got word of his daughter's death Saturday while in New York preparing for a Monday night show with his band at the Blue Note club, his publicist said.  He immediately canceled the performance and caught a flight back to London, the publicist said. Winehouse's official website on Sunday carried nothing but a black-and-white photo of the singer. On Saturday, a statement on the site had said Winehouse was \"withdrawing from all scheduled performances.\" \"Rehab,\" in which she sang \"They tried to make me go to rehab, I said no, no, no,\" helped form the public's view of Winehouse. But she told CNN in a 2007 interview, \"I don't care enough about what people think of me to conform to anything.\" The London-born singer became a picture of a tattooed teenage rebel after she was expelled from a prestigious performing arts school. Her first album, \"Frank,\" debuted in 2003, when the singer-songwriter was 19. International success came with her 2007 album \"Back To Black.\"  She dominated the 2008 Grammys, winning five awards that night and delivering, via satellite from London, a strong performance of \"Rehab.\" Winehouse's volatile marriage to Blake Fielder-Civil took a toll on the singer's career. The couple divorced in 2009 after a stormy two years filled by drug addiction and arrests. Winehouse's parents went public with their efforts to help their daughter, telling the London Telegraph in 2009 that she was on the road to recovery. \"A gradual recovery, which is good,\" Winehouse's father told the Telegraph. \"With slight backward steps -- not drug backward steps, more drink backward steps if you follow my drift. I think that will be the pattern of recovery.\" The organization that awards the Grammys issued a statement Saturday calling Winehouse \"a dynamic performer and musician who seamlessly blended rock, jazz, pop, and soul and created a sound all her own.\" \"Her rich, soulful and unique voice reflected her honest songwriting and earned her a devoted fan following, critical acclaim, and the genuine respect and admiration of her musical peers,\" the Recording Academy statement said.  \"She will forever be remembered for her immense talent, and her music will live on for generations to come. Our deepest sympathies go out to her family, friends, and fans during this difficult time.\" CNN's Bharati Naik, Denise Quan and Alan Duke contributed to this report.\n### Response : ", "target": "NEW: Winehouse's family says it \"has been left bereft by the loss of Amy\"\nAn autopsy will not be scheduled before Monday morning .\nThe death is being treated as \"unexplained\"\nHer official website Sunday morning carries only a black-and-white photo of her .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Eto'o added his second when converting a lofted pass from Lucio and completed his treble nine minutes from time when out-pacing the Werder defence after latching onto Wes Sneijder's pass, and rounding Wiese.

{"source": "### Instruction :Read the paragraph below, then write a summary of it. (CNN) -- Organized crime gangs are exploiting a new target for illegal profit: Medicare and Medicaid. Experienced in running drug, prostitution and gambling rings, crime groups of various ethnicities and nationalities are learning it's safer and potentially more profitable to file fraudulent claims with the federal Medicare program and state-run Medicaid plans. \"They're hitting us and hitting us hard,\" said Timothy Menke, head of investigations for the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services. \"Organized crime involvement in health care fraud is widespread.\" One hot spot for health care fraud is Los Angeles, California, where Russian, Armenian and Nigerian gangs have been caught by federal agents. Recent cases include crime boss Konstantin Grigoryan, a former Soviet army colonel who pleaded guilty to taking $20 million from Medicare. Karapet \"Doc\" Khacheryan, boss of a Eurasian crime gang, was recently convicted with five lieutenants of stealing doctor identities in a $2 million scam. Two Nigerians, Christopher Iruke and his wife, Connie Ikpoh, were charged October 15 with bilking Medicare of $6 million dollars by fraudulently billing the government for electric wheelchairs and other expensive medical equipment. The two, allegedly members of an organized crime ring, entered pleas of not guilty and are being held in a federal detention center. \"They deny any allegations of wrongdoing,\" said their attorney, James Kosnett. Defrauding government-run health care programs involves stealing two types of identities: those of doctors, who bill for services, and patients, whose beneficiary numbers entitle them to medical care and necessary equipment. Criminals are expert at collecting both. Watch doctor tell what happened when his identity was stolen . \"That information is very, very valuable to these crooks. And the doctor may work at one clinic but he won't know about the second and third clinic that they've already set up using his identification,\" said Glenn Ferry, special agent in charge of the Los Angeles region for the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. \"They are definitely well-organized, well-schooled on how to commit Medicare fraud.\" Dr. Gianfranco Burdi had his identity stolen when he was recruited to join what appeared to be a new medical practice near Koreatown in Los Angeles. After the managers failed to show a business license and proof of malpractice insurance, Burdi pulled out. Two years later, the FBI came calling. Agents questioned Burdi, a psychiatrist, about whether he had prescribed $800,000 worth of electric wheelchairs for Medicare patients. \"I said no. I am a psychiatrist. Why would I prescribe an electric wheelchair?\" said Burdi. \"It was shocking.\" A jury found Leonard Uchenna Nwafor guilty of using Burdi's identification to bill Medicare for medically unnecessary durable medical equipment. \"I was naive enough to provide them my medical license, my other data,\" said Burdi. Patient beneficiary numbers are easy to buy along Los Angeles' Skid Row. Impoverished residents of shelters there tell CNN they've accepted cash from recruiters -- known as \"cappers\" -- to go to bogus medical clinics where they share what they call their \"red, white and blue\" -- the tri-colored Medicare card that has a beneficiary number for billing the government. \"People down here need to eat. Somebody who comes up on a quick hustle, quick money, they going to jump on. I'm one of them, I will,\" said a man who identified himself as Scott. \"They're just defrauding the patients, defrauding the government.\" Jimmy Rodgers of San Bernadino, California, tells CNN he went to a clinic three times a week, receiving $100 per visit but little medical care. \"This is just like Carte Blanche,\" said Rodgers, holding his Medicare card. \"Matter of fact, better than Carte Blanche. Carte Blanche has limitations on it.\" The clinics, he concedes, were clearly fronts for collecting beneficiary data. \"They were no doctors. They were just somebody who had their hand out,\" said Rodgers, who later cooperated with federal investigators. \"And they just ripping the system off and using me as a means to rip the system off.\" Once criminals have doctor and patient identification numbers, they begin filing false claims. The Khacheryan gang told Medicare that health services were being provided on the 10th floor at 754 South Los Angeles Street. But there is no doctor's office in that decrepit industrial building -- only a mail drop, where the Khacheryan group collected checks from the U.S. government for hundreds of thousands of dollars. The inspector general's office of the Department of Health and Human Services estimates it is on track to recover about $4 billion this year by breaking up health care fraud schemes perpetrated by all types of criminals, from organized rings to corrupt doctors. That amount, though, is only about 5 percent of the annual health care fraud cost in the United States, according to the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association. Because government health programs operate on the honor system, law enforcement officials say it's easy for organized crime rings and average criminals to cash in at the taxpayer's expense.\n### Response : ", "target": "Gangs make millions by getting ID numbers of doctors, patients .\nThen they file fraudulent Medicare, Medicaid claims for care that never happened .\nOne doctor had his ID stolen, learned it was used to bill $800,000 for wheelchairs .\nGovernment to recover  $4 billion this year -- but that's just 5 percent of fraud cost .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?(CNN) -- When the Republican National Convention kicks off this week in Tampa, Florida, the nation will notice one thing before anything else: This is not your father's or grandfather's Republican Party. Rather, it's a party with leaders as diverse as the country it intends to represent. With the nation's changing demographics, Republicans can no longer rely on the South and Midwest to carry them to victory in 2012. Instead, they must broaden their base into traditionally purple and blue states. It's an uphill battle: President Obama leads by a sizeable margin with women and by wide margins with Latino and black voters. But it's not insurmountable. Romney already leads with men by roughly the same number President Obama leads with women. Nor is it unprecedented. Republicans won a landslide victory in the 2010 fall midterm elections. Now they must devise a strategy to repeat that. Republicans, in short, must repeat what they did in their landslide victory in the 2010 fall midterm elections. Opinion: Unfriendly to women? Not my GOP . Bolstered by the rise of the Tea Party, Republicans won back the House in historic fashion then. Independents went to Republicans by 15 points, an incredible 23-point swing from 2008. Republicans virtually eliminated the gender gap with women -- their best showing since 1982. Writing in The Wall Street Journal this week, Michael Barone notes, \"White noncollege voters and white evangelical Christians were only 42% and 37%, respectively, of the winning Republican coalition in the 2010 congressional elections.\" 2010 was a watershed year for Republicans because they were able to lure away much of the Democratic base, particularly Northern and Midwestern suburbanites and college graduates. They did so by campaigning on major policy issues and reforms, such as Obamacare and the national debt, that inspired and enthused the electorate. As the 2012 Republican convention dawns, look for Republicans to display a similar election strategy: a diverse cast of party leaders with bold policy ideas reaching for a diverse electorate. For one of the few times in GOP history, the top of the Republican ticket hails exclusively from the North, with Mitt Romney from Michigan and Paul Ryan from Wisconsin. The de facto leaders of the GOP bring a newfound party interest in these traditionally blue states. Already, Ryan has put Wisconsin in play for Republicans in some of the latest polls. In Michigan, which President Barack Obama won by more than 16 points in 2008, Romney trails Obama by only 2 points, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls in Michigan. The nation is familiar with the likes of Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor, but in Tampa, viewers will be introduced to a new, even deeper and more diverse cast. Scheduled to speak Tuesday night is Ted Cruz, Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas. The son of a Cuban immigrant, Cruz rose to attend Princeton University and Harvard Law, becoming a gifted orator. As the solicitor general of Texas, he argued and won high-profile cases in front of the Supreme Court. Also speaking on Tuesday night is Nikki Haley, the first female governor in South Carolina and the daughter of Sikh immigrants. She made her name as governor fighting the Obama administration's National Labor Relations Board lawsuit challenging Boeing's right to build a new plant in South Carolina. The NLRB dropped the suit after the union reached an agreement with Boeing. The plant could bring thousands of jobs to her state. Opinion: GOP -- big tent, or big mess? With the reshuffled convention schedule, also speaking Tuesday will be Mia Love, the mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, and candidate for the 4th Congressional District there. Love, the first black female mayor in Utah state history, is already making a name for herself with her outspoken, firebrand conservatism. Susana Martinez, the first female governor of New Mexico and the first female Hispanic governor in U.S. history, is set to take the stage Wednesday night. More important than diversity, however, is substance, and this year's crop of Republican leaders is a bolder, more conservative group than we've seen in decades. After paying a steep price at the polls in 2006 and 2008, the Republican Party might be in a new era in 2012, one ripe with intrepid, limited government and Constitutional reformers such as Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Chris Christie of New Jersey, Bob McDonnell of Virginia and Rep. Ryan, now the vice presidential nominee. The purpose of a convention, after all, is to coalesce individuals into parties and ideas into causes. With the selection of Ryan for vice president, the race takes on clear shape and focus -- repealing Obamacare, restoring fiscal sanity and jump-starting the economy -- that voters can rally for, rather than just rallying against President Barack Obama. For all the hand-wringing and second-guessing in the Republican primaries, the post-convention GOP will take on a new, united face. The goal, inevitably, is to replicate the results of the GOP's 2010 landslide victory. But to do that, it must replicate the same vision, clarity and diversity, not for diversity's sake, but for the sake of the wide swath of America's voters in need of help. Look for the GOP to harness, focus and refine that message all week in Tampa.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the main idea?\n### Input: (CNN) -- On January 12, I went to basketball practice and then spent time with a kids' basketball league. The whole time my phone was in the car. When I finally looked at it, I had about 50 messages saying, \"Have you been watching the news about Haiti?\" It still haunts me to think that, as I went about my business that day, my homeland shuddered, crashed, and crumbled. More than 220,000 of my fellow Haitians died. Another 1.6 million were instantly left homeless -- most with nothing but the clothes on their backs. About 800,000 of them are children. Haiti has never been an easy place to be a kid. When I was growing up in Port-au-Prince, I felt lucky because I always had at least one meal a day. Some of my friends were starving. But we all shared what we had with each other. We figured out ways to have fun with nothing but a small patch of dirt to play in. We got along with very little, and we told ourselves that -- if we got just the slightest opportunity -- we would grab onto it and use it to do great things. That is what Haiti's children need now. They need opportunity. They need our help. It is amazing what kids can endure. Haiti's children have held the hands of parents as they lay crushed and dying beneath rubble. They've lost families, best friends, homes, schools. They can survive all that. But they can't thrive without us stepping up. Right after the earthquake, the immediate and enormous generosity from people in the U.S. made such a difference in Haiti -- and it made me very proud to be part of this huge-hearted nation. Organizations like UNICEF, which I have partnered with for years through my Samuel Dalembert Foundation, were able to provide emergency relief that stopped another wave of disaster in the form of disease and starvation. In the last six months, UNICEF has been providing water, food, shelter, immunizations, medicines, child protection, and education supplies to hundreds of thousands of Haitian children and their families. But in many ways, the hard work is just beginning. And the need remains huge. Those 1.6 million people left homeless are still living in tents and makeshift shelters -- and hurricane season is fast approaching. More than one third of the spontaneous settlements that have been created lack adequate sanitation, and this can make kids ill and lead to major disease outbreaks. People in settlements still rely on water being trucked in every day, and many don't get enough considering the near 100-degree heat. Learn more about helping Haiti at Impact Your World . Education is going to make all the difference to Haiti's future. Given the opportunity to learn, the children who survived the earthquake will grow up to transform their nation and lead it towards prosperity. But before the earthquake, only four in ten kids went to school, and that number is even lower now. Teachers are also absent because so many lost their homes and are now displaced. I was lucky enough to get the opportunity I dreamed of as a child in Haiti. And I started my foundation because I wanted to give other kids that chance, too. It's my deep belief that those who are lucky enough to have success in this life should do something -- anything -- to help others. So I ask: Even if you've already been generous, don't forget Haiti now that it's dropped from the news headlines. Organizations like UNICEF are there for kids, but they need funds to rebuild schools, train teachers, set up feeding centers, immunize against disease, dig wells, install water pumps... There are hundreds of thousands of very resilient kids in Haiti who are surviving despite all they've been through. They can endure a lot. Parents dying. Living in tents in 100-degree weather and rainstorms. Hungry bellies. But we don't want a nation of kids just barely surviving -- we want a nation of leaders. Haiti's children can't become leaders if they don't go to school. They can't become leaders if they're so hungry they can't concentrate. Or if they have to spend their days selling sodas in the street to make a few pennies. They can't become leaders if the water they drink makes them chronically sick. Or if they never get the vaccines that will keep deadly diseases away. If you join me in giving Haiti's kids the opportunities they deserve, I can promise they will do great things. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Samuel Dalembert.\n### Response:", "target": "As Haiti recovers from January quake, children bear a heavy burden, says Samuel Dalembert .\nHe says it's important that kids not only survive, but are educated and kept healthy .\nDalembert recalls growing up poor in Haiti, sharing with friends who had less .\nHe and other kids vowed if they got any opportunity, they would use it to do great things, he says .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Give me a one line summary of the story below:(CNN) -- Africa has the second largest population of any continent but only accounts for 3% of global air traffic. The reasons for taking such a small share of the aviation market have been the same for decades: poor infrastructure, stalled liberalization, high taxes and fuel charges. It also struggles with a lack of routes linking cities, a lack of regular flights flying them and a lack of profitable airlines competing. However with the GDP of sub-Saharan countries expected to grow almost 6% this year, according to the World Bank, there is still the belief that aviation can really take-off. \"The infrastructuure is improving, which was one of the key issues,\" says Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of Air France. \"Airports, air traffic control, civil aviation regulations everywhere, they are improving, there are many programs coming from international organizations and there is an enormous need for air traffic coming directly from the economic growth.\" Read more: Are airline loyalty schemes worth it? The need for improved air travel across the continent is clear to many in the industry, where there are glaring gaps between growing economic centers. A flight between Cape Town in South Africa and Lagos, Nigeria, the second fastest growing city in Africa, should take six hours. Yet with no direct flights, the cheapest option via the Middle East takes up to 25 hours while the faster, yet more expensive routes within Africa still take ten hours. Often governments have been blamed for protecting their national carriers and refusing to deregulate the industry and open up the skies to greater competition. While South Africa has a number of liberalization agreements, its government agrees that more needs to be done . \"There is a number of constraints in different countries, with regard to policies, with regards to the regulatory environment... but in terms of the decisions themselves, we have taken the right ones,\" says Malusi Gigaba, South Africa's minister for public enterprise. \"Of course, you already have more foreign airlines flying in Africa than African airlines.... but we would like to see even greater cooperation between these African airlines.\" Kenyan Airways is one airline that is taking note. It recently suggested a merger with other local aviation big-hitters, South African Airways and Ethiopian Airways. Read more: Thefts on planes on the rise . \"We can't go on the way we have, we have got to start consolidating,\" says Titus Naikuni. \"We've all been talking to each other. I don't know if you call it a merger or whatever, (but it is) to avoid a situation where we're running two aircraft side by side at 50% capacity.\" If there's a criticism, it is that it is creating less competition on a continent that is crying out for more. The real winners so far have been international carriers, particularly from the Middle East, that now make up almost 60% of intercontinental traffic to and from Africa. Etihad Airways has routes from Abu Dhabi to major cities in Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and North African countries and then partners with domestic airlines to reach second and third tier cities. \"What we are doing is complementing each others networks...they can take us into 26 points in Africa they we'll never touch,\" says James Hogan, CEO of Etihad Airways. The greatest test to come then is if the quality of the air links outside the major hubs match the international routes. That will prove if African aviation can ever truly live up to its potential.\n### Response:", "target": "African airlines looking to code-share agreements to improve network .\nOnly 3% of global air travel is from Africa .\nMore international airlines fly to and from African than African airlines .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Produce an article summary of the following news article:Doc to summarize:\n### Input:Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, speaking to a gathering of gay and lesbian activists, said Saturday that he is committed to equality, citing the repeal of the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy as an example. Obama said his accomplishments on gay rights issues have been substantial since he last headlined the annual National Dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, in 2009. He acknowledged \"we have more work to do,\" including on the issue of bullying. The president currently supports same-sex civil unions, and has said his views on gay marriage are \"evolving.\" He recently announced his support of the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. Organizations working actively to legalize same-sex marriage say they hope Obama eventually changes his stance. While Obama spoke Saturday about equality, he did not speak on the marriage issue. The president chided participants in a Republican presidential debate last month for not rebuking members of the audience who booed a gay soldier who asked about the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" \"We don't believe in standing silent when that happens,\" Obama said of the debate incident. \"You want to be commander-in-chief, you can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States even when it is not politically convenient.\" After the debate, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said he hadn't heard the booing when the question was asked. Santorum was being asked the question when the incident occurred. Obama spoke of growing tolerance measured, he said, by ordinary Americans: . \"A father realizes he doesn't just love his daughter but also her wife.\" Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said after the speech that Obama reaffirmed commitment to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. \"It was a remarkable experience to see openly gay and lesbian uniformed service members in the audience be able to salute their commander in chief\" about the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" Obama's remarks were delivered to a key constituency that hasn't always been receptive to the president's policies and style of leadership. \"I'd like to see the president bring his message of support for the freedom to marry to a broader audience, perhaps in a conversational setting, so that all Americans can hear him talk about why marriage matters to loving gay and lesbian couples and their families,\" said Evan Wolfson, the founder and president of Freedom to Marry. \"It is important that the president lay out the case for Americans opening their hearts to the values of fairness and treating others as they would want to be treated.\" Wolfson, along with other organizations advocating for legal same-sex marriages, said the Obama administration had made significant progress on some issues, but that support for marriage equality was still an important goal. \"We applaud the administration's progress, while we also encourage him to 'evolve faster' on supporting full marriage equality,\" Stuart Gaffney, media director for Marriage Equality USA, said Saturday. He said he wasn't aware of any opposition within his organization to the HRC's selection of Obama as their keynote speaker. \"We look forward to the day soon when our president stands with that pro-equality majority,\" Gaffney added. The Log Cabin Republicans, an organization that represents gay and lesbian conservatives, said Obama's appearance Saturday night was more about politics than substantive policy change. \"President Obama's appearance at the Human Rights Campaign Dinner this evening is more emblematic of their role as an ostensibly partisan organization than a representation of the gay and lesbian community,\" said Christian Berle, the group's deputy executive director. Berle said Obama's stance on gay marriage didn't match that of most Americans. \"As all Americans are becoming open to marriage equality, the president is taking a retreat,\" Berle said. \"Instead he is turning to the gay community for money and applause. \"If the president wants to deserve all the money and adulation he has already received from the gay community, he should announce his firm support for everyone's freedom to marry,\" Berle said. Saturday's event was expected to draw 3,000 gay activists, and took place at a convention center in downtown Washington. The speech was streamed live online. A CNN/ORC International poll taken Sept. 9-11 showed 53% of Americans believe marriages between gay and lesbian couples should be considered valid. That number has steadily been rising in CNN/ORC International polls since 2008.

With a population of 8.8 million people, Mexico City is one of the most densely populated areas in the country and one of the richest cities in the world. It's also a huge attraction for soccer fans and bullfighting enthusiasts. From eating out any time of the night to enjoying a day in the \"Mexican Venice,\" or Xochimilco, to visiting the pyramids just outside the city, Talamantes says Mexico City is a constant surprise and delight. Here, he offers some insider tips on traveling to his hometown: . Where can you get the best view of the city? If you're downtown, go to the top of Torre Latinoamericana. It was the tallest skyscraper in Mexico City for many years. Now, it's kind of old but keeps its charm. If you're on Reforma, Mexico's most beautiful avenue, try to step into Piso 51 in Torre Mayor, the tallest skyscraper in Latin America. Beware: It is a private club, and you will be asked to join. Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion? Taberna del Le\u00f3n in Plaza Loreto offers traditional Mexican cuisine in a cozy environment. It's managed by M\u00f3nica Pati\u00f1o, the famous Mexican chef. Where is the best place to people watch? Try barrio La Condesa -- its streets are full of bars and restaurants attracting a very interesting crowd, especially on nights and weekends. Also, you can go to Emilio Castelar, a street in Polanco full of life and good-looking people. What is your favorite neighborhood? Why? Colonia Roma is becoming the \"Mexican Soho,\" with lots of galleries, restaurants, bars, boutique hotels, fountains and squares. It is antique, so you can find old buildings, but it's also transforming into a more modern area. It is close to La Condesa, which is also a very cool place, full of young people. What's the biggest misconception about your city? You won't believe how many trees are in the city. And the robberies aren't that common, either. Where do you go to relax? Espacio Escult\u00f3rico at the UNAM, Mexico's biggest university campus, offers a collection of sculptures by famous artists. That is a little farther south of the city. If you're not willing to travel that much, go into Bosque de Chapultepec's audiorama, where you can sit on a bench and listen to some good music. What essential thing should visitors see or experience if they have only a few hours? Go inside Museo de Antropolog\u00eda, which showcases the very DNA of Mexico. If you don't want to step into a museum, go downtown to see El Zocalo (Mexico City's main square) and Templo Mayor, the remains of an ancient Aztec temple. What's the biggest tourist trap? Is there a \"tourist trap\" that's actually worth seeing? The biggest tourist trap is Plaza Garibaldi, were the mariachis are awful and you can get mugged. A trap that could be worth seeing is the area called Xochimilco, often called \"Mexican Venice\" because of a series of canals. Where was your most memorable meal? Where's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town? Zinco bar, on Cinco de Mayo Street in downtown, has great jazz music and a very cheerful crowd. Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try? Not really. Just stick to the tacos and tequila as if you were any place in Mexico. If you want something fancy, try duck enchiladas in Izote restaurant on Avenue Presidente Masaryk, Mexico's most expensive street. What is a good local souvenir? Rag dolls sold by the local natives in the streets.\n### Response: ", "target": "Espacio Escult\u00f3rico at Mexico's biggest university campus has a relaxing collection of sculptures .\nStick to the tacos and tequila as if you were anywhere in Mexico .\nZinco bar, on Cinco de Mayo Street downtown, has great jazz music, cheerful crowd .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Read the following passage and summarize it.Washington (CNN) -- Two hours after first being notified of an attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, a government e-mail to the White House, the State Department and the FBI said an Islamist group had claimed credit, according to a copy obtained by CNN. An initial e-mail was sent while the attack was still underway, and another that arrived two hours later -- sent from a State Department address to various government agencies including the executive office of the president -- identified Ansar al-Sharia as claiming responsibility for the attack on its Facebook page and on Twitter. The group denied responsibility the next day. However, the e-mails raise further questions about the seeming confusion on the part of the Obama administration to determine the nature of the September 11 attack that left U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans dead. Two White House officials, speaking on condition of not being identified on Wednesday, said the government e-mails about the attack were not an intelligence assessment. They also noted that there was conflicting information about Ansar al-Sharia denying responsibility. Read what U.S. intel sees is an al Qaeda in Iraq link . \"They were a part of the many different reports we were receiving that day,\" one of the White House officials said of the e-mails. \"There are always multiple and conflicting reports in the initial hours of an attack. That's why you have an investigation.\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton advised reporters to wait until a review panel she appointed to investigate what happened completed its work. \"The Independent Accountability Review Board is already hard at work looking at everything, not cherry picking one story here or one document there but looking at everything, which I highly recommend as the appropriate approach to something as complex an attack like this,\" Clinton said Wednesday. \"You know, posting something on Facebook is not in and of itself evidence. I think it just underscores how fluid the reporting was at the time and continued for some time to be,\" Clinton said. She repeated her earlier pledge to \"take whatever measures are necessary to fix anything that needs to be fixed, and we will bring those to justice who committed these murders.\" Meanwhile, White House spokesman Jay Carney noted the e-mail about the claim of responsiblity \"was an open-source, unclassified e-mail referring to an assertion made on a social media site that everyone in this room had access to and knew about instantaneously.\" Carney added that \"the whole point of an intelligence community and what they do is to assess strands of information and make judgments about what happened and who was responsible.\" The day after the attack took place, President Barack Obama referred to it as an \"act of terror.\" What the administration has said . But in the following days, Carney maintained there was no evidence suggesting the attack was \"planned or imminent.\" In attack aftermath, disagreement over how it began . The administration also suggested that an anti-Muslim video produced in the United States likely fueled a spontaneous demonstration in Benghazi as it had in Cairo, where the U.S. Embassy also was attacked. Clinton, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland and Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, all cited the video as a motivating factor in the attack. On September 13 -- two days after the attack -- a senior U.S. official told CNN that the violence in Libya was not the work of \"an innocent mob.\" \"The video or 9/11 made a handy excuse and could be fortuitous from their perspective, but this was a clearly planned military-type attack,\" the official said. However, it wasn't until September 19 that Matthew Olsen, the nation's counterterrorism chief, told senators that it was a terrorist attack. The next day, Carney also said it was \"self-evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack.\" The e-mails obtained by CNN provide additional insight into the Benghazi attack. The first one, sent at 4:05 p.m. ET, or 10:05 p.m. in Libya, described a diplomatic mission under attack. \"Approximately 20 armed people fired shots; explosions have been heard as well,\" the e-mail said. Stevens and four other mission staff were in the compound safe haven, it added. Less than an hour later, at 4:54 p.m. ET, another e-mail reported \"firing at the U.S. Diplomatic Mission in Benghazi has stopped and the compound has been cleared.\" It said a search was underway for consulate personnel. The final e-mail, at 6:07 p.m., noted the claim of responsibility for the attack. The subject line said: \"Update 2: Ansar al-Sharia Claims Responsibility for Benghazi Attack.\" \"Embassy Tripoli reports the group claimed responsibility on Facebook and Twitter and has called for an attack on Embassy Tripoli,\" the e-mail said. The Facebook claim of involvement was subsequently denied by the group at a news conference in the following days, but not very convincingly. \"We are saluting our people for this zeal in protecting their religion, to grant victory to the prophet,\" a spokesman for Ansar al-Sharia said at the time. \"The response has to be firm.\" It is common for one or more claims of responsibility to follow high-profile attacks on U.S. targets, and intelligence officials analyze them for validity before declaring any legitimate. For example, groups make false claims to seek publicity and raise their profile. Analysts examine a group's history, whether it made previous claims that were legitimate, whether it has the capacity to carry out such an attack, and whether known members of the group participated in the attack in assessing the validity of claims of responsibility.

About 100 protesters were throwing stones and burning tires in the West Bank city of Hebron, the Israeli military said. Palestinian eyewitnesses reported that several protesters had been injured by tear gas and rubber bullets. The clashes come in the wake of a special Sunday Cabinet meeting held at one of the \"national heritage\" sites where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu outlined a plan to invest more than $100 million on national heritage infrastructure. \"People must be familiar with their homeland and its cultural and historical vistas,\" he said. \"This is what we will instill in this and coming generations, to the glory -- if I may say -- of the Jewish people.\" Included in the list of sites are Rachel's Tomb in Palestinian city of Bethlehem and the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the city of Hebron. A top United Nations official said the inclusion of sites in the West Bank raised concerns because they were \"in occupied Palestinian territory.\" The Tomb of the Patriarchs -- known to Palestinians as Ibrahimi mosque -- is in Hebron, a West Bank city that houses about 500 Jews heavily guarded by Israeli soldiers, who live among about 170,000 Palestinians. The tomb is revered by Jews and Muslims as holy and has been a point of frequent conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians for years. In 1994, an Israeli settler entered the tomb and opened fire on the Muslim worshippers, killing 29 before he was beaten to death. Rachel's Tomb is known to Palestinians as the mosque of Bilal. The Palestinian reaction after the announcement was fast and furious. A statement by the Revolutionary Council of Fatah, the political faction in charge of the Palestinian Authority, called the Israeli plan a move to \"consolidate the occupation\" and an effort at \"judaizing\" Palestinian land. Dr. Hamdan Taha, an official at the Palestinian Authority's Ministry of Tourism, said the the two sites were \"an integral part of Palestinian culture\" and that if the Israeli government persisted in its efforts, \"Palestinians will feel free to nominate sites inside the green line in their heritage list.\" Green line refers to the border before Israel occupied the West Bank. Nationalist and right wing parties in Israel praised the government move and called for the inclusion of more West Bank locations to the list of heritage sites. Robert H. Serry, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, also expressed concern. \"These sites are in occupied Palestinian territory and are of historical and religious significance not only to Judaism but also to Islam, and to Christianity as well,\" he said in a statement. \"I urge Israel not to take any steps on the ground which undermine trust or could prejudice negotiations, the resumption of which should be the highest shared priority of all who seek peace.\" Nationalist and right-wing parties in Israel praised the government move and called for the inclusion of more West Bank locations to the list of heritage sites. Mark Regev, a spokesman for Netanyahu, said no one could deny that the two West Bank locations were of historical and religious significance to the Jews. He said the danger of their inclusion on a list of sites to the peace process was overstated.\n### Response :", "target": "Sites include Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem and Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron .\nTomb of the Patriarchs is known to Palestinians as Ibrahimi mosque .\nTomb revered by Jews and Muslims as holy and has been a point of frequent conflict .\nRachel's Tomb is known to Palestinians as the mosque of Bilal .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

A hospital worker has admitted to secretly injecting herself and using unclean syringes for patients. Kristen Diane Parker, who worked at Rose Medical Center in Denver, has admitted to secretly injecting herself in a bathroom and using unclean syringes as replacements for patients, investigators said. She had hepatitis C, which she believes she contracted through using heroin and sharing dirty needles while she lived in New Jersey in 2008, authorities said. She was a surgical technician at Rose from October 2008 to April 2009. Nine patients who had surgery there during that time have tested positive for hepatitis C. Investigators are looking into whether they contracted the virus from Parker. According to an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration, Rose Medical Center knew Parker tested positive for hepatitis C. She was counseled on how to limit her exposure to patients. Parker quit after she was found to be in an operating room where she was not allowed to be. She subsequently tested positive for fentanyl. Hospital officials then contacted the DEA. Parker is in federal custody facing three drug-related charges. If she is found to have done serious harm to a patient, she could face up to 20 years in prison. If a patient dies because of her actions, she could face life in prison. In a statement to police, Parker said, \"I can't take back what I did, but I will have to live with it for the rest of my life, and so does everyone else.\" Her attorney could not be reached Friday. Rose Medical Center is contacting 4,700 patients who had surgery at Rose during the time Parker was employed there. However, hospital officials do not believe that many patients were exposed. \"We are taking a very conservative and cautious approach by contacting everyone who had surgery during this broad time period,\" a statement on the hospital's Web site said, adding, \"It is likely that most of the patients who receive letters will not have been exposed to hepatitis C.\" An additional 1,200 patients may have been infected between May 4, 2009, and July 1, 2009, when Parker worked at Audubon Ambulatory Surgical Center in Colorado Springs. Audubon is also contacting patients. According to the Centers for Disease Control, hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.\n### Response:", "target": "Kristen Diane Parker believes she contracted hepatitis C from sharing dirty needles .\nShe was a surgical technician in Denver from October 2008 to April 2009 .\nHepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The Finn made his return to F1 in 2012 after a two-year absence and propelled his Lotus car towards the front of the grid, grabbing a win at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on his way to finishing third in the drivers' championship. \"Nothing I saw last year made me think that another championship was impossible in the future,\" added Raikkonen. \"Of course, there is some pretty tough competition out there and everyone wants to win. \"The team have beaten everyone before and there's nothing to say they can't do it again.\" Many observers were surprised to see Raikkonen, who spent time racing in NASCAR and the World Rally Championship during his two-year absence, return to F1 and enjoy immediate success despite being a veteran of 19 previous grands prix wins. But Raikkonen never lost doubt in his own ability as a driver. \"I knew I could still perform well in Formula 1 given the right opportunity,\" the Finn continued. \"It was only other people who had doubts. \"There will be a new car which we'll want to develop and get working at its best.

Western tourists oblivious to the severe drugs laws in the UAE often end up in jail after arriving in the conservative Muslim country with tiny amounts of narcotics. DJ Grooverider, whose real name is Raymond Bingham, was jailed Tuesday for four years in Dubai for possession of cannabis, said a spokesman for BBC Radio 1, where the he presented a weekly drum 'n bass show. He was arrested November 23 after being caught with 2.16 grams of the drug at the airport, the BBC spokesman said. \"It's another incident of exactly the sort of case we've seen occurring with increased frequency,\" said Catherine Wolthuizen, chief executive of Fair Trials International. The charity issued a warning to travelers earlier this month, urging them to read up on Dubai's restrictions and make sure they are free of any substances. The warning followed a series of cases in which Dubai authorities arrested travelers with trace amounts of banned substances or seemingly innocuous items. Fair Trials highlighted the case of a Swiss man jailed for having three poppy seeds on his shirt which apparently came from a sandwich he had eaten at the airport before departure. UAE customs officials said the man was stopped after arriving in Dubai from Zurich on January 18, though it provided no other details on his case. The U.S. State Department warns that poppy seeds are on the UAE's list of controlled substances. An official at the UAE's police labs who declined to be named said the Emirates only ban raw poppy seeds -- not baked -- because raw seeds could be planted for drug use. The British and U.S. governments have warnings in place for travelers to the UAE, alerting them to the severe penalties for being found with drugs, and the types of drugs which are illegal in the country. \"The possession and/or import of even the smallest amount of drugs can result in a minimum prison sentence of four years,\" states the advice from Britain's Foreign Office. \"The presence of drugs in the system is counted as possession.\" Some prescribed medications -- such as Valium or those used for hormone replacement therapy -- are forbidden even with a prescription, Fair Trials said. Codeine, which is available over the counter in Britain, is allowed only with a doctor's prescription, the Foreign Office states. Fair Trials mentioned the case of an unnamed 20-year-old who was traveling back to England from Pakistan. The charity said he was arrested after customs officers allegedly found 0.02 grams of cannabis in his pocket. UAE customs officials told CNN the 20-year-old was arrested January 16 and actually was found with 0.67 grams of cannabis. \"Travelers must be aware about and understand the laws of any country they visit,\" said a customs official, who also declined to be named. The BBC spokesman said Grooverider, who went to Dubai to work at a club, claimed he forgot the drugs were in the pocket of a pair of trousers. \"Grooverider is paying a very high price for a serious mistake,\" the Radio 1 spokesman said. Fair Trials' Wolthuizen said one thing is clear: Travelers to the UAE must be careful. \"The Emirates are quite happy to be known as having an unusually strict approach to enforcing their drug laws,\" Wolthuizen said. \"They are going to extraordinary lengths to enforce them.\" E-mail to a friend .\n### Response :", "target": "Grooverider sentence highlights UAE's strict drug rules .\nThe DJ was jailed for four years in Dubai on Tuesday for possession of cannabis .\nHe was arrested November 23 after being caught with 2.16 grams of the drug .\nThe Emirates have an unusually strict approach to enforcing their drug laws .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The plane carrying Bieber and others -- presumably his entourage -- was clearing customs after touching down at Teterboro Airport when U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers said they detected the odor, law enforcement sources said. Drug-sniffing dogs were used to search the plane, according to one of the sources. But no sign of drugs were detected and no illegal substances were found, the source said. Bieber's interview was described by another law enforcement source as one that is carried out for anyone entering the United States, and that it can take 10 minutes or 10 hours. The interview is routinely conducted to ensure people entering the country are in compliance with U.S. law, the source said. Bieber was interviewed for several hours before being cleared to enter the United States. The plane sat on the airport tarmac for at least four hours, and CNN saw law enforcement officers getting off the plane. Customs and Border Protection officials did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. It's the latest headache for the embattled singer, who has made a number of headlines in recent weeks. Bieber's plane was en route from Canada, where on Wednesday he surrendered to Toronto police, who booked him on an assault charge. He was accused of hitting a limousine driver a month ago. That same day, Florida authorities released police documents that accused Bieber of being under the influence of alcohol, pot and Xanax when police stopped him for allegedly street racing in Miami Beach last week. Bieber was booked on charges of driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license. He was briefly jailed, and his attorney has entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. The two arrests come on the heels of allegations that he egged a neighbor's house in Calabasas, California, causing thousands of dollars in damage in the process. When authorities searched the singer's home as part of the investigation into the alleged egg-throwing, a sheriff's deputy found suspected illegal drugs at the bedside of Bieber house guest Lil Za, who now faces a felony drug charge. A prosecutor is expected to decide as early as next week whether Bieber will be charged with felony vandalism in connection with the case. Since being discovered in 2008 performing cover songs in clips posted on YouTube, Bieber shot into the superstar stratosphere with a legion of young fans known as Beliebers. But his onstage persona, once so appealing to parents of his 'tween fans, started taking hits. From being accused of public urination to rumors of a visit to a Brazilian brothel and run-ins with police, including a search of his Calabasas home by authorities in connection with the egging case, his once squeaky clean image has all but disappeared. In its place, a bad-boy image that has a number of critics, including some calling for the Canadian-born Bieber's deportation. The petition, titled \"Deport Justin Bieber and revoke his green card,\" had garnered more than 100,000 signatures. Bieber has a visa allowing him to legally live in the United States because of his \"extraordinary ability\" in the arts. Bieber's musical mentor, Usher Raymond, a former teen star himself, told MTV in December 2013 that his young protege was experiencing the pains of growing up in the spotlight. \"With success comes great responsibility. And being able to grow up in it and unfortunately be analyzed in front of the world for just growing up, I think they will be able to see the truth,\" Usher said. \"And they can make an assessment based off of what his reality looks like.\" On Thursday, Bieber took to Twitter to thank supporters in his hometown of Stratford, Canada, where he took refuge before flying to New Jersery. \"Never forget where you come from or those who supported you before anyone else. still the small town kid. thanks,\" he tweeted. Could Justin Bieber be deported? Susan Candiotti reported from Teterboro, New Jersey; and Chelsea J. Carter wrote from Atlanta.

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the central ideas presented?\n### Input :Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- President Ali Abdullah Saleh plans to return to Yemen following the investigation into his attempted assassination, a government spokesman said. The announcement follows claims weeks ago by the Yemeni government it had completed the investigation, accusing two leading opposition figures of planning the June palace bombing that left Saleh with severe burns and shrapnel wounds. The Yemeni government switched gears Sunday, saying the investigation was nearly complete. Abdu Ganadi, the government spokesman, did not say when it would be finished nor whether those accused earlier were still considered suspects. \"I cannot give you a specific time of when President Saleh will arrive. But I can assure you that after the palace bombing investigation is over, the president will be back,\" Ganadi said. The Yemeni political crisis started January 16, when youth protesters took to the streets demanding Saleh's resignation. Fears of all-out civil war have spiked in recent months as government forces and people alleged to be Hashed tribesmen slugged it out in the capital. Saleh, who has been faced with widespread anti-government sentiment and militant activity, has been urged to accept a political transition plan that will lead to his departure. He has been in Saudi Arabia for treatment of wounds he suffered in a June 3 attack on his palace. Some see the timing of Ganadi's announcement as a tactic by Saleh to delay stepping down from power. Saleh said in March he would leave office by the end of the year. \"If Saleh leaves office before the end of the year, history will report it that he was ousted by the revolution,\" said Ali Abdul Jabbar, an analyst and the director of the Sanaa-based Dar Ashraf Research Center. Opposition members, though, see it as a way for Saleh to avoid returning to Yemen to face possible criminal prosecution. \"The opposition and revolution youth hope that Ali Abdullah Saleh comes back to Yemen so that they can try him for all the crimes he committed against the people over the last 33 years,\" said Hamid al-Ahmar, a leading opposition figure. Ahmar, the opposition's wealthiest businessman, and Ali Mohsen, the most powerful military leader in the country, were accused by the Yemeni government on August 18 of planning the palace attack.\n### Response :", "target": "Official: \"I cannot give you a specific time of when President Saleh will arrive\"\nAn official backtracks on claim that investigation into the attack on Saleh is complete .\nEarlier, the government accused two opposition members of planning the attack .\nPresident Saleh is said to be in Saudi Arabia recovering from burn wounds .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?(CNN) -- Lampooning politicians in Kenya's The Nation newspaper has been cartoonist Godfrey Mwampembwa's job since 1992, but it was his vocation long before that. Better known by his pen name Gado, Mwampembwa started drawing as a teenager and soon found that blending satire with his drawings could lead to a career. Freelance jobs at newspapers and magazines in Tanzania and Kenya followed for Dar es Salaam's Daily News, Business Times and The Express. Since 1992, Gado has worked as an editorial cartoonist and illustrator for the Kenyan-based Daily Nation, the largest newspaper in East and Central Africa. But now the cartoonist has taken his 2D black-and-white satirizing from the page to the screen. Mwampembwa was the brains behind \"The XYZ Show,\" Kenya's first satirical puppet TV show that aired earlier this year. \"The XYZ Show\" is based on the hugely popular \"Spitting Image\" show that aired in the UK from 1984 to 1996, and France's popular \"Les Guignols,\" featuring latex caricature puppets of politicians and celebrities. \"The XYZ Show\" had been in the pipeline since 2002, but Mwampembwa found it a tough sell to broadcasters in areas where more Western-style satire had not been seen before. There was also the issue of keeping editorial control over the project. \"We said, 'We would control the content, because we know where we want to take this. We want it to be independent. We want it to be fair. We want it to be hard-hitting,'\" Mwampembwa told Variety magazine. In the end, financial support from the Ford Foundation arrived to breathe life into the project and its latex puppets. While entertaining, the show is also making people think about and discuss the issues that made Mwampembwa pick up his pen and get \"The XYZ Show\" on air. Kenya's disputed election in December 2007 added even more fuel to his expos\u00e9 of Kenyan politics. \"After the 2007 elections, we argued that it was the right time for a show like this, that Kenya needed a show like this: We have one [coalition] government and no opposition so we needed to strengthen criticism,\" Mwampembwa told the Global Post. Many don't take kindly to the criticism; Mwampembwa has allegedly faced threats to his personal safety during his career. But that \"The XYZ Show\" could be broadcast shows a freedom of media in Kenya that Mwampembwa appreciates. As for keeping a keen eye on the country's politicians, he believes it's not his job alone. \"I think it's everybody's duty,\" he told the BBC. \"You can't put that responsibility on one individual, as every Kenyan should contribute to expose what is happening and to expose corruption.\" Watch Gado on CNN on African Voices on Saturday, November 7, 11.30 and 18.30 GMT Sunday, November 8, 17.00 GMT .\n### Response: ", "target": "Godfrey Mwampembwa, better known as Gado, is Kenya's best-known cartoonist .\nHas been penning his politically charged cartoons in The Nation since 1992 .\nWas the creative force behind Kenya's new satirical puppet show, \"The XYZ Show\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

(Associated Press) \n  \n NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A longtime business partner of President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen, whose business dealings are being scrutinized by federal prosecutors, pleaded guilty on Tuesday in a state tax fraud case that requires him to cooperate in any ongoing investigation, according to a person briefed on the deal. \n  \n Yellow cab magnate Evgeny \"Gene\" Freidman, the so-called Taxi King of New York, pleaded guilty to a single count of tax fraud in an Albany courthouse, almost a year after state prosecutors and tax authorities charged him with pocketing $5 million in mandatory, per-ride transportation fees. \n  \n For years, Freidman has managed hundreds of taxi medallions, the physical plates affixed to cabs that owners are required to display, including more than two dozen owned by Cohen, Trump's longtime fixer. The two men, both lawyers, also have been close personally for decades \u2014 Freidman told the real estate publication the Real Deal last February that Cohen helped him name his eldest son. \n  \n Still, it wasn't immediately clear what if any information Freidman could provide to investigators probing Cohen's financial dealings. His lawyer, Patrick Egan, declined to discuss the deal and said he couldn't comment on what the plea \"indicates regarding any case other than my client's.\" \n  \n Cohen's attorney didn't return phone and email messages seeking comment. \n  \n In announcing the deal, the attorney general's office made no mention of potential cooperation, saying that Freidman would be required to pay back the money he was charged with pocketing, including $500,000 within 30 days of his plea. \n  \n The person familiar with the case wasn't authorized to publicly discuss it and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. \n  \n FBI agents last month raided Cohen's home, office and hotel room as part of a monthslong probe into the Trump fixer's finances, including his dealings in the taxi industry, according to court papers and people familiar with the investigation. \n  \n The case was referred to Manhattan federal prosecutors by Robert Mueller, the special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians. \n  \n Cohen has emerged in recent months at the center of controversies facing Trump, most notably for his role facilitating a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels just days before Election Day. \n  \n Trump denies having an affair with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. But she and her publicity-friendly attorney have pressed their case in courtrooms in Los Angeles and in New York, as well as on Twitter, claiming that Cohen's campaign-era non-disclosure agreement to keep Clifford from discussing the alleged 2006 affair with the then-reality TV star is invalid. \n  \n Agents who took part in the April raid of Cohen's homes and offices obtained records pertaining to that deal among other documents, people familiar with the probe have told the AP. ||||| Later Tuesday, Mr. Freidman texted a New York Times reporter about the article that had been published about his guilty plea, calling it \u201cshameful\u201d and comparing it to a tabloid story. \u201cMichael is dear dear personal friend and a passive client! That\u2019s it!\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am humbled and shamed!\u201d he said, adding that the guilty plea represented \u201cme taking responsibility for my actions.\u201d \n  \n \u201cI had been an officer of the court in excess of 20 years and now I am a felon!\u201d he wrote. \u201cI hate that I have been grouped in this runaway train that I am not a part of!\u201d \n  \n But asked if he was cooperating with the authorities, Mr. Freidman would not respond. \n  \n After Mr. Freidman\u2019s guilty plea, his lawyer, Patrick J. Egan of Fox Rothschild, declined to comment. But earlier this year he said his client \u201cconsiders Michael a very good friend and a great client.\u201d \n  \n Nonetheless, Mr. Freidman\u2019s agreement to cooperate in his tax fraud case in Albany could have larger implications. Mr. Cohen is facing an investigation by the United States attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan, which is examining his business practices. Anything that bolsters that inquiry could increase pressure on Mr. Cohen to cooperate with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who is investigating the 2016 election that led to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory. \n  \n Last month, federal agents carried out search warrants at Mr. Cohen\u2019s home, his office and a hotel room where he was staying. The search sought a wide range of materials, including documents related to his business associates and accountants, as well as a $130,000 payment to Stephanie Clifford, the adult film actress known as Stormy Daniels, who has said she had an affair with Mr. Trump. \n  \n Mr. Cohen is best known as Mr. Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, a role given more prominence by the actor Ben Stiller\u2019s recurring portrayal of him on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d But he has a wide range of business interests of his own that have drawn scrutiny, from taxicabs to real estate to a failed casino boat. \n  \n Mr. Cohen and an earlier partner in the taxi business managed a company that operated 260 yellow cabs in the early 2000s, a massive fleet that brought in millions of dollars in annual revenue \u2014 much of it in cash. Today, he still owns 32 taxi medallions in New York and 22 in Chicago, a portfolio estimated to be worth at least $10 million. |||||\n### Response:", "target": "\u2013 The \"Taxi King of New York\" has made a plea deal that could be bad news for Michael Cohen. Evgeny Freidman, the longtime business partner of President Trump's lawyer, entered a guilty plea in a state tax fraud case Tuesday after making a deal to cooperate with investigators, an insider tells the AP. The deal could be used as leverage to persuade Cohen to cooperate with Robert Mueller's investigation of alleged election meddling, as well as with the federal prosecutors in New York looking into Cohen's businesses, reports the New York Times. But while Cohen and Freidman have long been close friends, it's not clear how much information on the lawyer's financial dealings Freidman would be able to give investigators. Friedman, who managed dozens of New York City taxi medallions\u2014the permits needed to operate yellow cabs\u2014on behalf of Cohen, had been facing up to 25 years on each of five felony charges related to his failure to pay $5 million in state taxi ride surcharges. Under the deal, he pleaded guilty to a single count of evading $50,000 in taxes and will receive five years of probation instead of prison time. He will also be required to pay $5 million in restitution to the state. Sources say that as part of the deal, Freidman specifically agreed to assist state and federal prosecutors, though he says the plea is about taking responsibility for his own actions and has nothing to do with his \"dear personal friend\" Cohen.

{"source": "### Instruction:Could you highlight the primary messages?\n### Input:(EW.com) -- As the title character of Steven Spielberg's solemnly transfixing \"Lincoln,\" Daniel Day-Lewis is tall and elegantly stooped, with thatchy gray-black hair, sunken cheeks, and a grin that tugs at the corners of his mouth whenever he tries to win someone over by telling them a good story (which is often). Day-Lewis looks so much like the photographs of Abraham Lincoln that you don't have to squint, even a bit, to buy that it's him. He nails Lincoln's thousand-yard stare \u2014 a gaze directed at once inward (at the whir of his own mental machinery) and outward (at the cosmic hum of history). Day-Lewis' performance has a beautiful gravitas, yet there's nothing too severe about it. He gives Lincoln a surprisingly plainspoken, reedy high voice that retains the courtly cadences of the South. That voice \u2014 from everything we know, it's quite accurate \u2014 makes Lincoln sound like Will Rogers as a professor of human nature. This Lincoln lives deep inside his own unruly-haired head, yet he loves the people around him, even the ignorant (and racist) common folk, who repay the favor by loving him back. And that's where he draws his political force. Photos: 'Lincoln' extras pose for portraits . \"Lincoln,\" which Spielberg has directed from a lyrical, ingeniously structured screenplay by Tony Kushner, is one of the most authentic biographical dramas I've ever seen. But that doesn't mean it's a stiff-jointed history lesson. The movie is grand and immersive. It plugs us into the final months of Lincoln's presidency with a purity that makes us feel transported as though by time machine. (Kushner is the husband of EW columnist Mark Harris.) Most of the film unfolds in January 1865, shortly after Lincoln's reelection, when he knows that the North is going to win the Civil War. The real battle for him now is the fight against slavery. Three commissioners from the Confederacy head up to Washington City, and Lincoln is confident that he could have their surrender within a week. But before that can happen, he is driven to pass the 13th Amendment, which would outlaw slavery. The Democrats hate the amendment, and even Lincoln's liberal Republican comrades want him to delay the vote. Only Lincoln grasps the stakes: that once the Civil War is over, the amendment won't pass \u2014 it will be blocked by the Southern states. Winning the war could prove a Pyrrhic victory. Only by threading the amendment through the eye of a legislative needle can he alter the course of history. Lincoln features a great deal of incendiary speech-making on the floor of the House of Representatives, and Kushner's script, which is based in part on the Doris Kearns Goodwin book Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, has a lot of fun weaving insults of astonishing brazenness into oratory that lays bare the issues in all their gripping moral complexity. Spielberg, denying himself visual fireworks, frames the action with a kind of stately tension. He thrillingly demythologizes Lincoln by placing us inside Lincoln's experience \u2014 shut up by himself (or with his querulous cabinet) in the drab meeting rooms of the White House, or in his bedroom with the ambitious, haunted Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field), who still blames Abe for the death of their son Willie. Field's performance is shattering \u2014 in a few furious scenes, she redefines this First Lady as a woman whose supposed madness reflected a humane fervor as sterling as her husband's. As the congressional fight rages on, \"Lincoln\" orchestrates it all. He seduces, cajoles, begs, and tyrannizes. He offers patronage jobs \u2014 bribes \u2014 to the Democratic congressmen who support slavery. He courts but also tamps down the influence of Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), the abolitionist who's so possessed by the cause that he might alienate any congressman on the fence. And through it all, Lincoln must delay the war's end \u2014 without breaking the people's faith. The Lincoln we see here is that rare movie creature, a heroic thinker. He has the serpentine intellect of a master lawyer, infused with a poet's passion. \"Lincoln\" brilliantly dramatizes the delicacy of politics, along with the raw brutality of it. All that's pushing the amendment forward is Abe Lincoln's will, his ability to do anything \u2014 even flirt with impeachable deceptions \u2014 to fulfill his vision of justice. And that's why he spends the movie alone in spirit. When he bangs his hand on the table, roaring at his lobbyists to procure him the votes he needs because he's ''clothed in immense power,'' we're seeing the birth of the presidency as we know it \u2014 a force that can shape the consciousness of the world. Lincoln is a stirring paradox, a dream of history as it might truly have happened. See the original article at EW.com.

David asks, \"What's the difference?\" \"Huge difference,\" Sanders responds, a nod to both Donald Trump and Curb Your Enthusiasm. \n  \n Despite bonding through the traumatic situation, when it's discovered that the ship crashed on Liberty Island, David's character quickly turns down an offer to share a cab with Sanderswitzski. ||||| With A Little Help From Larry David, Bernie Sanders Does 'SNL' \n  \n The buzz built all week. And rumors that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and Curb Your Enthusiasm star Larry David would appear on Saturday Night Live \u2014 together \u2014 were finally confirmed just before the weekend. \n  \n But if you started watching SNL looking to #FeelTheBern, you might have had a moment of worry, at least at first. The Vermont senator did not appear in the show's cold open. He did not come on stage during David's monologue. He didn't even appear in a pre-taped sketch all about him, called \"Bern Your Enthusiasm,\" where David, playing Sanders, loses the Iowa caucuses by annoying just enough voters in the way only Larry David (or Bernie Sanders, or Larry David \u2014 we're confused) can. It was smart, and with a cameo by a coughing, no-hand-wiping Leslie Jones, it touched on Sanders' lingering inability to attract widespread support from black voters. \n  \n In a pre-taped sketch, cleverly named \"Bern Your Enthusiasm\" a-la Larry David's show Curb Your Enthusiasm, we learn how Bernie Sanders lost in Iowa by a hair. SNL YouTube \n  \n But Sanders finally did appear, in a skit where he and David play two men on a distressed ship headed to America, arguing over who gets into lifeboats first during a storm. Sanders' character, Bernie Sanderswitzky, rails against Larry David's character when he tries to get preferential treatment because he's rich. \"I'm so sick of the 1 percent getting this preferential treatment,\" Sanders says, alluding to one of his central campaign messages. David says that all sounds like socialism. Sanders corrects David, and replies, \"democratic socialism.\" \n  \n In the bit, Sanders' character also makes light of his Jewish heritage, joking that he'd change his last name, Sanderswitzky, when he gets to America, \"so it doesn't sound so Jewish.\" \n  \n SNL YouTube \n  \n Sanders' campaign played up the senator's appearance on Twitter. Near the start of the show, he tweeted out a fundraising appeal, with a Curb Your Enthusiasm reference: \"We need your vacuum pennies. Chip in a few,\" read the tweet, with a link to donate. \n  \n Overall, there wasn't a lot of Sanders' performance to judge. His cameo was definitely shorter than Donald Trump's a few months ago, and seemed to have even fewer lines than Hillary Clinton as Val back in October. After his appearance in the steamship skit, Sanders did return to the stage as David introduced musical guest The 1975. \"It's pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good,\" Sanders said when David asked how his campaign is going. \n  \n And at the end of the show, when the band plays and all the cast hugs and shakes hands, Sanders appeared again, soaking it all in, smiling.

Set up by Christopher Harris in 2007, the blog has become a full-time job for the 39-year-old American. Harris told CNN that he has a strong interest in the Italian football scene, and with a background working in web design and marketing, that motivated him to set up his own site. \"I created it a couple of years ago -- really with the rise in popularity of Serie A. It has continued to grow, and this year the Beckham story was a large factor in that.\" Harris said the rise of Italian football has helped his U.S. based blog flourish since he created it. Read the Serie A Talk blog . Rebounding from the lows of the match-fixing scandal in 2006 -- a World Cup win for the Azzurri and the arrival of top players like Kaka and Ronaldinho has seen Italy's Serie A competition once again become a force in world football. Even today there's no shortage of issues to talk about. With Inter Milan currently storming to the Serie A title, the ongoing David Beckham road-show, and the failure of the Italian clubs in the Champions League -- there's been plenty to discuss and debate on the SerieAtalk blog. Harris said there is plenty of television access to Italian football matches in the U.S. and therefore there was already a base of interest on that side of the Atlantic before he began the blog. The major goal of the blog is to present a unique perspective on some of the issues affecting the Italian game, he said. \"It's a collaboration between several writers around the world. From time to time I write ... but mainly I manage the site. \"Some of our work is talking about the media coverage of the league and looking at the big issues in a unique way,\" Harris said.

The conservatorship is in effect until June 20, when a hearing is scheduled on whether to make the conservatorship permanent, according to the Los Angeles County Superior Court spokeswoman Patricia Kelly. \"Justice was finally served! I just won temporary conservatorship over my father's healthcare. We have been vindicated by the court. Thank you for your prayers, well wishes and support through this entire ordeal,\" Kasem's daughter, Kerri Kasem, posted on her Facebook page soon after the order. Later, she added: \"I believe my father's wife fled the country (or possibly went to an Indian Reservation) with my Dad because she knew I would win in court today. The judge ordered, Adult Protective Services, the PVP Attorney and the police to look for him. Please pray that he is safe.\" Judge Daniel Murphy also ordered that Casey Kasem's whereabouts be disclosed, the daughter's lawyer said. He had \"grave concern\" for the \"safety, health and well-being\" of Casey Kasem, attorney Troy Martin told CNN. A different judge denied a request by Kasem's children that a temporary conservator be appointed for their father last year. Kasem's daughter Julie Kasem and her husband filed that earlier conservatorship petition, claiming the retired radio host \"has been isolated from his daughters, friends and other family\" by his wife. The judge ruled last year that Kasem was being well cared for by his wife, Jean Kasem. Attempts Monday to contact Jean Kasem's attorney, Craig Marcus, were unsuccessful. The petition last year claimed that daughter Julie Kasem and her husband, Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, had been unable to check on Kasem's health even though her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions. They \"have been prevented from exercising their duties\" by Jean Kasem, who has been married to the retired radio host for three decades, the filing argued. \"There is no communication between Jean and us and his daughters,\" said brother Mouner Kasem. \"We have no knowledge of how he is, what he's doing, if he's better, if he's worse, and we're scared that we'll never see him again.\" Last year, Kerri Kasem said that her stepmother suddenly barred her sister, her uncle and some of Kasem's friends from seeing him.

{"source": "### Instruction: In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given review.(CNN) -- A well-publicized estimate that Typhoon Haiyan killed 10,000 people in the Philippines is \"too much,\" and the death toll likely is closer to 2,000 or 2,500, President Benigno Aquino III told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday. \"We're hoping to be able to contact something like 29 municipalities left wherein we still have to establish their numbers, especially for the missing, but so far 2,000, about 2,500, is the number we are working on as far as deaths are concerned,\" he said. The monster storm left behind a catastrophic scene after it made landfall on six Philippine islands last Friday, leaving many without access to food and medical care. At least 800,000 people have been displaced, the United Nations said Tuesday. By Tuesday, Philippines officials said 1,774 bodies had been counted and 2,487 people were injured. The previous estimate of 10,000 killed, Aquino said, came from local officials who perhaps were \"too close\" to the center of destruction to make an accurate guess. The typhoon simply overwhelmed the ability of two or three local governments to do their jobs, which include taking care of the initial response, the President said. For example, in Tacloban, only 20 of 290 police were available when disaster struck; many were tending to their own families, he said. The national government \"had to replace a lot of the personnel with personnel from other regions to take care of government's vital functions,\" Aquino said. The typhoon wreaked havoc on power lines and communications facilities, which meant government officials faced immense difficulties in identifying needs and dispatching relief supplies and equipment. But the situation has improved, he said. All of the national roads are reopened and most of the airports are nearly back to normal operating levels, he said. Still, he added, the sheer number of people affected is daunting. Aquino said the toll might have been higher had it not been for preemptive evacuations, the prepositioning of supplies and cooperation from businesses. \"But, of course, nobody imagined the magnitude that this super typhoon brought on us,\" he said. Aquino expressed gratitude for the aid that has been pouring in from around the world. \"There are, at last count, over 22 countries have either pledged to us, actually given us aid,\" he said.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?\n### Input:Amazon wants you to buy its first smartphone, the Fire, which it unveiled Wednesday. But it also wants you to use that phone to buy more stuff ... from Amazon. And one of the device's most distinctive features is designed to make it as easy as possible do just that. It's called Firefly, and it contains image-, text- and audio-recognition technology to help you scan and identify books, songs, movies and other items. Amazon wants you to use Firefly so much that the feature has its own dedicated button on the side of the phone for one-stop shopping. \"The Firefly button lets you identify printed Web and email addresses, phone numbers, QR and bar codes, artwork, and over 100 million items, including songs, movies, TV shows, and products -- and take action in seconds,\" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in announcing the phone, which will run Amazon's Fire operating system. For example, you could use the phone's cameras and sensors to identify an exotic fruit or vegetable, figure out who sings a song on the radio or help send an e-mail to a new contact after scanning their business card. But forget all that. Well, except for maybe the song. Once you've identified the tune, Amazon wants you to download it. From Amazon. Bezos demonstrated the feature onstage Wednesday by using the phone to instantly identify items arrayed on a table, including a book, a CD and a jar of Nutella. As with products like its Kindle e-readers, Kindle Fire tablets and Amazon Fire TV, the Fire Phone is designed to pull you into Amazon's growing universe of products and services and then keep you there. So with Firefly, the Amazon Music Store will pop up as the default source to buy that song. And that's also where those QR and bar codes come in. Firefly will make it even easier to pursue a habit that has proliferated in the smartphone age and driven brick-and-mortar stores crazy. A user will presumably be able to walk into a store, pick out a product they like, zap it with Firefly and, within a second or two, find out whether it's available on Amazon for less money. (And then maybe even order it right there from their phone.) According to Amazon, the Firefly feature will recognize 70 million products, 35 million songs, 245,000 movies and TV episodes, and 160 live TV channels. That's a lot of chances to spend money. The Fire also boasts a 3-D screen. It ships July 25, although you can pre-order it now. The phone is available only on AT&T's network. If there's one difference between the Firefly-loaded Fire Phone and other Amazon hardware, it's the price. At $199 for a 32GB model and $299 for the 64GB -- with an AT&T contract -- its cost is comparable with that of other high-end smartphones. By comparison, the Kindle Fire tablet debuted in 2011 at $199, a full $300 less than the cheapest iPad 2 at the time. The first Kindle e-reader debuted about $400 but quickly dropped in price. There are Kindles that can now be purchased for about $70. Under Bezos, the company's strategy has been to sell hardware for less than its competitors, sometimes even at a loss, to get customers using other Amazon products. As such, customers who buy the Fire soon will get a free year's subscription (normally $99) to Amazon Prime, which offers two-day shipping, free streaming on Prime Instant Video and access to the Kindle book-lending library. Whether the Fire Phone will be an instant hit remains to be seen. Shoppers may be hesitant to buy a phone online if they can't test it out in stores. But if Amazon can carve out a decent piece of the smartphone market, which moved more than 1 billion phones last year, Firefly may help make sure those Amazon purchases just keep on coming.\n### Response: ", "target": "Firefly is Amazon's recognition tool for the new Fire Phone .\nAmazon says Firefly can identify more than 100 million items .\nUsers can then click to buy an item from Amazon .\nPhone is designed to pull you into Amazon's growing universe of services .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

At least two other diplomatic missions have advised their citizens to leave Benghazi immediately.\" The deadly siege by jihadis at the remote Algerian gas plant has generated fears that a similar attack could happen in Libya. The militants reportedly attacked the Algerian facility because Algeria permitted France to use its air space to attack militants in Mali. Opinion: Algeria hostage crisis shows jihadists on rise . Libyan commanders have called in pro-government militias, or \"revolutionaries\" from the city of Zintan to help protect oil fields. \"As a result of the circumstances Algeria and Niger are going through and the fallout from the Mali crisis, we should be completely ready for any urgent situation that could happen in the area,\" said Col.

{"source": "### Instruction: Write a summary that explains everything about this article for meCan you provide a brief rundown of the text?\n### Input:For close encounters of the furry, feathered, or scaly kind, there's no place on the planet quite like the Galapagos Islands. \"You just see some of the craziest things,\" said Jonathan Brunger, operations manager for Adventure Life, a Montana company that arranges trips to the region. \"While you're out snorkeling, the sea lions will come out and swim with you. ... You feel a little nibble on the end of your flipper, you turn around and there's this sea lion wanting to play with you, wanting you to chase it. \"Other times, they'll come up to your face and they're looking at their own reflection in your snorkel mask.\" The Galapagos -- 19 islands that lie 600 miles west of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean -- are home to species of animals found nowhere else on Earth. Famously visited by Charles Darwin in 1835, the archipelago played a key role in his theory of evolution. These days, both tourists and researchers flock to the islands to see giant tortoises that can live 150 years, marine iguanas that dive to find dinner, flightless cormorants, and penguins that somehow thrive near the equator. With few predators to make them wary of humans, many of the creatures seem tame and curious. \"It's just a fantastically wonderful place,\" said Herb Wilson, a biology professor at Colby College in Waterville, Maine, who has been to the Galapagos twice. \"One of the most exciting things about it is that just the animals there are so fearless. So you have to step over sea lions and marine iguanas just to get from one place to another.\" With their remote location, the Galapagos used to be more of a legend than a destination for most people -- but that's no longer the case. In the 1960s, just 2,000 tourists a year visited the islands, according to The Charles Darwin Foundation. Today, that number has grown to more than 150,000. To limit their impact on the fragile ecosystem, Galapagos National Park -- which makes up 97% of the archipelago -- requires tourists to be accompanied by a certified guide when they enter protected areas. There are also limits on how many people can be at any visitor site at one time. \"They seem to be doing a reasonable job of trying to find the happy medium between access and protection,\" Wilson said. Here are some tips to consider if you want to pursue your own Galapagos adventure. What's the best time to go? You can have a great experience in the Galapagos year-round, Brunger said, so there's really isn't a \"best time\" to go. The busiest tourist seasons are during the summer and around Christmas, when kids are out of school and people have extra vacation, he said. The warmest months are between January and May, when average temperatures reach the upper 70s and the low 80s. The driest months are from June to December. How do you get there? The first step is to fly into mainland Ecuador and land either in Quito or Guayaquil. A nonstop flight from Miami to Quito takes about four hours. From there, travelers can fly to one of two airports in the Galapagos Islands -- Baltra or San Cristobal -- via Lan Ecuador, AeroGal or TAME Airlines. That leg of the journey lasts about three hours from Quito. Wilson said he didn't find the trip particularly difficult. Where do you stay? You can choose land-based lodgings or a cabin at sea. There are four islands in the Galapagos with accommodations for tourists -- options that include everything from small lodges to luxury hotels, Brunger said. Wilson's hotels ranged from rustic to modern, but they were all comfortable and clean, he recalled. He dined at local restaurants, where seafood and chicken dishes were the most common fare. For those who prefer staying on land, Brunger recommended the Finch Bay Eco Hotel in Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz Island and the Iguana Crossing Hotel in Puerto Villamil on Isabela Island. Many visitors, however, choose to take a cruise around the Galapagos, so they stay on board ships and take lots of land excursions. The cruises carry anywhere from 16 to 100 passengers, and most of the ships are relatively small, so this is not a good option if you get seasick easily or are not keen on living on a boat for several days, Brunger said. Beginning next year, new regulations from Galapagos National Park will ban cruises from visiting any site more than once in a 15-day period. The goal is to cut tourist traffic at some of the most popular spots, according to the International Galapagos Tour Operators Association. You can book a 15-day cruise or, if that is too long, sign up for a shorter itinerary. The most popular option is the 8 day/7 night cruise, which \"gives a good overview of the islands,\" Brunger said. What are some of the most popular activities on the Galapagos? Watching all of the incredible creatures, of course. (You might even catch a glimpse of the courtship dance of the blue-footed booby.) But there's also snorkeling, sea kayaking, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and more. \"The Galapagos is a great, great destination for scuba diving,\" Brunger said. \"But it is for intermediate to expert (divers). It's not a place for beginning scuba diving because you have pretty strong underwater currents and the water is quite cold.\" How much does a Galapagos trip cost? As always, it all depends on your accommodations and length of stay, but here's an estimate of expenses: . Coach airfare from the United States to mainland Ecuador varies widely depending on your departure point. Once in Ecuador, a round-trip flight to the Galapagos costs about $400. There is a $100 fee to enter Galapagos National Park. An eight-day cruise around the islands will set you back anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 per person, which includes accommodations, meals and excursions with a naturalist guide, Brunger said.\n### Response :", "target": "The Galapagos Islands are home to species of animals found nowhere else on Earth .\nWith few predators to make them wary, the creatures seem tame and curious .\nGalapagos tourism has been booming despite the archipelago's remote location .\nLodgings are available on four of the islands; many visitors also stay on cruise ships .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?(CNN) -- That was a pretty catchy, sing-songy version of Sir Mix-A-Lot's rap hit \"Baby Got Back\" in Thursday night's episode of \"Glee.\" It was also very familiar to fans of indie singer-songwriter Jonathan Coulton. As angry Coulton fans are clamoring on Twitter, Coulton arranged and recorded an eerily similar \"Baby Got Back\" cover. So similar, in fact, that the \"Glee\" version included Coulton's line \"Johnny C's in trouble,\" replacing the lyric \"Mix-A-Lot's in trouble\" in the original song. Coulton said he was not informed beforehand, nor was he given any credit or compensation for having arranged the melody of the cover song. What's more, he says, Fox Broadcasting representatives told Coulton's representatives that \"they're within their legal rights to do this, and that I should be happy for the exposure,\" he wrote on his blog, \"even though they do not credit me, and have not even publicly acknowledged that it's my version -- so you know, it's kind of SECRET exposure.\" A representative from 20th Century Fox Television told CNN Friday the network is not commenting on the matter. Coulton, known for nerdy and humorous songs such as \"Code Monkey,\" said Friday that he is \"mystified\" about why the show went about using the cover song in this way. \"Glee has a reputation for being a show that celebrates the underdog,\" he said, before catching a plane to San Francisco. \"It's the anti-bullying show. But this is a bullying way to approach this.\" When it comes to copyright protection, however, there's a distinction between what might seem ethical and what is legal, lawyers say. The rights to \"Baby Got Back\" belong with songwriter Anthony L. Ray, also known as Sir Mix-A-Lot, and his music publisher, Universal, who have apparently given proper licenses to Fox and \"Glee,\" said Kevin Parks, a copyright attorney with the Leydig law firm in Chicago who does not represent any party involved in what Twitter users are calling #JoCoGleeGate. Because Coulton's cover is derivative of the original work by Sir Mix-A-Lot, Coulton does not have a copyright claim against \"Glee\" for using the Coulton version, Parks said. Covers don't get their own copyright protection as far as the underlying musical composition, Parks said. But Coulton might have legal footing if the show used Coulton's audio track. \"If 'Glee' used parts of Coulton's actual recording, there would be a copyright claim for him to pursue,\" Parks said. \"If not, Coulton's gripe may have moral weight, but not the force of law.\" Fans of Coulton are not taking this lightly. Some are undertaking sophisticated audio analyses of both song versions, Coulton said. One called \"alacrion\" created a side-by-side comparison of the two songs on SoundCloud, demonstrating a remarkable resemblance. A fan named Paul Potts posted his own investigation into the similarities of the audio, which he called \"pretty convincing.\" \"Hilariously, for me, it comes down to the sound of a duck quacking, which is a sound effect that was in my version, used as a bleep noise to cover up an expletive,\" Coulton said. \"While it is very hard to hear, if I at home mess with the equalizer settings and some filters, I can actually hear that quack is in that mix.\" From this, Coulton believes at least some of his audio was used by the show, although he is unsure how much. Potts explored this quack issue as well, but wrote on his blog that he identified the \"ghost of the quack.\" There have been infringement cases involving rap songs that sampled even four to eight seconds of other songs, and that was deemed illegal, said Mark Lemley, director of the Stanford University program in law, science & technology who is also not representing anyone in this controversy. It may seem like an artist should get paid if his song, whether a cover or something else, is imitated elsewhere, but this is \"one of those holes in the law that just doesn't end up giving the owner of the sound recording copyright much in the way of rights,\" Lemley said. Coulton said his lawyer is in touch with \"the people at 'Glee.'\" Geek celebrities such as the band They Might Be Giants and podcaster Chris Hardwick came out in support of Coulton on Twitter.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?\n### Input:(CNN) -- David Lance Arneson, who helped trigger the global phenomenon of role-playing games as co-inventor of \"Dungeons & Dragons,\" has died at the age of 61. A statement on the game's official Web site, wizards.com, said Arneson died Tuesday evening \"after waging one final battle against cancer.\" Arneson \"developed many of the fundamental ideas of role playing: that each player controls just one hero, that heroes gain power through adventures, and that personality is as important as combat prowess,\" the statement said. The game's co-creator, Gary Gygax, died last year. In 1974, Arneson and Gygax created \"Dungeons & Dragons,\" which allowed players to assume roles in a magical world. They could be fighters or wizards, elves or dwarfs. \"As characters journey through various lands, they search for hidden treasures while battling menacing monsters with their own brains and brawn,\" a description on wizards.com says. Some games would last days or weeks -- or even longer. \"Game campaigns are as limitless as the player's imaginations,\" wizards.com says. What began as a hand-assembled print run of 1,000 games quickly sold out. Young people all over the world started buying up the game. By 1982, sales broke the $20 million mark. Arneson filed a series of lawsuits against Gygax insisting he was not being given credit or proper royalties for his work creating the game. The suits were settled. \"Dungeons and Dragons\" spawned video games, novels, a cartoon, and a movie. The franchise saw a surge this decade after \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"Harry Potter\" movies took off.\n### Response : ", "target": "David Lance Arneson has died at the age of 61 .\nHe helped trigger phenomenon of role-playing games .\nStatement: Arneson died \"after waging one final battle against cancer\"\n\"Dungeons and Dragons\" spawned video games, novels, a cartoon, and a movie .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Paul McCartney (above) and Ringo Starr are teaming up for a fund-raising concert. The star-studded list of performers who will join them include two musicians who were with the Beatles when they journeyed to India's Himalayan foothills in 1968 to learn transcendental meditation from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. \"In moments of madness, it has helped me find moments of serenity,\" McCartney said in the concert announcement. Profits from the April 4 show at New York's Radio City Music Hall will fund the David Lynch Foundation's program, which has already taught 60,000 children around the world how to meditate, foundation spokesman Steve Yellin said. The goal of the project -- which is called \"Change Begins Within\" -- is to teach the meditation technique to a million at-risk children so they have \"life-long tools to overcome stress and violence and promote peace and success in their lives,\" Yellin said. Schools across the United States have asked the group to bring the classes to their students, he said. \"I would like to think that it would help provide them a quiet haven in a not-so-quiet world,\" McCartney said. Singer-songwriter Donovan and musician Paul Horn, who studied at the Maharishi's ashram with the four Beatles, will also perform in the show. \"How great to be playing with Paul, Ringo, and Paul Horn again -- as we did in India in 1968,\" Donovan said. \"It's a real reunion after 40 years of Donovan, Paul Horn, Ringo and Paul McCartney,\" Yellin said. \"It's quite an interesting thing that they are still talking about transcendental meditation.\" Ringo left the ashram after just 10 days -- explaining the food was too spicy for his taste -- and McCartney stayed for six weeks, according to journalist Lewis Lapham in his book \"With the Beatles.\" McCartney and John Lennon wrote many of the songs for the Beatles' White Album while there, but the group disbanded within two years.

{"source": "### Instruction:Could you highlight the primary messages?(CNN) -- For all the heavy baggage that she carries, Hillary Clinton is walking on water. Ham-fisted attempts by the Republicans to smear her brain have backfired horribly (rightly so; they were distasteful), while Republican efforts to hang Benghazi around her neck (Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tried this weekend) have barely dented her popularity among Democrats. Obama calls her a \"buddy\" who would make a \"very effective\" president, and the former secretary of state remains clear front-runner for her party's 2016 presidential nomination. In fact, right now, she's the only real runner. And that can't be healthy -- for democracy, for the Democrats or even for Clinton. How can we be sure she's running? Well, the United States might be the only country in the world where a politician signals his or her ambitions by writing a book. This does not, alas, mean that America's politicians are unusually literate. Often, the book is bad; usually, it's ghostwritten; only occasionally is it worth reading. But it's generally a sign. The title of Hillary Clinton's \"Hard Choices\" -- out on June 9 and helpfully promoted by a series of interviews with TV's biggest anchors -- suggests a woman who is trying to make sense of a troubled recent past. Becoming Obama's secretary of state, Egypt, Libya and the Benghazi fiasco were all arguably \"choices\" forced upon her. That they were \"hard\" implies an admission that the outcome was far from desirable. Clinton is a potential presidential candidate who has to deal with not just one compromised record but two. First, the Bill Clinton administration; second, the Obama administration. In both cases, she seems keen to remind us, she wasn't technically in charge. Such is the strange ambiguity of Hillary Rodham Clinton. First, she was the co-president and architect of Bill's most ambitious domestic reforms, the anti-Tammy Wynette. Then, she was the betrayed wife who did stand by her man. Next the liberal senator, the presidential candidate of the overwhelming majority of the establishment, suddenly a primaries loser who had to reinvent herself as Annie Oakley, finally a loyal servant of the President, a man whose abilities she questioned so rudely in the nomination battle. Like Richard Nixon before her, she is one of those politicians who is defined by longevity. Her politics have changed so often that it's hard to precisely define what Clintonism is anymore, but she has lasted so long in the spotlight that it's become almost impossible to conceive that someday she won't be president. That 2016 is Clinton's time is reflected in the surprising, even depressing, lack of an alternative. What is Vice President Joe Biden doing with his weekends? Or Newark Mayor Cory Booker (who has ruled himself out, if you can believe that)? Or New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo? Without them, who are we left with? Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, headed for Iowa but probably not very well known there? Sen. Elizabeth Warren, sometimes pushed as the working-class Hillary but who would probably be unelectable outside of Massachusetts? Warren, interestingly, has written a book, too. Contrast this silence with the Republican side. The GOP is weighing up Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (whether they've showed any interest in running or not), and this pre-contest contest gives the impression that all the action is on the right while the Democrats just sit out what remains of Obama's second term, waiting for the whole thing to come to a dignified end. Stabenow: Why I'm ready for Hillary . And the Republican struggle is attractively philosophical. Paul represents the rise of libertarianism; Christie channels the spirit of Mayor Richard Daley; Bush is our generation's Nelson Rockefeller; Santorum is running to build heaven on Earth. These people are discussing ideas that will shape the future of the country. Clinton is talking largely about herself. Of course, two years is almost an eternity in politics, and things might change. At pretty much this point in the 2008 contest, Clinton also commanded a lead over her opponents and looked set to win the nomination -- and we all know what happened come Iowa. She is a different kind of politician now, having built statesman status with her time as secretary of state. But headed into her second go at the nomination after over 20 years of dominating the national stage, it's possible that many voters will simply decide that they want a change. Is America really so locked in its partisan, elitist politics that would tolerate another Clinton vs. Bush campaign? Those who think continuity is unhealthy in a democracy might judge not.\n### Response:", "target": "Tim Stanley: Hillary Clinton bashed by GOP, praised by Obama and still front-runner .\nHe says she has new book, top anchors interviewing her; this usually signals candidacy .\nShe must deal with two compromised records, with two administrations, he says .\nStanley: GOP weighing many candidates.

Faintly at first, they emerged: one, two, three and four -- not yet a six-pack. \"In the first three months, I saw such a fast improvement, now I'm worried about plateauing,\" said Jason Dinant. \"My bottom two abs haven't come in yet,\" he said. Since January, Dinant, an iReporter, has tried to get  six-pack abs in time for his 10-year high school reunion in June. Dinant, a Las Vegas, Nevada, resident, is one of the three iReport contributors being followed by CNNhealth as they strive to meet diet and fitness goals they set at the beginning of the year. iReport.com: See the journey to change . Dinant wanted to whip his beanpole figure into muscular shape. He also wanted to display a healthier physique for his blog called \"Naked Boy News,\" where he stands shirtless to give what he calls \"the naked truth about today's news.\" And now the 27-year-old has another motivation. Dinant will be a guest, riding in a chariot-style car for an \"ab-veil\" on June 28 for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride March in New York.  His car is to be accompanied by rows of shirtless men who also have six-packs. Dinant was invited because,  the Naked Boy News is \"a very popular act,\" said Maurice Michaane, director of the event. \"People in the Northeast know him.\" With the parade only two months away, Dinant said: \"Now I'm in high drive. There's no cheating on the diet.\" To get in shape, he works out four to five days a week, performing a combination of core exercises, dumbbell curls and pull-ups. He jogs, does cardio exercises and works with a fitness trainer.  To avoid looking like \"a toothpick with abs,\" he started lifting weights. With a stringent diet and hours at the gym, the 6-foot-tall Dinant shrank from 160 to 143 pounds. Losing weight is normal with all the exercising and dieting, said Robert Dothard, a personal trainer based in Atlanta, Georgia. \"You can't see a six-pack through fat,\" Dinant said. \"Belly fat is the enemy. People reveal their ab muscles, but the nutrition and exercise are also formula for weight loss.\" The key is to eat in increments, but it's difficult for people with traditional, 9-to-5 jobs to eat something every two hours to maintain their weight, he said. Body builders try to offset the weight loss by consuming protein powders and supplements, Dothard said. Dinant's weight loss was completely unintentional. He said eating 16 egg whites and 1\u00bc pounds of chicken breasts every day gets old after three straight months. \"It's hard to eat that much protein,\" Dinant said.  \"I started drinking this protein shake so I can get in all the calories and protein.\" Compared with just four months ago, the \"man boobies\" and the extra layer of flab around his midsection have been lost, Dinant said. And there's an even bigger benefit. \"I'm awake more. I'm alert more and I have more energy,\" he said.  \"I just feel better. My whole body has become healthier and better.\" While pleased with the results, Dinant worried that with two-thirds of a six-pack, his body will begin to plateau. \"Plateaus are really a mental thing,\" Dothard said.  \"When that happens, people start going back to their own habits. So they end up cheating and binging.\" If the body doesn't respond to the workout anymore, more difficult exercises should be adopted. \"Jason has to do something different or harder to maintain results to keep on the track that he's on,\" Dothard said. \"It can be frustrating, especially when he is still working out and the body is not responding to the same thing. People work out 30-45 days and get tremendous results, then it slows down or stops. Nothing's wrong. The body is adjusting to what you're doing.\"\n### Response :", "target": "Jason Dinant, an iReporter, has met two-thirds of his goal for six-pack abs .\nDinant getting in shape for high school reunion and gay pride parade .\nFitness trainer advises using more difficult exercises if body plateaus .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.(CNN) -- The 45 U.N. peacekeepers seized in the Golan Heights have been freed and are in good condition, the United Nations said Thursday. The peacekeepers -- all from Fiji -- were captured two weeks ago by the al-Nusra Front, an al Qaeda affiliate, in the buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-occupied territory. The personnel were handed over to the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force. A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said discussions had been ongoing with captors by \"various parties\" at \"various levels\" to obtain the peacekeepers' release. The U.N. Disengagement Observer Force has overseen a buffer zone in the Golan Heights since 1974 to maintain a ceasefire between Israel and Syria. Fighting from Syria's civil war spilled over into the buffer zone last week. Al-Nusra Front used civilian cars to take the peacekeepers to a U.N. base on the Syrian side of the border, a CNN source said, and the troops walked about 200 meters to the Israeli-occupied Golan side. U.N. vehicles then took the troops to the U.N. observer force command center, the source said. Ban's spokesman said the secretary-general \"appreciates the efforts of all concerned to secure their safe release.\" \"The Secretary-General emphasizes to all parties the impartiality of United Nations peacekeepers,\" the spokesman said. \"The Secretary-General demands that all parties respect UNDOF's mandate, freedom of movement and the safety and security of its personnel.\" Fiji's prime minister described the peacekeepers as heroes in a statement Friday. \"They kept their cool and showed restraint under the most extreme circumstances imaginable. Because of their discipline, not one militant was killed and none of our soldiers were harmed,\" Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama said in a statement. The peacekeepers will be debriefed, he said, and \"obviously deserve a period of rest before they return to their duties.\" Bainimarama also praised the courage of the peacekeepers' families. \"They were naturally distressed and anxious during this difficult time, but they never once questioned why their loved ones were sent to the Golan Heights in the first place,\" he said. \"They know better than anyone else that our mission is to bring peace and security to people living in troubled areas around the world.\" CNN's Kareem Khadder and Chieu Luu contributed to this report.\n### Response: ", "target": "NEW: Fiji's prime minister calls the peacekeepers heroes .\nThe United Nations says they are in good condition .\nThey had been captured by an al Qaeda affiliate .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction: Write a summary that explains everything about this article for meCan you provide a brief rundown of the text?\n### Input:France's interior minister said Monday that based on intelligence analysis, \"a strong presumption exists\" that a French citizen named Maxime Hauchard participated in the \"despicable crimes\" shown on the latest video from ISIS. The video released over the weekend depicts the slayings of several men described by ISIS as Syrian soldiers and appears to show the aftermath of the beheading of U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig. While Hauchard's involvement is only alleged and investigations continue, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said intelligence analysis of the video suggests \"a very high probability that a French citizen has directly participated in the execution of these despicable crimes.\" Public Prosecutor Francois Molins said authorities are investigating the possibility that a second French citizen may have been involved in the killings shown on the video. Hauchard, 22, went to Syria in 2013 after visiting Mauritania the previous year, Cazeneuve said. According to Molins, Hauchard is a \"self-radicalized\" jihadist who traveled to Syria under the guise of a humanitarian mission. He was known to French security services as far back as 2011, the prosecutor said. In July, Hauchard spoke to French broadcaster BFM, describing life as a fighter. \"Everything is paid for. Clothes are paid for. Weapons are not ours, we don't pay for them. Same for the missions, the guns,\" he said, according to a CNN translation of his remarks. \"The other day I wanted to buy shampoo. I wrote it down on the list -- we have a list where we write down stuff. Then the boss goes out shopping at the market. And he brings us back the shampoo, for example, without making us pay.\" \"The goal as a group, the goal as a community is to establish the laws of Allah on Earth,\" he said. \"But from a personal point of view, it is martyrdom.\" The video in which Hauchard is said to have appeared is widely considered the most brutal yet released by the terror group, which is also known by the acroynm ISIL as well as its self-given name, the Islamic State. U.S. President Barack Obama, in confirming Kassig's beheading, called the executions \"pure evil by a terrorist group that the world rightly associates with inhumanity.\" More barbaric ISIS videos expected after Kassig's death, analyst says . The 16-minute production includes a lengthy segment on the group's history and shows in graphic detail beheadings of several men described as Syrian military pilots. Several men without masks, presumably ISIS fighters, are shown in that segment killing the men. The video doesn't show Kassig's death but does show a masked man dressed in black, speaking in what sounds like a English accent. A similar figure appeared in earlier videos depicting the apparent beheadings of Westerners. Kassig is the fifth Western hostage to be killed by ISIS since the United States and its allies began airstrikes against ISIS in August. ISIS is believed to be holding at least two more Western hostages: a 26-year-old female, American aid worker, and John Cantlie, a British journalist, who has appeared in a number of ISIS-produced videos. U.S. officials have credited the air campaign with stopping a wildly successful ISIS ground offensive and disrupting the group's ability to finance and plan its exploits. On Monday, the U.S. military said coalition warplanes conducted 31 airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq between Friday and Monday, hitting fighting positions, staging areas and units in the field, among other targets.

{"source": "### Instruction :Could you highlight the primary messages?\n### Input:(CNN) -- Sarah Shourd, one of three American hikers held in Iran for more than a year, will be released Saturday, Iranian officials said Thursday. An official at Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance said earlier Thursday that one of the three would be freed this weekend, after the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, without specifying which one. But Bak Sahraei, a representative for the Iranian mission to the United Nations, told CNN that Shourd was designated for release \"very soon.\" The Culture Ministry official said one of Iran's vice presidents will be present when the hiker is released at 9 a.m. Saturday. Shourd, along with Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, were detained July 31, 2009, after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while hiking in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Tehran has said the three hikers were spies, and Iran's intelligence minister has hinted the country may consider releasing them in exchange for the release of Iranian prisoners, according to state news outlets. Masoud Shafii, the Iranian lawyer who represents the hikers, said he has put in a formal request for the trio's release within the past two weeks. Shafii said he told prosecutors that a year had passed since their arrests and the government had not shown any just cause for their imprisonment, and that Shourd has a medical condition that requires proper care. After the news first broke Thursday, the mothers of all three said they had seen the reports and were \"urgently seeking further information.\" \"We hope and pray that the reports are true and that this signals the end of all three of our children's long and difficult detention,\" Cindy Hickey, Nora Shourd and Laura Fattal said in a joint statement. \"Shane, Sarah and Josh are all innocent and we continue to call for their immediate release, so that they can return home together and be reunited with our families.\" Upon release, Shourd would be leaving her fiance behind in prison. The families  announced in spring that Shourd and Bauer got engaged in prison and plan to be married when they're both released. In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters, \"We don't know, frankly, what Iran is contemplating at this point.\" He said the United States was making inquiries through the Swiss government, which represents U.S. interests in Tehran. \"Obviously, if this turns out to be true, this is terrific news,\" Toner said. \"The hikers' release is long overdue, and I would just stress that we hope that it's all three hikers.\" CNN's Shirzad Borzorgmehr, Joe Vaccarello, Reza Sayah and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.\n### Response : ", "target": "NEW: Jailed hiker Sarah Shourd to be freed \"very soon,\" Iran says .\nIranian official says release is scheduled for Saturday morning .\nHikers' mothers say all three are innocent and should be released .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Given the following news article, summarize the article:\n### Input:(CNN) -- Kieren Keke remembers growing up on the Pacific island of Nauru, the world's smallest independent republic. \"The weather patterns were predictable,\" he says. \"There was a wet season and a dry season, an annual cycle. When there was drought, it was limited.\" \"Now it's different,\" he tells CNN. \"There's no predictability -- periods of drought can last seven or eight years, and when we get storms they are more intense. The coastline is being eroded. Now the sea is right up to people's doorsteps.\" Keke is now foreign minister of Nauru, and leads the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) at the current U.N. Climate Change conference in Doha, Qatar. The Alliance is fighting a David-and-Goliath battle with the world's biggest polluters -- trying to shame them into tougher action to limit emissions and curb the warming of the planet. Read more: Project to turn desert green trials in Qatar . The 43 members of the Alliance include countries that are literally disappearing amid rising sea levels. And they accuse the likes of India, China and the United States of not addressing climate change with enough urgency. The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2007 that sea levels would rise between seven and 23 inches (18 and 59 centimeters) this century, but a rate of ice-melt in the Arctic that is much faster than anticipated has prompted many scientists to raise the projection to about one meter, more than three feet. Among those most threatened are the Marshall Islands, halfway between Hawaii and Papua New Guinea. The highest point on the 29 atolls and five islands is 33 feet (10 meters) above sea level. The capital, Majuro, is just three feet above sea level and was inundated by high tides four years ago. Read more: Arab youth offers hope for Doha climate talks . \"Low-lying atolls across the Pacific are slowly vanishing,\" Keke says. In Nauru, too, people don't have many places to go. The island -- which on satellite imagery looks like a white pebble in the deep blue expanse of the Pacific -- is eight square miles (21 square kilometers) and has a population of some 10,000, almost all of whom live on the coastline. The highest point is 200 feet above sea level, but much of the interior has been ravaged by the effects of phosphate mining. And the nearest neighbors are some 180 miles (almost 300 kilometers) away. Keke says the Alliance wants the 190-odd delegations in Doha to \"ramp up their ambitions\" because current scientific projections about the warming planet will otherwise wipe out a number of low-lying states. But time is pressing. The Kyoto Protocol, the only binding international agreement on emissions, expires in less than four weeks. And the Doha conference is due to end later this week. Read more: Greenhouse gases reached record highs in 2011 . \"Some countries are ready to sign up for a second commitment period to Kyoto,\" which would last from 2013 to 2020, Keke says. Among them the European Union and Australia. But Canada, Russia and Japan are among governments that have already said they won't sign onto an extension of Kyoto, a stance that Keke says is \"very disappointing.\" They are demanding that countries like China and India -- now the first and third emitters of greenhouse gases -- to be bound by new targets, along with the industrialized world. China and India, as developing nations, were excused from the commitment adopted at Kyoto by some 40 developed nations to cut their carbon emissions by 5% by this year, compared with the level in 1990. Measuring sea levels among the Pacific islands -- and trying to establish trends -- is complicated by the effects of the weather systems known as El Nino and La Nina, according to climatologists. But beyond the threat of higher sea levels, the warming climate produces more extreme storms, and more acidic water bleaches coral reefs. Then there are the fish. Many of these island states rely on fishing to survive and as a source of revenue, but as ocean temperatures warm, fish move. Tuna don't like it hot and swim toward cooler, nutrient-rich waters. A paper prepared this year by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community forecasts that currents and changes in water temperature will mean that \"tuna are likely to move progressively toward the east\" -- away from the islands of Oceania. \"Traditional food sources and ways of living will be at risk,\" Keke says. AOSIS is asking U.N. officials at Doha not to allow this conference -- the 17th since the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 -- to degenerate into a last-minute take-it-or-leave-it declaration, as have previous sessions of the U.N. Framework on Climate Change. But these conferences have a habit of coming to life only when the main players turn up in the final days, and past meetings have led to shallow agreements that revised the process of negotiation rather than established real commitments. Whether Doha will be much different, and whether Keke and his colleagues from the Alliance of Small Island States will see a glimpse of hope on the horizon, may become clearer by the end of this week. At present they don't sound very optimistic, releasing a statement Monday that reads: \"We begin the final week of negotiations in Doha with the sober recognition that time is running out to prevent the loss of entire nations and other calamities in our membership and around the world.\"\n### Response : ", "target": "Lands in the Alliance of Small Island States are disappearing amid rising sea levels .\nThe Alliance is pressing for action at the current Climate Change conference .\nThe warming climate also produces more extreme storms and affects fishing .\nAlliance members do not sound optimistic about the conference .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Read the following passage and summarize it.(CNN) -- Frank Sinatra is back, crooning 'Fly Me To The Moon' live in his trademark suit and fedora as if he had never left the stage. A decade and a half after Ol' Blue Eyes passed away, this unexpected new appearance has been made possible with an optical technology called Musion Eyeliner. Based on a Victorian-era light projection system called 'Pepper's Ghost' which was developed by two inventors -- Henry Dircks and John Pepper -- in the 1860s, Musion Eyeliner offers a range of spectacular stage effects that, in addition to bringing Frank Sinatra back to life, have been used to reanimate Tupac Shakur, Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley. Uwe Maass, the inventor or Musion Eyeliner, explains that when it was first developed in the 19th century, Pepper's Ghost was quite straightforward: \"The Pepper's Ghost system is relatively simple. It is a piece of foil in a 45 degree angle and it reflects the image from the floor onto the stage.\" From the audience's perspective the light projection can offer all kinds of effects including making realistic 3-D people appear on stage.\" Maass -- an accomplished electronic engineer with 30 years experience in optics -- advanced the concept of Pepper's Ghost with modern video projection and animation techniques that serve to update the old technology. Maass's main innovation is to replace the glass used in original systems with an invisible polymer foil to offer a more substantial image while also allowing the stage behind to remain visible. Maass's developments quickly attracted interest from senior figures around the entertainment industry: . \"I first thought of it 15 years ago and I filed a patent application using foil for a Pepper's Ghost system and two weeks later I got phone calls from Steven Spielberg's people. They came to my office (as well as representatives) from Disney and Siegfried and Roy ... David Copperfield came personally,\" Maass says. Even though it has been around since the 90s, Musion Eyeliner really came to prominence in 2006 when Madonna performed alongside the animated British band Gorillaz at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards. Since then the technology has been used by Universal Studios, Disney, and Sony, as well as performers including ABBA, Will.i.am, Mick Jagger, and Mariah Carey, as well as Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre in their famous performance alongside Tupac at Coachella in 2012. Maass is also working with artists to help create shows that bring together members whose schedules clash: \"We got a lot of good response from the artists Black Eyed Peas (and) Will.i.am,\" Maass says. \"They're really pleased with the system because in France they couldn't travel all together, so we had two of the group members virtually on stage and performing together, interacting together with the rest of the group who were real on stage.\" The system has also been used to simulcast events and performances around the world: . \"Another application is teleconferencing ... You can have one performance on one stage that is live and then you can have a hundred performances at the same time all over the world with the same concert,\" says Maass. Resurrecting performers of the past comes with a complex of legal, technical and ethical questions, but has nevertheless been proving popular with audiences around the world. Maass says that his company's next main project is to help Cirque du Soleil bring the work of Michael Jackson back to life in the 'Immortal World Tour'. In an interview with Ebony Magazine in 2007 Michael Jackson said \"Music has been my outlet, my gift to all of the lovers in this world.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?\n### Input :Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon said he is set to meet with Moammar Gadhafi on Wednesday in an attempt to persuade Libya's embattled ruler to step down. Weldon will also meet with Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid Khaim, the Republican from Pennsylvania said in an interview with CNN affiliate WPIX-TV. Weldon said that in addition to Gadhafi's resignation, he is proposing a cease-fire on both sides; a withdrawal of government forces from key cities; no further advances by rebel forces; a joint interim government run by Libya's current prime minister and the an opposition leader; unfettered humanitarian access; and the establishment of a parliamentary commission that would include American, Middle Eastern, European and African politicians helping to establish a new parliament in Libya. As far as the Gadhafi family, Weldon's proposals also suggest a possible title for Gadhafi as honorary chairman of the African Union and allowing his second-oldest son, Saif, to stand in elections. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi was once thought of as a leading reformer in the Libyan government, but the 38-year-old has become one of his father's most outspoken defenders since the start of the unrest. In an opinion piece written for The New York Times, Weldon said, \"I've met (Moammar Gadhafi) enough times to know that it will be very hard to simply bomb him into submission.\" He said he was in Libya at the invitation of Gadhafi and that U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is aware of the trip. CNN did not immediately get a response late Tuesday night from the U.S. State Department or the White House about Weldon's trip. In 2004, Weldon led a congressional delegation to Tripoli and met privately with Gadhafi after the Libyan leader renounced terrorism in an effort to establish warmer ties with the West. Weldon said in his opinion piece Wednesday that he traveled in 2004 to support Gadhafi's decision to give up Libya's nuclear weapons program, though neither he nor the White House wanted to support Gadhafi himself. Weldon told CNN in 2004 that he had 14 meetings with \"everyone in the administration\" and toured a nuclear complex. Libya remains in a deadly stalemate as pro-Gadhafi forces battle rebel fighters demanding an end to Gadhafi's nearly 42-year-rule.

{"source": "### Instruction:Produce an article summary of the following news article:Doc to summarize:\n### Input:(CNN) -- Despite the obvious claims of younger rivals Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, few can really argue with the 96 football journalists who voted Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite as the 2007 World Footballer of the Year. Brazilian genius Kaka fully deserves winning the 2007 World Footballer of the Year award. The prestigious Ballon d'Or award is widely regarded as the most prestigious individual prize in football and Kaka's inclusion on its coveted roll of honor is a testament to the 25-year-old Brazilian's current standing in world football. When AC Milan defeated Liverpool in the Champions League final in Athens, avenging their heartbreaking loss to the same team in Istanbul two years previously, it enabled Kaka to fulfill his dream of holding aloft Europe's premier trophy -- a winner's medal he fully deserved after a sublime 90-minute performance. Kaka's stock for both club and country has risen steadily since his move to the San Siro from Sao Paulo for a fee of just $8.5 million in the summer of 2003. Unlike many a Brazilian sporting genius, Kaka did not hone his skills on the beach or the streets of a favela shanty town. He was born into a comfortable middle class Brasilia family, where football was not the only hope of a bright future. However, it soon became clear that this particular boy had a very special skill and he was signed by Sao Paulo, after his family had moved there, at just eight years of age -- making his first team debut as an 18-year-old. Kaka's progress was soon picked up by his national team coach and Felipe Scolari named the graceful midfielder in his 23-man squad for the 2002 World Cup finals, earning him a winners' medal despite playing only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against Costa Rica. A year later, and Kaka was on his way to Milan. Within a month he had made the starting line-up and his 10 goals helped the Rossoneri lift the Scudetto and the European Super Cup. Throughout his career, Kaka has always possessed the innate ability to score goals -- his record for both club and country sees him average roughly a goal every three games. Yet to describe Kaka merely as a goalscoring midfielder would be doing him a massive injustice. Tall, elegant and blessed with astonishing skill, Milan and Brazil utilize Kaka's ability superbly. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti soon recognized Kaka's genius, changing his team's system to a 4-4-1-1, playing the Brazilian behind a main target man. With Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso holding the central midfield area, Kaka has a license to roam in behind the lone striker, be it Filippo Inzaghi, Ronaldo or Alberto Gilardino. And Kaka does this with devastating effect, running at the opposition with pace and power, finding defense-splitting passes or shooting from range with deadly accuracy be it from a dead-ball situation or open play. The fly in the ointment for Milan comes in the shape of their poor form this season. Although they have already reached the last 16 of the Champions League, the club are floundering in Serie A and face the unthinkable prospect of not qualifying for next season's competition unless they win the trophy. Real Madrid have coveted Kaka for the last two years -- expect the world transfer record to be smashed if Milan don't secure a place among Europe's elite.

More than 390 Palestinians have been killed, according to Palestinian medical sources, and some 1,900 people have been wounded, including 400 women and children. Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniya, whose office in Gaza was struck overnight, said Israel needed to \"stop attacking and killing our children, women and men.\" \"The aggression must stop, the crossings must open and the blockade must be lifted and then we can talk about all other issues,\" he said in televised comments Wednesday. \"Then we can start a national dialogue without any preset conditions.\" Israeli sources say four Israelis have been killed by Palestinian rocket fire. The Israeli air force carried out about 40 airstrikes Wednesday, and Palestinian militants fired about 70 rockets into Israel, the IDF said. More than 30 rockets landed in southern Israel on Wednesday, including at least four in Beer Sheva, Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld said. Beer Sheva, about 25 miles away from Gaza, is the farthest that rockets from Gaza have ever landed inside Israel. \"Israel will not accept a 'Strip of Terror' alongside us, and accordingly Hamas operatives have tasted the flavor of Israel's response in the last few days,\" Israeli President Shimon Peres said.

Police Chief Cathy Lanier told reporters Tuesday, adding that the cause of death was suicide. Lanier said Tuesday she was \"hoping to finish the search of the park by the close of the day\" Wednesday. The search for Relisha intensified last week when authorities began combing Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens. The search was prompted by evidence that Tatum had spent time there after Relisha's disappearance. \"On March 2, we know that Mr. Tatum purchased, among other items, a carton of black, 42-gallon, self-tie contractor trash bags within the District of Columbia,\" Lanier said Thursday. \"Not long after that purchase, Mr. Tatum was in the area of the aquatic gardens for a period of time.\" Lanier said after Relisha was last seen, Tatum continued to go to work and was seen around the capital several times between March 2 and March 20. Lanier said Relisha was not with Tatum in any of those sightings. Tatum had not been seen since March 20. Tatum was a janitor for the homeless shelter where Relisha's family had been staying, and it appears Tatum had permission to be with the girl. The case took on new urgency when police discovered the body of Tatum's wife, Andrea Denise Tatum, 51, at a suburban Maryland motel. That discovery prompted police to issue an Amber Alert for Relisha. The search for the girl has been extensive. Lanier told reporters Monday that \"hundreds of police officers and firefighter cadets\" had been pulled to help with the search, along with divers, underwater cameras, aerial surveillance, search dogs, and cadaver dogs. \"Our primary focus here was to find Relisha,\" Lanier said Monday. \"We're not finished.

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the central ideas presented?\n### Input:Washington (CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration proposed two new rules Friday that it estimates could eliminate up to 1.25 million foodborne illnesses each year from such pathogens as Salmonella, Listeria and E. Coli. The new regulations are part of the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act, which aims to make the agency more proactive at preventing outbreaks. Each year one out of every six Americans gets sick from foodborne illnesses, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly 128,000 people are hospitalized and 3,000 die. \"We really need to do more than react after the fact,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg said in a news briefing. \"Preventing problems before they cause harm is not only common sense, it is key to food safety in the 21st century.\" One rule requires \"science-based standards for growing, harvesting, packing and holding produce on domestic and foreign farms.\" It addresses a variety of possible routes of food contamination including the manure used as fertilizer, water sprayed on crops, animals in the fields, whether workers wash their hands and how packing houses process foods. The other rule sets out guidelines for \"preventive controls for human food\" and would require companies to have plans for foodborne illnesses. \"It's basic common sense,\" said Michael Taylor, FDA deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine. \"In each individual facility the operator simply must identify the potential hazards, identify the controls that can work ... to reduce those hazards, implement those controls on a continuing basis, document, keep records and then make corrections when needed.\" The two proposed rules will be available for public comment for 120 days. If they go into effect as written, companies would have up to four years, depending on their size, to comply. Food safety advocates applauded the new rules. \"This is a really important step toward food safety standards that would prevent contamination whether it is produced in a food factory or being produced on a farm,\" said Chris Waldrop, director of the Food Policy Institute at the Consumer Federation of America. \"Unfortunately, It took a series of large foodborne illness outbreaks to make people wake up and say this is a problem that needs to be addressed.\" Salmonella in peanut butter sickened 42 people last fall and cantaloupes tainted with Listeria infected 146 people and killed 30 in 2011, according to the CDC. \"You can just look at a couple of recent outbreaks that were quite serious in terms of burden of illnesses and they occurred because of problems that would have been addressed by these kinds of approaches,\" Hamburg said, without referencing specific incidents. Still, concerns remain over whether the agency will be able to make the new rules work as intended. \"One of the key questions here is resources for FDA and making sure that FDA has enough money, enough resources to enforce this,\" Waldrop said. When asked about the cost of the program, Hamburg was not able to provide a price tag. \"It's difficult to answer both in terms of overall cost and initial cost to implement,\" she said. \"There will also be savings overall to the system and new efficiencies, and of course prevention of problems that would have taken a toll both in health and on industry and health care.\" The agency expects private companies will enforce the new guidelines on their suppliers and counts on partnerships with local governments to help police them. \"FDA may do some inspections, but we have limited resources to inspect produce operations and we have a clear direction from Congress to collaborate with state agencies so we expect much of the oversight to come at the state and local level,\" Taylor said. The FDA says additional rules are expected, including those addressing foreign suppliers, animal food and third -party auditors. CNN's Athena Jones contributed to this report.\n### Response :", "target": "Rules address produce safety and preventive controls for human food .\nThey will be available for public comment for 120 days .\nThe goal is to prevent outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, FDA commissioner says .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?(CNN) -- Authorities in Texas shot and killed an escaped prisoner early Saturday, several days after they say he stabbed a detective tasked with taking him across the country. Alberto Morales, 42, was killed shortly after he was located in a wooded area in Grapevine, near Dallas, said Grapevine Police Department spokesman Sgt. Robert Eberling. With the help of a helicopter, authorities found Morales not far from a home where someone stole jewelery and men's clothing. \"At this point, as far as the investigation is concerned, Mr. Morales was shot and is now deceased. This matter is still under investigation ... and we'll have more details at a later point,\" Eberling told reporters. He declined to say whether the escapee was armed and did not elaborate on the circumstances surrounding Morales' death. Eberling stressed the case remains under investigation. Morales' death ended a manhunt that began on Monday. It was then that police say he stabbed a Florida detective multiple times and disappeared. That detective, and another, had been transporting Morales from Florida to Nevada. The trip began on a Miami-Houston-Las Vegas flight. Prior to landing in Houston, Morales began \"acting erratically,\" according to a statement from the Miami-Dade Police Department. As a result, he and the detectives were not allowed to board their connecting flight, it said. The detectives rented a vehicle and continued on their way, making a pit stop in Grapevine to use the restroom. While one of the detectives was inside, Morales stabbed Det. Jaime Pardinas, a 28-year veteran, multiple times, and fled the scene, authorities said. Pardinas was treated at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas and was listed in serious condition, the statement said. Morales was arrested in Nevada in 2008. He was brought to Miami, where he was jailed pending a 2003 case alleging burglary, kidnapping and sexual battery. In December, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which was to run consecutive to a Nevada sentence. Details of Morales' Nevada case were not immediately known. When asked by a reporter how authorities felt at the conclusion of the manhunt, Eberling said he was relieved for local residents. \"We knew we had a dangerous individual out there in the streets. And he was capable of being extremely violent. So that is what we're relieved of. The fact that Mr. Morales is now deceased is not something that we celebrate, but our jobs is to apprehend the fugitive,\" he said. \"It is a relief to this community and I think a lot of folks in this area can now have a moment of rest.\"\n### Response: ", "target": "Alberto Morales, 42, was shot early Saturday .\nHe escaped from custody Monday, after allegedly stabbing a detective .\nAuthorities tracked Morales to a wooded area near where a home was burglarized .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Until recently, they had lived a quiet life in an upper-class neighborhood in the Mexican city of Monterrey. But they're now at the center of a national gay rights debate in Mexico. Their 2-year-old daughter, the couple says, was expelled from a private school in Monterrey for having two fathers. Alex and Pepe were married in Mexico City, where same-sex marriage is legally sanctioned. They asked CNN not to make their last names public to protect their daughter's identity. Alex, a 28-year-old who works in marketing and sales, is the girl's biological father. Pepe is a 39-year-old broker with a degree from the University of Miami. The couple says an administrator at The Hills Institute, which also has a daycare facility, told them they would have to hide the fact that they're a same-sex couple if they wanted the girl to stay at their school. \"They were asking me to give up all of my rights as parent at the school,\" Alex told Telediario Monterrey, a local independent TV station. \"I would've had to not participate in school or social activities. I was to not communicate with anybody nor attend together, as a family, Mother's Day or Father's Day celebrations as long as she was attending the school.\" The couple found the conditions unacceptable and the school called the parents to the school a few days later only to give them the news that girl had been officially expelled. \"They saw us through the door's window and locked the door,\" Pepe told Telediario. \"The receptionist went to the back of the office. After waiting for 10 minutes, they sent an employee escorted by a security guard to tell us that the girl had been officially expelled. CNN's calls and e-mail to officials at The Hills Institute so far have gone unanswered. On its website, The Hills Institute says their vision is to become \"the best bicultural school in Mexico's educational system.\" According to Alex and Pepe, the couple attended the school's open house in mid-August. They say they made it clear to school personnel that they were a legally married couple and had legal custody of the child. No issues were raised by the school, the parents said. The girl was expelled September 13. Last week, Alex and Pepe made the decision to file complaints with two agencies in Mexico. The couple filed a complaint with the Nuevo Leon state department of public education claiming that regardless of their family's composition, or whether the school is private or not, it is illegal to deny a child an education in Mexico, based on the Mexican Constitution's anti-discrimination protections. They also filed a complaint with the Mexican agency that protects consumers saying the school has yet to refund their money. Alex says a check the school sent bounced. In a letter to the Nuevo Leon state secretary of education, a spokesman for the LGBT community in Monterrey denounced the girl's dismissal from the school. Mario Alberto Rodriguez wrote that he believes the incident \"violates several legal statutes ... in detriment of the rights of the minor.\" Article 1 of the Mexican Constitution states that \"discrimination on the basis of ethnic or national origin, gender, age, disability status, social status, health, religion, political persuasion, sexual orientation, civil status or any other that infringes against human dignity or diminishes rights or liberties of the people is hereby prohibited.\" The Nuevo Leon state constitution mirrors that prohibition. Alex and Pepe say they decided to go public because they feel it's the only way authorities will do something about their case. \"Our daughter has been discriminated against in the most vicious way,\" Pepe told CNN. As for the little girl, her parents say they're looking for an alternative school while trying to explain to her why she can't see her friends anymore. Journalist Daniela Mendoza contributed to this report.\n### Response : ", "target": "Alex and Pepe file complaints after their daughter is expelled from a Mexican day school .\nThey say she was kicked out because they refused to hide the fact they are gay .\nThe Mexican constitution's non-discrimination clause applies, they say .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary that explains everything about this article for meCan you provide a brief rundown of the text?\n### Input:Washington (CNN) -- Embattled Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi's forces have made significant strides against rebel fighters, as the United Nations is working quickly to pass a resolution authorizing international intervention, a senior State Department official told senators Thursday. In remarks to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, William Burns, the undersecretary for political affairs at the State Department, said Gadhafi's forces are only about 160 kilometers (about 100 miles) outside of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. \"They've made advances taking full advantage of their overwhelming military superiority in military fire power,\" Burns said. Burns expressed fear that Gadhafi, now isolated by the world community, could turn to terrorism again. \"I think there is also a very real danger that if Gadhafi is successful on the ground, that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well -- the danger of him returning to terrorism, and violent extremism himself, the dangers of the turmoil that he could help create at a critical moment elsewhere in the region,\" Burns told the committee. Senators, in turn, expressed frustration with the lack of progress by the United States in responding to Gadhafi beyond sanctions and warnings, as the U.S. tries to build international consensus for any military intervention. \"When is that resolution going to happen, after the bloodbath, in the middle of the bloodbath?\" asked Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. The United Nations Security Council is meeting in New York Thursday, debating forceful options that would go beyond a no-fly zone, Burns told the senators. A vote is schedule for Thursday evening. When Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, asked what those options would include, such as targeted air strikes on Gadhafi's weapons, jamming of government radio signals, and using the tens of billions of dollars in Gadhafi's assets that have been frozen, Burns would only say that diplomats are talking about a \"whole range of measures,\" including a number of the steps Menendez mentioned. \"We are pursuing -- along with the Lebanese, the British, French, other partners in the council -- measures that include a no-fly zone, but could go beyond that.,\" Burns said. \"And I can't in this session, since the debate is going on the Security Council right now, go into a lot of detail about that. But there are measures short of boots on the ground that could be taken by the international community, including active air participation.\" Burns' remarks echoed White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, who said Thursday that the United States is still \"actively considering\" the imposition of a no-fly zone over Libya, and that U.S. officials also are examining other options to put pressure on the Gadhafi regime. With the ground situation evolving in Libya, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice said previously this week that there are \"inherent limitations\" regarding a no-fly zone \"in terms of protecting civilians.\" The U.S. military does not view a no-fly zone as sufficient to stopping Gadhafi. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Norton Schwartz told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday that establishing such a zone \"would not be sufficient\" to stop the gains made by Gadhafi. Schwartz told the committee that establishing a no-fly zone would take \"upwards of a week.\" Defense Secretary Robert Gates has cautioned about the use of a no-fly zone in the past weeks, saying it would involve a military attack on Libya to take out air defenses. On Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said Gates' concern extends to other potential military operations in Libya. \"It would be logical if one of his concerns about a no-fly zone is the element of attacking Libyan air defenses, then an option of air strikes would be pretty similar,\" Lapan told reporters at the Pentagon. Burns expects the U.N. Security council to come to an agreement on a resolution Thursday, but wants both operational and financial support from Arab states on the measures decided upon. \"Those are discussions that we've begun including with particular Arab states that have expressed an interest and a willingness to participate in this,\" Burns said.\n### Response :", "target": "Gadhafi's forces have made significant advances against rebels, an official says .\nThe official briefs a Senate panel on the situation in Libya .\nSenators express frustration with U.S. response to Gadhafi so far .\nThe U.N.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?\n### Input:(CNN) -- An Indiana lawmaker who opposes celebrating the centennial anniversary of the Girl Scouts of America says the group \"sexualizes\" young girls, promotes homosexuality and is a tactical arm of Planned Parenthood. In a letter sent to members of the Republican Caucus, Indiana state Rep. Bob Morris said many parents were \"abandoning the Girl Scouts because they promote homosexual lifestyles.\" \"As members of the Indiana House of Representatives, we must be wise before we use the credibility and respect of the 'Peoples' House' to extend legitimacy to a radicalized organization,\" Morris said, warning lawmakers not \"to endorse a group that has been subverted in the name of liberal progressive politics and the destruction of traditional American family values.\" In the Saturday letter, obtained by CNN affiliate WRTV-TV in Indianapolis, Morris lobbied lawmakers to oppose a nonbinding resolution celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Girl Scouts. Morris was the only member not to sign the measure. After doing what he called a \"small amount\" of research on the Internet, Morris said, he and his wife concluded the Girl Scouts have become a tactical arm of Planned Parenthood and are part of an agenda that includes \"sexualizing\" young girls. Morris' two daughters have been pulled from the Girl Scouts, he said, and instead will become active in American Heritage Girls Little Flowers organization -- a group that \"will not confuse their conservative Hoosier upbringing.\" Morris said he takes the stand despite the knowledge that \"99.9% of Girl Scout troops in this country\" are run by good leaders, he told WRTV. The concern, he said, is where the money goes on the national level. In a statement, the Girl Scouts said, \"Regarding Representative Morris, if the freshman representative wishes to discredit the contributions that hundreds of thousands of Indiana women and girls have made through the Girl Scouts program over the last 100 years, then he's entitled to his opinion. \"Not only is Rep. Morris off the mark on his claims, it's also unfortunate in his limited research that he failed to discover that since 1917, every first lady has served as the honorary leader of Girl Scouts, including Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush.\" Betty Cockrum, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Indiana, said she was disappointed in Morris' words, calling them \"inflammatory, misleading, woefully inaccurate and harmful.\" The controversy is the latest involving Planned Parenthood and its affiliates. The Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation briefly cut funding for some Planned Parenthood projects, saying it decided it would no longer fund groups under federal investigation. Congress in September began investigating whether Planned Parenthood illegally used federal funds to provide abortions. After Komen's initial decision, Planned Parenthood said money from the foundation has largely paid for breast exams at local centers. In the past five years, it said, grants from Komen have directly supported 170,000 screenings, making up about 4% of the exams performed at Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide. Karen Handel, a vice president with the Komen Foundation, resigned her position this month following uproar over Komen's actions. In stark contrast to his colleague, Indiana House Speaker Brian Bosma, also a Republican, handed out Girl Scout cookies on the floor of the General Assembly on Tuesday. \"There are a lot of sideshows at the General Assembly ... and all walks of life, and you just have to determine which ones you're going to go into,\" Bosma told CNN affiliate WISH-TV in Indianapolis.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?(CNN) -- It was not a blanket of snow that fell on the Northeast this past weekend. It was more like a futon of snow. A stack of futons. And not the light foam futons, but old-fashioned futons stuffed with horsehair or maybe potting soil. Sodden futons stacked 3 feet high with no place to shovel them. But ignore my bitterness. I'm old and I just got in from shoveling the part of our driveway that the next civic-minded city plow is going to refill. In truth, New England handled this snow emergency like a champ -- so much better than the Blizzard of '78 in which people died stuck in their cars on the highway. But before we break out the cocoa and self-congratulations, we might want to listen to Espen Andersen, a Norwegian in Oslo who lived in Boston for nine years. I blogged on Saturday about how well-prepared the Northeast was, and Espen jumped in with a \"Yeah, but ...\" comment. \"I just can't get used to the New England oh-my-God-here-it-comes-again-flip-to-channel-5 attitude,\" he wrote. He explained: \"The fact that New England panics every time there is a flurry is due to lack of preparedness at the infrastructure level. In most of Norway, power and telephone lines are underground, it is illegal not to have snow tires on your car after December 1st or thereabouts (if you go in the ditch, you are fined) and during my own and my children's school days we have never had a snow day or any other interruption due to the weather (and we have plenty of weather). I have never been to the store to stock up on batteries and water. ... Our airport does not close down for snow, though there can be delays.\" My pride makes me want to push back on the idea that we New Englanders \"panic\" in the face of blizzards, not to mention that referring to this past weekend's unpleasantness as \"a flurry\" goes beyond Nordic stoicism. On the other hand, I remember being amused as a grad student watching the recent immigrants from sunny Mediterranean climes spinning their tires in a modest Toronto snowfall. What goes around comes around, and those Mediterranean tires were going around at an unmoving 60 mph. But Espen raises a valid question: \"Why doesn't New England harden the grid and communications systems, put winter tires on school buses, mandate winter tires in snowy conditions and just get rid of this stupid idea of snow days? It is winter; it happens almost every year.\" I'd suggest there are two reasons we don't. We'd all like to see the poles and wires that blight our landscape come down. Not only would this reduce power outages due to downed trees, it might also give us an opportunity to pull some optical fiber into our homes and businesses so that the United States could stop falling behind the developed world in high-speed Internet access. So let's do it. Except, it's expensive. All those trenches to dig. All those rights of way to clear. All those transformers to move indoors. The bullet to bite is so large that we're more willing to dribble out the price of sending out repair crews, and to put up with the far more substantial costs borne by individuals and businesses that go without power for hours, days and sometimes weeks. The aggregated cost of being without electricity for the 655,000 people plunged into the cold and dark by the so-called Nemo storm, are distributed among the sufferers, and thus that cost is invisible, as is everything if one closes one's eyes hard enough. Besides, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick estimated that it would cost $1 trillion to bury all the power lines throughout the commonwealth. Various experts I consulted (via the advanced knowledge network known as mailing lists) supplied counter guesstimates of $45 billion to $200 billion, but with caveats about everything from the frequency of buried rocks to the increased difficulty of fixing broken underground cables. Still, that's between three and 70 Big Digs, to use our local unit of currency. Not chump change, no matter how you measure it. Which brings us to the second reason we don't bite the bullet and snow-proof our infrastructure: We think of snowstorms as emergencies that inevitably bring with them power outages and snow days, so we don't demand a snow-proof infrastructure. Yes, this is circular reasoning. We don't demand a fix because we don't see the system as broken. It takes a Norwegian to have us wonder why we're shutting down our cities as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Even if we overcame both reasons and buried our power and communication lines, I doubt that we would escape all snow-caused work stoppages. Maybe I'm just being a panicky New Englander, but when 2 to 3 feet of snow drops on your city so fast that you can practically hear the thump, I can't imagine how we'd get our streets and trolley tracks cleaned fast enough to avoid a day when it's better if everyone just stays at home, does some shoveling and watches \"Buffy\" seasons 1-4. For, as Espen points out, if we didn't treat snow as an emergency, we wouldn't get our snow days. And we love our snow days.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you outline the content?Washington (CNN) -- About half the schools in Tennessee didn't meet the annual yearly progress requirements of the No Child Left Behind law last year. Tennessee is not alone. Saying schools are struggling to meet the student progress requirements of the No Child Left Behind law, the White House announced Monday it would be signing waivers that will relieve schools of some of the key provisions of the law. \"The law -- No Child Left Behind -- as it currently stands is four years overdue for being rewritten. It is far too punitive, it is far too prescriptive, lead to a dummying down of standards, lead to a narrowing of the curriculum,\" Education Secretary Arne Duncan said at a White House press briefing on Monday. \"We can't afford to have the law of the land be one that has so many perverse incentives or disincentives to the kind of progress that we want to see.\" The law requires that all students meet reading and math adequacy by 2014. If they don't, the schools are subject to reforms. As the standards have increased annually, schools are finding it increasingly difficult to meet them. \"We hope that this is simply a transition or bridge to fixing the law,\" Duncan said of the waiver plans. Rather than a large sweeping bill to reauthorize the entire Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), also known as No Child Left Behind Act, Rep. John Kline's committee has been working on smaller, more specific bills throughout the summer, to address ESEA concerns. The Republican-led House Education and the Workforce committee has passed three bills intended to streamline education programs, address charter school issues and give states and localities more flexibility in spending their federal dollars. These bills have not yet made it to the House floor for debate, nor have they come up in the Democratic-led Senate for debate. Only one of the bills -- the one on charter schools -- passed out of the House committee with bipartisan support. The committee is expected to take up separate legislation on teacher effectiveness and accountability this fall. \"I remain concerned that temporary measures instituted by the Department (of Education), such as conditional waivers, could undermine the committee's efforts to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,\" Kline, R-Minnesota, said in a statement Friday. Duncan said the Education Department will announce the standards under which the waivers will be granted in September but in the meantime, they encourage all states to apply. Duncan said he had talked to more than 30 governors about the waiver plan. \"I have not spoken to one governor that wasn't very enthusiastic about this,\" he said. Tennessee applied for a waiver to the law late last month, according to Kelli Gauthier of the Department of Education there. Without a waiver, Tennessee would be \"responsible for intervening in a large number of its 'failing' schools; a role the department has neither the desire nor the capacity to take on,\" according to Gauthier. Tennessee is still waiting to see if Secretary Duncan approves their request.\n### Response:", "target": "Education Secretary Duncan hopes this is transition to fix for law .\nCurrent law leads \"to a dummying down of standards\"\nHouse panel has passed 3 education-related bills .\nHead of panel says he's concerned about temporary measures .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Given the following news article, summarize the article:(CNN) -- About a decade ago, while walking through the spring training clubhouse of the then-Florida Marlins, a third baseman summoned me toward his locker and -- pants down, while changing out of his uniform -- farted in my face. I did not know the man. He did not know me. He simply thought, in some odd way, that farting into a stranger's face constituted good humor. And, amazingly, it did. Teammates laughed and laughed and laughed. Ultimately, a catcher I'd interviewed before walked up, tapped me on the shoulder and said, \"Typical bull----.\" Indeed. The professional athlete who breaks wind in a man's face is not an anomaly. Neither is the athlete who -- as a joke -- sticks a pornographic film in the clubhouse TV's DVD player. Or the one who gives a teammate a wedgie. Or a purple nurple. Or tells racist jokes. Or sexist jokes. Or ... you name it. Really, name anything. That's why, as the world -- in and out of sporting -- chatters over the 144-page report commissioned by the NFL to explore allegations of bullying within the Miami Dolphins, I can't help but sigh, shrug and accept the reality that -- even with Richie Incognito's warranted public flogging, even with Michael Sam's announcement of his homosexuality, even with continued societal enlightenment -- little will change. As anyone who has spent time covering athletics will tell you, life in a male professional clubhouse is often akin to the worst fraternity on campus -- minus the rules, regulations and governing bodies. There is a caste system, but it has little to do with the most intelligent and mature rising to the top. Here, the skinny backup quarterback who attended, say, Harvard or Northwestern gains no points for his pedigree. The strong debater or the Tolstoy fan isn't considered a guide or guru. No, this is the heartland of Richie Incognitos -- large, loud, oafish dunderheads who would be branded bullies elsewhere but are here leaders. As the NFL report detailed, Incognito and Co. appeared to take a sadistic pleasure in torturing Jonathan Martin, a teammate considered to be weak. Ted Wells, a defense lawyer who investigated the scandal and produced the report for the NFL, called it \"a classic case of bullying, where persons who are in a position of power harass the less powerful\" -- and truer words have rarely been written. Martin was mocked racially, mocked sexually, subjected to obscene jokes about his sister and mother. Another teammate, according to the report, was besieged with homophobic taunts and touched in a \"mockingly suggestive manner.\" This is awful. This is not particularly surprising. Truth be told, the world of professional team sports is about as open-minded as a corpse. Yes, blacks and whites and Hispanics and Asians come together to fight for a common goal. Winning. Once the final whistle or buzzer sounds (or the last out is recorded), the \"Kumbaya\" spirit evaporates, and everyone wanders off into their groups and corners. Many go about their lives. Some -- the meek -- cower. Others -- the Incognitos -- pounce. They do so for the simple reason that others before them have also done so -- no one dares stand in the way. I vividly recall covering the San Francisco Giants when Barry Bonds was the team's star. He was (to be blunt) an awful man to others -- rude to teammates, dismissive to fans, crude to the media and indifferent to Giants employees. When a San Francisco front office executive or public relations official would tiptoe up to Bonds with a question or request, he would be unceremoniously rebuffed. He might technically have held the power, but Bonds was bigger, stronger, more famous, more important -- and his way became the way. No matter what the so-called experts say on the morning talk shows (and Lord knows, it'd be helpful if some of them ever even stepped foot inside a locker room), that's how it goes in sports. Unless pro sports commissioners Roger Goodell, Bud Selig, Adam Silver and Gary Bettman make a concerted effort to begin enforcing better behavior in their sports' respective locker rooms, that's how it will always go in sports. And the Richie Incognitos will continue to rule the terrain.

In Beijing, the gateway for flights to Pyongyang, Rodman told Reuters he was on another \"basketball diplomacy tour\" and would not be discussing the release of Bae. \"I'm not going to North Korea to discuss freeing Kenneth Bae,\" Rodman told Reuters in a telephone interview before he left Beijing for Pyongyang. \"I've come out here to see my friend (Kim) -- and I want to talk about basketball,\" he added. Later pushing through a throng of journalists at Beijing airport, the 6 foot 7 inch (2.01 meter) former basketballer said: \"I'm just trying to go over there to meet my friend Kim, the Marshal. Try to start a basketball league over there, something like that.\" In May: Rodman asks Kim Jong Un to let U.S. citizen go . However, he told the Huffington Post last week that he would likely broach the issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \"I gave (Kim Jong-un) a great indication of when I'm going to Beijing soon -- that's just a hop, skip and a jump from North Korea. So basically, you know, I'm pretty sure I'll be talking to him soon,\" Rodman told the Huffington Post. Rodman is North Korean leader's 'friend for life' \"I will definitely ask for Kenneth Bae's release,\" he said. \"I will say, 'Marshal, why is this guy held hostage?' I could try and soften it up in that way.\" \"If the Marshal says, 'Dennis, you know, do you want me to let him loose?' and then if I actually got him loose -- and I'm just saying this out the blue -- I'd be the most powerful guy in the world.\" Rodman's trip -- which is being sponsored by Irish bookmaker Paddy Power -- is the second to the hardline Communist state this year. In March, Rodman was pictured with Kim, an ardent basketball fan, laughing and eating while watching an all-star basketball match. He was criticized over the trip which came at a time of escalating tension, with North Korea threatening missile strikes on the U.S., South Korea and Japan. Rodman has previously made no secret about his desire to help Bae. He once tweeted that he wanted the 30-year-old unchallenged leader of North Korea to \"do him a solid\" by freeing him. Bae was sentenced to 15 years hard labor in February after he was convicted of unspecified \"hostile acts\" against North Korea. The country's state-run Korean Central News Agency said the Korean-American was arrested late last year after arriving as a tourist in Rason City, a northeastern port near the Chinese border.

But, said Sanford's interim Police Chief Richard Myers, he still supports the programs. \"Neighborhood watch is at work in literally thousands of neighborhoods across the country and with no problems whatsoever,\" Myers told CNN's Erin Burnett on Tuesday. \"I think the problems emerge from who the person is and perhaps there's a cause for communities to take a good, hard look at who is selected or who volunteers. \"Let's not kill the concept because of one bad, really bad outcome.\" Myers, a former police chief from Colorado Springs, Colorado, took the post Friday. He said he has plans to help the department that has been under the microscope since the February 26 killing of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Martin was black; Zimmerman is Hispanic. \"I'm here to help the community. There's a lot of healing that has to take place,\" Myers said. \"I'm here to help the department get some stability.\" His predecessor, Bill Lee, stepped aside as chief after a vote of no-confidence by city commissioners in April, clearing the way for Myers. The Martin case drew nationwide protests when Sanford police decided against arresting Zimmerman, who told investigators he killed Martin in self-defense. A special prosecutor assigned to look into Martin's death ultimately brought second-degree murder charges against the 28-year-old Zimmerman, who has pleaded not guilty and is out on a $150,000 bail. Myers, a 35-year law enforcement veteran, acknowledged the Sanford police department needs to rebuild its relationship with African-Americans in the area. \"One of my major goals is to try and strengthen the relationship that Sanford police have with all elements of the community, especially the African-American community,\" he said. \"In America today, there still exists a great deal of unresolved tension about race and policing and I have a particular passion for working on those issues and helping to resolve conflict. So whether or not that was a factor in this case, it certainly is a factor in some tension that exists. We're going to work on that.\" Myers began his career in the suburbs of Detroit and Chicago before becoming chief of the Appleton, Wisconsin, police department.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you encapsulate this?One of the most high-profile women accused of connections with Mexico's drug trade was extradited to the United States Thursday, officials said. Mexican police handed over Sandra Avila Beltran, known as \"The Queen of the Pacific,\" to U.S. marshals at an airport in central Mexico Thursday morning, Mexico's Attorney General's Office said in a statement. She will face cocaine trafficking charges in a federal court in Florida, prosecutors said. 14 bodies found in Mexico . Avila was once a key drug trafficking link between Colombia and Mexico, prosecutors have said. She was arrested in Mexico City on September 28, 2007, smiling before cameras as authorities trumpeted her detention. Since then, her life has been the subject of a best-selling book and a popular ballad. \"The more beautiful the rose, the sharper the thorns,\" says one line in \"The Queen of Queens,\" Los Tigres del Norte's song describing Avila. Her eye-catching nickname has regularly made headlines as Mexico's case against her made its way through the nation's courts. A judge convicted her on money laundering charges, but ruled that Mexican prosecutors didn't provide enough evidence to convict her of drug trafficking. In 2011, authorities in Mexico City said they were investigating a tip that prison medical personnel had allowed a doctor to give Avila a Botox injection. Avila denied that accusation, Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency reported. For more than two years, Avila has tried to block a U.S. extradition request. A Mexican judge ruled that she could be extradited in June. A 2008 U.S. Congressional Research Service report described Avila as \"a senior member of the Sinaloa cartel who was instrumental\" in building ties with Colombian traffickers. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Avila was suspected of conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States along with Juan Diego Espinosa, a Colombian national who was also known as \"The Tiger.\" 4 Mexican military officials accused of organized crime ties . The DEA said that in November 2001, Espinosa, Avila and others \"allegedly arranged the shipment of cocaine from Colombia to the United States by ship.\" The ship, loaded with 9,291 kilograms of cocaine, was boarded by U.S. agents near Manzanillo, on Mexico's Pacific coast. U.S. authorities extradited Espinosa from Mexico in 2008. A judge sentenced him to six years in prison after he pleaded guilty to a cocaine distribution conspiracy charge in 2009. A court document signed as part of the plea agreement said that he and Avila had taken part in a deal to distribute 100 kilograms of cocaine in Chicago. In the United States, Avila faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if she is convicted of charges of conspiracy to import and sell cocaine, according to a 2004 indictment filed in U.S. district court. In a 2009 interview with Anderson Cooper that aired on \"60 Minutes\" and CNN, Avila denied the charges against her, and blamed Mexico's government for allowing drug trafficking to flourish. \"In Mexico there's a lot of corruption, A lot. Large shipments of drugs can come into the Mexican ports or airports without the authorities knowing about it. It's obvious and logical. The government has to be involved in everything that is corrupt,\" she said.\n### Response: ", "target": "The so-called \"Queen of the Pacific\" faces cocaine trafficking charges .\nAuthorities have said she was a key link between Mexican and Colombian cartels .\nHer life is the subject of a ballad and a best-selling book .\nIn 2011, accusations surfaced that she received a Botox treatment in prison .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction :Can you give me the gist of this text?The critical Java vulnerability that is currently under attack was made possible by an incomplete patch Oracle developers issued last year to fix an earlier security bug, a researcher said. The revelation, made Friday by Adam Gowdiak of Poland-based Security Explorations, is the latest black eye for Oracle's Java software framework which is installed on more than 1 billion PCs, smartphones, and other devices. Miscreants use these exploits to turn compromised websites into platforms for silently installing keyloggers and other types of malicious software on the computers of unsuspecting visitors. Last year saw a steady stream of attacks that exploited Java vulnerabilities, allowing miscreants to surreptitiously install keyloggers and other malicious software when unwitting people browsed compromised websites. The abuse has already continued into 2013, when on Thursday researchers reported yet another critical bug that is being \"massively exploited in the wild\". According to Gowdiak, the latest vulnerability is a holdover from a bug (referred to here as Issue 32) that Security Explorations researchers reported to Oracle in late August. Oracle released a patch for the issue in October but it was incomplete, he said in an e-mail to Ars that was later published to the Bugtraq mailing list. \"Bugs are like mushrooms, in many cases they can be found in a close proximity to those already spotted,\" Gowdiak wrote. \"It looks like Oracle either stopped the picking too early or they are still deep in the woods.\" Oracle representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. This post will be updated if a reply comes later. People who don't use Java much should once again consider unplugging Java from their browser, while those who don't use it at all may want to uninstall it altogether. The release notes for Java 7 Update 10\u2014the most recent version\u2014say users can disable the program from the browser by accessing the Java Control Panel. KrebsOnSecurity has instructions here for other ways to do this. Exploits of the latest Java vulnerability, which were first observed more than a month ago, are the combination of two bugs. The first involves the Class.forName() method and allows the loading of arbitrary (restricted) classes. The second bug relies on the invokeWithArguments method call and was also a problem with Issue 32 that Oracle purportedly patched in October. \"However, it turns out that the fix was not complete as one can still abuse invokeWithArguments method to setup calls to invokeExact method with a trusted system class as a target method caller,\" Gowdiak wrote. \"This time the call is however done to methods of new Reflection API (from java.lang.invoke.* package), of which many rely on security checks conducted against the caller of the target method.\" Developers of the Metasploit framework for hackers and penetration testers have released a module that should exploit the vulnerability on machines running Windows, Apple OS X, and Linux regardless of the browser they're using.

There has been no sign of her since August 19, 2007. Liza Murphy has been missing from her home in Emerson, New Jersey, since August 19, 2007. Murphy's friends and family reported her missing the next day. \"In my heart, I fear the worst, that my daughter is gone,\" said her mother, Sophia Stellatos. Police searched extensively for Murphy, especially around a reservoir not far from her home, but they found nothing. Cadaver dogs caught her scent near the George Washington Bridge, but the trail went cold, police told the family. Deepening the mystery, her husband, Joe Murphy, tried to take his own life a few days after his wife disappeared by walking into oncoming traffic and throwing himself in front of a fire truck, police say. He was hospitalized and recovered from his injuries, but police say he hired a lawyer and is no longer cooperating with investigators. His lawyer said Murphy, an Irish immigrant, has nothing to hide from the authorities. He said his client has no criminal record and no history of violence. Attorney Joseph Rem added that there was no physical violence in the marriage. According to her family, Liza Murphy, 42, was not the type of person to take off on her own without letting her family know.  Watch an update \u00bb . \"She would never leave her three children behind voluntarily,\" her mother insisted. \"What doesn't make sense is Liza leaving her house without her purse, cell phone, wallet, keys or cigarettes,\" she added. \"She was a heavy smoker, and if she took off after a fight for a walk to cool off, she definitely wouldn't leave without her cigarettes!\" Liza Murphy and her husband were having marital problems, her family said. Stellatos described Joe Murphy as possessive of his wife, never allowing her to go out with her friends. She said he was even jealous if she spent time with her parents. Rem pointed out that his client has not been named as a suspect or a person of interest in the case. He said police have not asked to speak to his client recently. Liza Murphy's children are 15, 13 and 10 years old now. Joe Murphy has full custody of them, and the Stellatoses have not seen their grandchildren since shortly before their daughter disappeared. Murphy and her children had spent the week before her disappearance visiting with her parents, who live about 125 miles away. They returned the Friday before Murphy's disappearance. Police say both the Murphy home and their vehicles have been processed for forensics, but they found no evidence of foul play or struggle. Liza Murphy had been suffering from depression and was on medication for fibromyalgia, a painful condition that affects the muscles and soft tissues. Police say she may have been accosted after she left home, still stewing over the argument. The police seek the public's help in this case.

Nathan Louis Campbell, 38, is charged with murder, 16 counts of assault with a deadly weapon and 17 counts of hit-and-run, said Deputy District Attorney Gary Hearnsberger. The charges include the special allegation of use of a deadly weapon, a car. Campbell, who was being held on $1.48 million bail, could face a life sentence if convicted. Campbell, wearing a blue jail jumpsuit at his arraignment, was handcuffed at the waist and wrists. When asked whether he wanted to waive his right to a speedy trial, Campbell answered, \"Yes, sir\" during the brief appearance.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?\n### Input :(Financial Times) -- Prime minister Manmohan Singh faces a growing political storm over how to measure poverty in India amid fears that new benchmarks proposed by a powerful policymaking body could see many of the country's poor lose their welfare benefits. The poverty line estimates in India, traditionally worked out by calorie intake, are highly sensitive because as many as 400m Indians live on less than $2 a day. Those below the poverty line are entitled to subsidised food and other welfare payments. But new benchmarks by the Planning Commission, submitted in an affidavit to the Supreme Court as part of new food security legislation, suggest that a person living on more than Rs32 ($0.64) a day in urban areas, like New Delhi and Mumbai, would no longer be classified as being below the poverty line. The threshold for rural areas would be Rs26 a day. By comparison, the World Bank's poverty line is $1.25 a day. India is now home to more poor people than the entire sub-Saharan Africa region. Two years ago, a government appointed commission estimated that one in three Indians live below the poverty line. The commission's estimate was higher than an earlier Planning Commission estimate of 28 per cent of the population. But Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the respected economist who is now the Planning Commission's deputy chairman, has argued that up-to-date data will show that India has made considerable progress in reducing poverty levels. The proposed new benchmarks have angered leaders across India's political spectrum. They have also opened India's two most respected government economists -- Mr Singh and Mr Ahluwalia -- up to criticism that they are out of touch with the poor in India, who are struggling with the highest inflation of any large emerging market . Yashwant Sinha, a former finance minister and Bharatiya Janata party leader, lambasted poverty threshold estimates put forward by the Planning Commission as \"laughable\". Mr Sinha derided the body's calculations as having exposed Mr Singh, who cuts an increasingly solitary figure in his cabinet after a year battling high profile scandals, as insensitive to what was \"a matter of life and death\" for many people and the cause of violence across India. \"Neither the prime minister nor the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission has any real idea of poverty. They rarely go to the villages and interact with the poor,\" Mr Sinha said. The benchmarks have also divided the Planning Commission itself. A senior member of the commission told the Financial Times that the poverty line figures should not have been included in the affidavit. He said the government had to do better on how it communicated economic policy to the country's 1.2bn people. \"I wouldn't have put these numbers in,\" he said. \"You can't [as an economic planner in India] get on your high horse of economic rationalism.\" Senior Congress party ministers have also raised objections. Jairam Ramesh, the minister for rural development and a close ally of Congress party president Sonia Gandhi, has written to Mr Ahluwalia asking him to consider alternative measurements and warning of possible confrontation.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?\n### Input :The Texas teen facing a felony terrorism charge over an alleged threat on Facebook has been released on bail after an anonymous donor posted a $500,000 bond. Justin Carter, 19, had spent five months in prison for posting, during an argument about a video game, what he said was a sarcastic comment about how he was going to \"shoot up a kindergarten.\" \"I just think it got taken out of context, and it's been blown out of proportion,\" Carter told Kate Bolduan on \"New Day,\" CNN's morning show. The brief interview marked Carter's first public comments since he was jailed in February. Carter's case has received widespread media attention and alarmed free-speech activists. His arrest came amid heightened concerns over school violence since December's mass shootings at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. In February, Carter and a friend were arguing on Facebook with someone else over the online video game \"League of Legends.\" His father told CNN that other gamer called Justin crazy and his son responded with sarcasm. According to court documents, Justin wrote, \"I'm f***ed in the head alright. I think I'ma (sic) shoot up a kindergarten and watch the blood of the innocent rain down and eat the beating heart of one of them.\" Jack Carter said his son followed the claim with \"LOL\" and \"J/K\" -- indicating that the comment wasn't serious. \"Any clear reading and full reading of the context of that statement would make it obvious that this was just a sarcastic joke,\" Chad Van Brunt, one of Carter's attorneys, told CNN on Friday. \"If we get to trial ... it's just going to be abundantly clear, if it's not already.\" Authorities said someone reported the comment -- which came about two months after the mass killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School -- leading to Carter's arrest February 21 on a felony charge of making terroristic threats. In Texas, that carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. The teen had remained in jail because Jack Carter and his wife, Jennifer, said they couldn't afford to post the bond required to free their son. The family's attorney, Don Flanary, told CNN that Justin Carter had suffered abuse while behind bars, and his parents had expressed concerns about his safety. Carter was released Thursday to his home near New Braunfels, Texas, after an unnamed donor came forward and posted the bond, Flanary said. He said the donor wishes to remain anonymous. \"For now I'm over-the-moon happy. I just want to spend all my time talking to him and looking at him,\" mother Jennifer Carter told CNN on Friday. \"There's been a lot of hugs going around and crying. We don't have to worry anymore about him being hurt (in jail) ... and for any parent that's just such a relief.\" An online petition seeking Justin Carter's release from jail had received more than 126,000 signatures. A pretrial hearing for Carter is scheduled August 12. Flanary told CNN he will be filing a motion to dismiss the charges because they violate Carter's First Amendment rights. The Comal County district attorney's office, which is prosecuting the case, has not responded to CNN's requests for comment. The case is viewed by some as a cautionary tale about the repercussions of controversial statements posted online. Asked by CNN's Bolduan what he might have done differently, Carter said, \"I certainly would have thought a lot more about what I said and how permanent my writing -- and everyone's writing -- is (on the Internet). People should be very, very careful of what they say. It's being recorded all the time, if you say it on any website, anywhere. \"And you can get in trouble for something that's not something you should get in trouble for. I just want people to be warned.\"\n### Response :", "target": "Texas teen facing a terrorism charge over an alleged threat on Facebook is free on bail .\nJustin Carter, 19, spent five months in prison for what he says was a sarcastic comment .\nHe was freed after an anonymous donor posted a $500,000 bond .\n\"I just think it got taken out of context, and it's been blown out of proportion,\" Carter says .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction: What's the text mainly about?(CNN) -- Brazilian striker Brandao has been handed a one-month jail sentence for headbutting an opposing player, with the severity of his punishment linked to the footballer's role model status, according to one of the lawyers involved in the case. The judicial punishment follows a six-month sporting ban given to Brandao, who plays for French Ligue 1 side Bastia, following the August incident when he assaulted Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Thiago Motta. \"This is an extremely severe sentence compared to the criminal record of my client,\" Brandao's lawyer Olivier Martin told CNN affiliate BFMTV after the three-judge panel's ruling, which also included a $25,000 fine. \"It's all the more severe because of the motivation that was raised by the President of the Court to justify the sentence,\" added Martin. \"He referred to the violence in football stadiums.\" Brandao headbutted the Italy international in the tunnel of PSG' s Parc des Princes stadium following the match which the Parisian club won 2-0. The 34-year-old can be seen on CCTV waiting around before striking Motta and then running off out of shot with Brazilian-born Motta following in hot pursuit. Motta's lawyer Francois Klein said \"the court wanted to mark the occasion,\" as Ligue 1 players were considered role models to many people. \"Because these images are widely circulated; it gives the youth an absolutely regrettable idea,\" said Klein. \"It's well known that in many stadiums, suburban or elsewhere, there are similar events that may occur, and it is necessary that professional players lead by example.\" Neither of the two players involved were present at the Paris court for the trial. The court was particularly annoyed by the absence of Brandao, who was having surgery in a Saint Etienne hospital Thursday. Brandao is expected to \"benefit from a sentence adjustment,\" meaning he would serve his punishment through a community service rather than in jail. Against PSG, Brandao was playing in only his second match for the Corsica-based club after joining from Saint Etienne in the summer. He was initially suspended for four weeks following the attack which broke Motta's nose. Last season, he was banned for three matches for elbowing another PSG player, Yohan Cabaye, in the head. \"Brandao will be available to play again on Feb. 22, 2015,\" the French league's disciplinary committee said in a statement following his September punishment, meaning the striker will miss 24 league matches in total.\n### Response: ", "target": "Brazilian striker Brandao given one-month jail sentence .\nBastia forward's punishment likely to be community service .\nBrandao punished for headbutting Paris Saint-Germain's Thiago Motta .\nMotta's lawyer says severity of punishment linked to Brandao's role model status .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?London, England (CNN) -- British Airways passengers face the prospect of holiday season chaos after cabin crew voted to strike for almost two weeks over Christmas and New Year in protest over cost-cutting measures introduced by the airline. More than 12,500 BA employees, balloted by trade union Unite in November, voted by a 92.5 percent majority to walk out from December 22 for 12 days, Unite Deputy General Secretary Len McCluskey announced Monday. In a statement to customers on its Web site, BA said it was reworking its flight schedules for the strike period and would announce them as quickly as possible. It said it would inform affected customers by e-mail or text message. The strike ballot came after the airline introduced cost-cutting measures including a two-year pay freeze and reducing the numbers of cabin crew members on long-haul flights. BA says the changes, introduced in the wake of a record pre-tax loss of more than $485 million for the six months from April to September, will save the airline $665 million. McCluskey warned that the strike would inflict \"catastrophic damage\" to the airline if it went ahead and urged British Airways bosses to return to the negotiating table. He said union members had been pushed into a corner by BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh. \"We've been saying to Mr. Walsh this seems crazy at a time when British Airways is suffering badly through an economic downturn that he should force us into a dispute that would have catastrophic effects on the economy of the company,\" McCluskey told CNN following a news conference at Sandown Racecourse, southern England. \"That's why we're hoping that even at this late hour the strength of feeling of our members will get through to the company. We are available 24 hours a day to meet the company. If they are up for getting an agreement I'm confident we can get one.\" McCluskey said passengers, upset at having their holiday plans disrupted, should take their anger out on the airline. McCluskey said his members were not \"mindless militants\" but decent men and women who had been forced into a corner by British Airlines. But Walsh said strike action was \"completely unjustified\" and called on union chiefs to resume negotiations. He said the airline had agreed pay cuts with pilots and more efficient ways of working with engineers, while a third of managers had taken voluntary redundancy. BA cut 1,900 jobs over the summer through reduced overtime, increased part-time working, and voluntary redundancies. But it plans to eliminate 3,000 more jobs by March 2010, Walsh said last month. \"My admiration for the professionalism and skills of British Airways cabin crew is second to none. They are an absolutely vital part of our airline, and a great asset,\" Walsh said. \"But they have been disgracefully misled by Unite as to how our company-wide cost reduction program would affect them.\" CNN's Richard Quest said the impact of the potential strike would be devastating for BA and said the consequences would be disruption for BA passengers and higher prices for travelers booking on other airlines. \"Their planes are heaving and they are now about to face a strike,\" Quest said. \"They are going to have tens of thousands of passengers who are concerned, who are worried. I imagine anyone who is going away for Christmas is now thinking about shifting their booking if they can.\" A spokesperson for ABTA, which represents travel agencies and tour operators in the UK, said passengers booked onto BA flights should wait and see what contingency plans the airline puts in place and whether the strike goes ahead. \"Hopefully the strike could be called off and if you cancel your flight now then you may not be able to claim a refund,\" she said. Unite has called on the High Court to rule on whether BA's cutbacks have breached its member's contracts but the case is not scheduled to be heard until February 2010.\n### Response:", "target": "BA cabin crew vote overwhelming for strike action over proposed cutbacks .\nUnion plans to begin action from December 22 for 12 days .\nUnion opposes cost-cutting measures including reduced crews on long-haul flights .\nUnion boss urges BA to return to negotiating table to avoid \"catastrophic damage\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The women, Melissa Reid, 19, from Scotland and Michaella McCollum, 20, from Ireland, were arrested by Peruvian national police at Jorge Chavez International Airport in the capital on August 6. They were stopped as they tried to board an Air Europa flight from Lima to Madrid after authorities allegedly found 11.59 kilograms (25.5 pounds) of cocaine in their luggage. Their final destination was Palma de Mallorca. The cocaine was found inside pouches of oatmeal and dehydrated foods. \"I was forced to take these bags in my luggage,\" said Reid, in video footage of the police interrogation. McCollum's family issued a statement Tuesday saying that they stand behind their daughter and are making arrangements to go to Peru. \"Michaella's family are obviously shocked and distressed by the recent events but are confident that Michaella will be exonerated,\" family attorney Peter Madden said. According to police, the pair were contacted by a Colombian named \"Enrique\" in Palma de Mallorca through a tourism company that flew them to Lima and then to Machu Picchu. But the tourism was cover for a plan to smuggle the drugs, police told CNN. Archbishop of Lima Sean Walsh, an Irish-American bishop who's been in Peru for the past seven years, told CNN he was able to meet briefly with the young women in the police cell where they are being held. He said the two are in good condition, are eating well, have clean clothing and are receiving good care. Walsh dismissed media reports suggesting they are not being treated well and that one of the women is on a hunger strike. Reid and McCollum are expected to appear before a judge Wednesday, he said. The Ministry of Justice normally has an official translator present, said Walsh, who often visits foreigners held in jail in Lima. While he was visiting the women, a prosecutor entered and told them that they needed to cooperate as fully as possible, Walsh said. He expects to see the pair again Wednesday evening, he added. They do not yet have an attorney to represent them that he knows of, Walsh said. The court system in Peru usually provides a public defender but they may try to hire private defense lawyers, he added. Walsh said he had also been in touch with the parents of both young women, who are feeling fear and shame over their arrest. He said McCollum's parents told him she had been calling them every day from Ibiza, the Spanish island on which, according to UK media reports, the two girls had been spending the summer. But the calls home stopped, he said, and the parents then started a social media campaign to find her. A UK Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We can confirm the arrest of a British national in Peru on 7 August. We are providing consular assistance.\" A spokeswoman for Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs said it was providing consular assistance to Connolly and her family through the Irish Embassy in Mexico, and was also working with the British Embassy in Lima.

Some left photos or notes; others simply sat quietly at their loved ones' headstones. \"To lose a child changes your entire life,\" Higgins said. \"It's my son's wish that keeps me going.\" That wish was for a memorial to those killed in ongoing conflicts, something the Marine mentioned to his mother during one of their final phone conversations. \"It will be the National Fallen Heroes Memorial, and it will be from first killed after Vietnam until the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom,\" Higgins said. \"We're going to remember them all.\" The memorial is privately funded and will be located on Route 15, just north of Frederick, Maryland.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the main idea?London, England (CNN) -- A letter written by Adolf Hitler in 1931 hoping for a \"truly cordial relationship\" between Britain and Germany goes on sale Tuesday and is estimated to fetch up to \u00a312,000 at auction. The one-page letter was addressed to Sefton Delmer, a British journalist, in which Hitler expressed hopes of a new friendship between the two countries to replace the \"unhappy war-psychosis\" that existed after the First World War: . Hitler wrote the letter 16 months before he became chancellor and seized power in 1933. In the letter he said: \"I hope... that out of this crisis a new readiness will grow up in Britain to submit the past twelve years to a reappraisal. I should be happy, if as a result of this the unhappy war-psychosis could be overcome on such a scale as to permit the realization of the truly cordial relationship between the British and the German peoples so eagerly desired by myself and my movement. \"For I believe that the crisis now breaking in on us can only be solved by the closest political collaboration of those nations who see in the re-establishment of a natural European balance of power the first precondition to dealing with those great world problems under which Britain too suffers today.\" Andrew Roberts, the British military and political historian, said the letter was a classic example of Hitler trying to lull Western democracies into a state of appeasement. Roberts said Hitler was saying there were underlying interests between Britain and Germany and that he wrote many such letters. \"He refers to 12 years which would make it 1919, the year the Versailles Treaty was signed... appeasement was his central message until the outbreak of war. Sefton Delmer would not have been taken in by any of this,\" said Roberts. Auctioneers at Bonhams in London said the letter has remained in Delmer's family until now but they could not release the name of the person selling it. Delmer was the Berlin correspondent of the Daily Express at the time when Hitler wrote the letter. He was born in Berlin and spent the first 15 years of his life there before his family were expatriated to the UK. He is reported to be the first British journalist to interview Hitler, who he later described as a rather ordinary looking man with hair that had been arranged too carefully.\n### Response:", "target": "Hitler wrote the letter 16 months before he became chancellor and seized power in 1933 .\nAndrew Roberts: \"Appeasement was his central message until the outbreak of war.\"\nDelmer was the Berlin correspondent of the Daily Express .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Read the following passage and summarize it.(CNN)The videos taken by citizens of Paris during Wednesday's attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo indicate significant training on the part of terrorists. Here are some things any military professional would observe: . \u2022 The uniform: All the attackers are uniform in appearance. All have vests capable of holding multiple magazines of ammunition for their weapons, and perhaps grenades.  Additionally, they are all wearing what appear to be heavy coats. That could indicate either body armor or possibly suicide vests underneath to be detonated if captured.  Some experts are suggesting \"they came to kill, not to die,\" but those of us with experience in these kinds of encounters might suggest they came to kill until they are trapped -- then they will willingly die if they can kill more by detonating a suicide vest as a last resort. \u2022 Use of weapons: The terrorists were wielding AK-47s, according to police spokesman Xavier Castaing, but at least one of them also appeared to have a military 3-point sling attached to the weapon (the white strap going over the shoulder).  These slings are used in close-in attacks.  The driver does not appear to have this strap, which allows for freedom in the car. The attackers appear to be good marksmen, as evidenced by the tight shot of a group of bullets that riddled the windshield of a French police car, shown in several photographs at the scene. Additionally, the attackers have their weapons on semi-automatic (single shot) versus full automatic. Many terrorists use what U.S. soldiers derisively call the \"pray and spray\" method.  That is, they point their weapons on full automatic, scream a religious slogan and let loose with a stream of bullets -- most of which don't hit the targets.  These terrorists appear well-trained, with aimed fire, single shots and controlled targeting. \u2022 Fire and maneuver: These terrorists appear to have been trained in movement techniques: They use cover (parked automobiles, or an open car door) and aim fire while their terrorist \"buddy\" maneuvers to a new firing location.  At that point, the moving terrorist aims and fires, while the previously covering terrorist moves to join him. \u2022 Reconnaissance: The attack occurred at noon in busy Paris, yet there was no traffic on the side streets where the citizens' filming took place. Additionally, initial reports indicate that an editors' meeting was occurring at that time, with all the subjects in one room. That indicates there was intelligence, route planning and then individual requirements for the members of the terrorist team. \u2022 Speed: They moved fast, knew where they are going, did their job, and then they were gone. Again, that's indicative of rehearsals but also single-mindedness of mission. \u2022 Selection of target: This was a follow-on attack. The offices of Charlie Hebdo had been previously firebombed, but that attack was not successful. Much like the initial World Trade Center bombing in 1993 that was followed by the 2001 attack, these terrorists were again going after the same target. Usually, terrorists film their attacks for future information operations and social media use.  They may have had terrorist videographers in specific locations for that purpose during this attack as well. Those videos may appear in the future, but until then French citizens posting YouTube videos contribute to the terrorists' information campaign. In the next few hours and days, other countries of Europe -- especially Germany and Italy -- will be interested in sharing information from this attack, as they face similar threats from Muslim extremists. France, the European Union and Interpol will share information, and given the ability of the terrorists to move freely through Europe, this passing of information will be critical. The passport-free Schengen Area allows for movement through 26 countries in Europe on the motorways and autobahns, so while initially this is an attack on France, these terrorists are a threat to all of Europe.\n### Response :", "target": "Videos show speed, preparation by terrorists in Paris attack, Mark Hertling says .\nAttack's timing indicates intelligence and route planning on part of terror team, Hertling says .\nHertling calls it a follow-on attack after earlier firebombing on Charlie Hebdo failed .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.\n### Input:(CNN) -- Many people thought that the massacre of 20 young school children and six educators by a gunman wielding an assault weapon would change the terms of the debate over firearms regulation. It appears that they were wrong. Not only does it now seem that Congress will not reinstate the assault weapons ban, but it also appears unlikely to place restrictions on the size of magazines so as to reduce the number of bullets that can be fired before reloading is required. For opponents of these measures, such a result would be vindication of what they argue is the absolute right to bear arms set forth in the Second Amendment. Such arguments ignore the fact that in its 2008 decision recognizing that the Second Amendment created a personal right to bear arms unrelated to serving in a militia, the Supreme Court also recognized the permissibility of \"reasonable\" restrictions on that right, including potentially prohibiting carrying \"dangerous and unusual weapons.\" For others, however, a legislative outcome that includes neither an assault weapons ban nor restrictions on magazines is just more of the same -- a powerful lobby using aggressive tactics to persuade Congress to ignore majority support for these measures. I must say, however, that if this turns out to be the result, I will be sad but hardly shocked. Gun bill filibuster? In 1978, while serving as the Treasury official overseeing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, we proposed regulations that would have created a centralized database of firearms transactions (which would not have included the names of individual retail purchasers). The purpose of such a database was to allow speedier tracing of firearms used in crimes and to allow the ATF to analyze the flow of firearms to particular dealers, which would suggest which dealers were diverting firearms to the illegal market. Even though these proposals would have had no effect on anyone's right to own any firearm, the NRA mounted a campaign against them, and Congress voted to prohibit any such database from ever being established, a prohibition that remains in effect today. During the debate over these regulations, I heard from some members of Congress that while the proposals made sense, politics precluded them from expressing support. Thirty years later, it seems little has changed. So given this state of play, what should be the focus of those who believe that added regulations of firearms would help save lives? Despite emotions, little happens legislatively after mass shootings . Obviously, a first step is to continue to make the case for an assault weapons ban and limitations on the size of magazines. The issue, after all, should be not whether such steps avoid all mass shootings, but whether they could save some lives. Would it not have been worth it even if some of those murdered in Newtown could have survived because the shooter did not have an assault weapon? But there are other things that can and should be done: . 1. We need to work to ensure that Congress at least finally creates a system of universal background checks for all firearms purchasers. Many people believe such a system exists today; it does not. Along with such a system, we need to improve the databases used in connection with such checks. 2. Focus should be placed on what is happening in particular states. For example, states such as New York and Colorado have made meaningful changes in gun laws in response to the spate of recent mass shootings, and other states have meaningful restrictions on firearms possession. It is true, however, that attitudes toward guns are different in different regions of the country. If certain states choose to have fewer firearms regulations, those choices should not be allowed to interfere with the policy decisions of those states that decide that a safer society requires more firearms regulations and fewer guns on the streets. Yet this is precisely what happens now where guns sold in low- or no-regulation states end up on the streets of those cities and states with far stricter regulation. Thus, we need -- as is being proposed -- to toughen the laws on \"straw man\" purchases and firearms trafficking and to make it a federal crime to transport a gun into a state where possession of that gun would be illegal. 3. Congressionally imposed restrictions placed on ATF's ability to enforce existing laws should be removed. This includes ending the ban on the creation of a centralized firearms transaction database, but also ending restrictions like the ban on ATF's ability to require gun dealers to conduct annual inventories to determine whether firearms have been lost or stolen. (Unfortunately we are instead seeing moves to make these kinds of restrictions permanent.) Opponents of new firearms regulations often argue that existing laws should be enforced before we pass new ones. Unfortunately, Congress is too often pressed to impose rules that make such enforcement less effective. Opinion: More gun mayhem, and yet we wait for action . In the end, a sensible approach to gun violence would, among other non-law enforcement steps, include prohibitions directed at assault-type weapons, more regulation of handguns, less regulation of traditional long guns and working to make sure that federal, state and local law enforcement have the tools to enforce the laws relating to firearms. Unfortunately, logic does not always operate when the topic is guns. What are your views on gun control? Share your thoughts .

But abortion is illegal without exceptions in El Salvador, and on Wednesday, the country's Supreme Court denied her petition. Atttorneys for the 22-year-old woman, known only as \"Beatriz,\" argued that the mother's life was at risk if the pregnancy was not terminated. Ill woman at center of abortion debate in El Salvador . In a 3-1 vote, the justices ruled the risk to Beatriz's life was not imminent but a possibility in the future. \"This court finds that the rights of the mother cannot be prioritized over those of the (fetus) nor vice versa,\" the ruling said. The ruling found that doctors must continue to monitor the woman and make the best medical decisions that take into account the risks to her life, and to the unborn baby, too. Beatriz is suffering from lupus and kidney problems, and her unborn child developed without parts of the brain or skull. She asked for an abortion so that doctors could focus on saving her life, but doctors were hesitant to carry out the procedure without assurances that they wouldn't be prosecuted, her attorneys said. Doctors said they expect the baby to survive only for hours after birth. She argued that an abortion could save her life and allow her to care for her other child, who is a year old. Anti-abortion groups countered that abortion-rights advocates were using Beatriz as an opening to push for changes to abortion laws. \"The constitution makes it clear that life exists from the moment of conception, and anything that tries to end a life is murder,\" lawmaker Rodolfo Parker said after the ruling. Women's rights groups who have held rallies in support of Beatriz said they were disappointed by the ruling and criticized the high court for taking weeks to reach a decision. \"There has to be a prudent period (to make a decision) that doesn't take practically a month and a half like we waited to have a serious analysis,\" said Ima Guirola of the rights group CEMUJER.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the text mainly about?The news that Yahoo knowingly chose a pregnant woman as its new CEO has rightly been heralded by working women and their allies as another hole in the glass ceiling. Marissa Mayer, until now a top executive at Google, reports that when she told Yahoo's board of directors that she and her husband are expecting their first child in October, no one expressed any second thoughts about hiring her. The lack of reaction \"showed their evolved thinking,\" she said. But Mayer's next sentence immediately squashed any illusions that her presence at Yahoo foreshadows any change in corporate America's 24/7 work culture. \"My maternity leave,\" she told reporters, \"will be a few weeks long, and I'll work throughout it.\" Mayer's assurance that having a child will require so little adjustment in her work schedule has led many women to worry that she is naive about the physical and emotional price she will pay for taking so little time to recuperate and bond with her new baby. Others express concern that her child will suffer for her decision. Tech: 11 fun facts about Mayer . These worries are mostly groundless. The real problem with Mayer's pledge to take only a few weeks off and work right through it has little to do with her own welfare or her child's. It is the message this sends to her employees about the expected work culture at Yahoo. Mayer will probably do just fine returning to work so early. Top executives have much more flexibility than the lower-level employees they rely on to be at the office bright and early, set things up for the day, reschedule appointments when necessary, run errands and deliver needed papers if they are working off-site. They can also afford to hire live-in nannies so that they never need to scramble to cover gaps or breakdowns in child care coverage. Mayer's husband, a tech investor, has similar flexibility. Mayer's son is also likely to turn out fine, assuming that she and her husband are even moderately competent parents. On average, while very short maternity leaves do increase the risk of insecure attachment between mother and child, most mothers bond successfully, even with short leaves. Psychologists Philip and Carolyn Cowan, authors of \"When Partners Become Parents\" and leading experts in what makes for effective child outcomes, note that  kids of working mothers do well when women are happy with their jobs, have good child care arrangements, and fathers actively participate in making these work-family choices. Tech: Six life lessons from Yahoo CEO . In fact, a major predictor of whether a woman will be warm and responsive to her child,  avoiding the bouts of depression that are one of the most serious threats to effective parenting, is whether she is happy about the work choices she makes. A woman with Mayer's work ethic would probably be a less effective parent if she felt compelled to stay home when she wanted to work. But Mayer's insistence that she will get back to work so quickly sets a bad precedent for Yahoo's lower-level employees, mothers and fathers, who do not have the job flexibility and cannot afford the extensive social support and backup systems that Mayer and her husband will be able to construct. Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families and Work Institute, argues that the personal work-life choices of top leaders in a workplace are as important as their formal work-life programs and policies in shaping expectations about what is and is not acceptable. Leaders who take little time off for family create a work culture that inhibits lower-level employees from asking for any work-family rearrangements they may need. Tech: The internet just wants Mayer to fix Flickr . It's great that corporate leaders no longer assume a high-powered female employee will lose her brain, drive and work commitment when she gets pregnant. And I admire Mayer for feeling free to set a high priority upon her work commitments without succumbing to the guilt that weighs down so many working moms. But it might be better for the rest of us working parents, who don't have the same resources and support systems, if she would take a longer leave and maintain a dignified silence about just how many work hours she puts in during it.

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the central ideas presented?(CNN) -- Over the past few weeks, politicians who have taken a hard-line stance against insurance coverage for contraception are offering a new alternative: make birth control available over the counter. At first glance, this appears to be a welcome shift, a reflection of the growing support for making birth control available to more women. It's not. When health insurance doesn't cover birth control and women have to pay out of pocket at the drugstore, it won't expand access to birth control but shrink it. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, more than 48 million women in the U.S. are eligible for preventive care, including birth control, with no co-pay. We're not just talking about the pill; we are talking about the full range of contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration. That's 48 million women who are able to go to the pharmacy or a doctor's office and get birth control with no out-of-pocket costs. In the first full year of the birth control benefit, American women saved $483 million more (PDF). So when politicians who have otherwise embraced policies that would drag women back to the 1950s suggest making birth control available over the counter instead of covering it in insurance plans, they're not experiencing a change of heart. They're suggesting something that would take us back to the days when women had to pay out-of-pocket for their prescriptions, making birth control harder to get for many women, not least women who use birth control methods that simply cannot be stocked on store shelves, like IUDs, one of the most effective (and expensive) forms of long-acting birth control. Offering over-the-counter birth control instead of insurance coverage for birth control amounts to a $483 million tax on women. Let's get one thing clear: More access to birth control is a good thing. That's why Planned Parenthood was founded nearly 100 years ago -- and it's why a full range of women's preventive care, including birth control, is now covered under the Affordable Care Act. Planned Parenthood, the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology agree with virtually every other mainstream health care provider and expert in this country: Birth control should be more available. Planned Parenthood has been fighting to expand access to birth control for nearly 100 years. We support making it available over the counter, in addition to requiring insurance plans to cover it -- but not instead of requiring no co-pay coverage. Women deserve both/and, not either/or. When America's leading doctors and scientists sat down last year to identify the top 10 public health achievements of the 20th century, here's what made the list: reducing heart disease, fluoride in drinking water, identifying the risks of tobacco, vaccines for a host of epidemics -- and birth control. That's because for women, the ability to decide whether and when to have children has changed everything. Thanks to birth control, more women are able to get an education, finish school and pursue careers. Women are now making more money (though we still have a ways to go on that front) and are represented in higher numbers in the work force. In the decades since birth control became widely available, child mortality declined and health outcomes improved for women, infants and children. For women, birth control isn't a controversial topic or a political bargaining chip; it's basic health care, and it's only a \"social issue\" if you've never had to pay for it. That's why insurance coverage for birth control is so revolutionary -- and necessary. Let's get one thing clear: More access to birth control is a good thing. Back when Congress was figuring out what should and shouldn't be included as part of health reform, the nonpartisan Institute of Medicine was asked to develop recommendations for women's health benefits that absolutely had to be in. The Institute recommended that insurance cover eight critical women's health services, including breastfeeding counseling and supplies, HIV screening, domestic violence services -- and birth control. Sensing a theme? The bottom line: Political proposals to make birth control available over the counter have less to do with access and more to do with the price tag, which they want women to cover out of pocket. We don't have time or energy to waste on political games, not when roughly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended and too many women still struggle to get the health care they need. At Planned Parenthood, we are eager to work with anyone who has an idea that would make birth control more readily available to women. So to these politicians: Come see us when you're really ready to talk, and let's see if we can come up with the next great advance in women's health.\n### Response : ", "target": "Cecile Richards: Politicians' push for over-the-counter birth control is not good news .\nHardliners against coverage for contraception want women to pay out of pocket, she says .\nShe says it would make birth control less available; things like IUDs couldn't be over counter .\nRichards: Proposal, aimed at thwarting Obamacare, amounts to $483 million tax on women .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.(Rolling Stone) -- After years of near-silence, Eddie Murphy gives a rare extensive print interview in the new issue of Rolling Stone, on stands and available through Rolling Stone All Access on October 28th. In the Q&A, Murphy opens up to senior writer Brian Hiatt about the ups and downs of his long career, his possible return to stand-up, his Oscar hosting plans and much more. Murphy, who co-stars in the upcoming \"Tower Heist,\" is baffled by his reputation as a near-recluse: \"I leave my house all the time,\" he says. \"But I'm not at all the Hollywood parties. I'm grown, and where else am I supposed to be? I'm supposed to be home . . . If I were out in the clubs every night, they'd be saying, 'That's a shame, look at him, 50 years old, he's still out at these clubs.' Recluses are nasty, with long nails, don't wash their a**. . . . I'm too vain to be a recluse. But homebody, absolutely. I'm 50 years old, beautiful house, I'm supposed to be home, chilling.\" Murphy says that his days of making family movies may be over. \"I don't have any interest in that right now,\" he says. \"There's really no blueprint, but I'm trying to do some edgy stuff. And I only want to do what I really want to do, otherwise I'm content to sit here and play my guitar all day. I always tell people now that I'm a semiretired gentleman of leisure, and occasionally I'll go do some work to break the boredom up.\" Murphy has decided not to make \"Beverly Hills Cop IV.\" \"They're not doing it,\" he says. \"What I'm trying to do now is produce a TV show starring Axel Foley's son, and Axel is the chief of police now in Detroit. I'd do the pilot, show up here and there. None of the movie scripts were right; it was trying to force the premise. If you have to force something, you shouldn't be doing it. It was always a rehash of the old thing. It was always wrong.\" Unlike other \"Saturday Night Live\" alumni, Murphy has refused to participate in retrospectives and hasn't been on the show in years -- but he's gotten over his grudge. \"They were s***** to me on 'Saturday Night Live' a couple of times after I'd left the show,\" he says. \"They said some s***** things. There was that David Spade sketch [when Spade showed a picture of Murphy around the time of \"Vampire In Brooklyn\" and said, 'Look, children, a falling star']. I made a stink about it, it became part of the folklore. What really irritated me about it at the time was that it was a career shot.. I felt s***** about it for years, but now, I don't have none of that.\" Murphy hasn't performed stand-up since the late 1980s, but recently, he's given some thought to trying again. \"If I ever get back onstage, I'm going to have a really great show for you all,\" he says. \"An hour and a half of stand-up and about 40 minutes of my s***** band . . . But I haven't done it since I was 27, so why f*** with it? But that's just weighing both sides. It comes up too much for me to not do it again. It's like, when it hits me, I'll do it, eventually.\" Murphy addresses reports that he stormed out of the Oscars after losing the best supporting actor award to Alan Arkin. \"Alan Arkin's performance in 'Little Miss Sunshine' is Oscar-worthy, it's a great performance. That's just the way the s*** went. He's been gigging for years and years, the guy's in his seventies. I totally understood and was totally cool. I wasn't like, 'What the f***?' Afterward, people were like, 'He's upset,' and I'm like, 'I wasn't upset!' What happened was after I lost, I'm just chilling, and I was sitting next to Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9's pops, and he leans over and grabs me and is like, [solemn voice] 'There will be other times.' And then you feel Spielberg on your shoulder going, 'It's all right, man.' Then Clint Eastwood walks by: 'Hey, guy . . . ' So I was like, 'It's not going to be this night!' [Mimes getting up] I didn't have sour grapes at all. That's another reason I wanted to host the show -- to show them that I'm down with it.\" See the full article at RollingStone.com.

Too close to the Elkhorn River, the folklore went. Instead, Pilger got two. At the same time. The rare twin tornadoes that spun through on Monday night wiped out the town's business district, obliterated its fire station and ground 40 or 50 homes into rubble, Stanton County Sheriff Mike Unger said. As much as three-fourths of the town of 350 is gone, Unger said. Two people died during the storm -- one a 5-year-old. The second death -- a traffic accident -- was probably weather-related, Unger said. Faith Regional Health Services in Norfolk said 16 people were critically injured in the storms. In southern Wisconsin, a line of thunderstorms that spawned twisters rolled through late Monday and early Tuesday. The town of Madison was hit hard. Mayor Paul Soglin said about 25 homes were damaged by the storm, which caused about $10 million in damages, reported CNN affiliate WKOW. The National Weather Service said it appeared a tornado touched down and lifted several times in the Mineral Point and Verona areas. At least 19 homes in Verona, near Madison, were damaged so badly they were uninhabitable,  WKOW reported. The weather service said two tornadoes touched down in Plateville. No deaths were reported. In Nebraska, severe weather also caused damage in the towns of Wisner, Stanton and Pender.

Back in Pilger, storm chasers captured dramatic video of the twin tornadoes tearing through the countryside. At one point, the twisters straddled a state highway. \"It was terribly wide,\" Marianne Pesotta told CNN affiliate KETV-TV. \"I drove east (to escape). I could see how bad it was. I had to get out of there.\" Hauf and other employees of the Farmers Co-op in Pilger rode out the storm in the convenience store's cooler. \"It seemed like forever, but I guess it was only a couple minutes, and it was coming down on top of us,\" Hauf told CNN's \"New Day. \"But the coolers held together wonderfully.\" When she emerged, the first thing she noticed was the condition of the stock in the store where she'd worked for 20 years. \"I guess the first thing I saw was a ... cupcake box and a 24-pack of Bud Light,\" she said.

Suarez was banned for eight games and fined $63,000 on Tuesday, pending an appeal, for comments made to Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a match in October. His club issued a lengthy statement on his behalf after the ruling, as did his teammates before Wednesday's match against Wigan, and his lawyer held a press conference in Uruguay. Manager Kenny Dalglish backed the 24-year-old on Twitter, and also wore a t-shirt depicting the Uruguay international as he continued the defense in his pre-game interview. \"Clubs will defend their players, they are their assets -- they will defend their players to the hilt,\" said Paul Mortimer, a former England under-21 international who played for Charlton and Aston Villa but now works with the Show Racism The Red Card campaign. Footballers are TV stars, and should act like it . \"The most important thing now, after the punishment, is education. He has highlighted when talking about the cultural differences that he needs some education, he needs to be able to understand that when you come to another country you have to respect the laws and the rules. \"When I go abroad and my children come with me, you educate them on what is the norm in that environment. It's folly to say that he didn't know that -- he's an international footballer, he played at the World Cup in South Africa. You can't tell me that he didn't understand what was required in this country.\" Suarez reportedly called Senegal-born France international Evra \"negrito\" -- a Spanish term meaning \"black\" which can be endearing when used with friends, but otherwise is considered offensive. British journalist Matthew Syed said Suarez, who played for Dutch club Ajax from 2007 to the start of this year, had no excuse for pleading ignorance about the potential offense such a word could have in the UK. \"I find this defense breathtakingly implausible from Suarez. He's lived in Europe for four years -- the idea that he didn't know that this particular terminology would be deeply offensive to someone like Patrice Evra is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion,\" Syed told CNN. \"I don't think it's an adequate defense anywhere in a multicultural society, in a cosmopolitan environment like football, to say that 'This sort of racist terminology is okay where I come from, so you have to put up with it.' \"You have to obey the law and conventions of the place you are living in.\" England soccer captain Terry charged with racism . FIFA president Sepp Blatter caused anger when he told CNN last month that there is no problem with on-pitch racism in football, but Mortimer insists that is not the case. \"I think there is an issue, this proves there is an issue,\" the 43-year-old told CNN. \"There are more players that have suffered from racist abuse but never really spoken out about it. \"I myself suffered from it when I was playing. But you find it's difficult to speak out about it, because the highlight is then put on the victim. \"One question I was always asked was, 'Are you really sure?' Am I really sure that someone is racially abusing me? I think I am. What is black and white becomes gray, because you get questioned. \"Throughout this situation the most important thing is, 'What was said? Was it said?' If it was then it is something we have to deal with -- investigate, and punish if punishment is necessary.\" Liverpool's Suarez fined, suspended over racist remarks . Syed, a former table tennis international who now writes for The Times, said racism in English football is not as much of a problem as it once was. \"In the 1970s and '80s, football was a place where far-right political groups would stalk the terraces for people to sign up for their hateful ideology,\" he said. \"Black players were booed, monkey chants were issued towards them, banana skins were thrown on the pitch. It's a lot better now than it was then, no question about that. \"I'm rather encouraged by the fact that a lot of top players have come out and instead of condoning and being apologetic for what (Chelsea captain) John Terry and Suarez are alleged to have said, they've come out with quite a zero-tolerance approach.\" England skipper Terry is facing criminal charges over alleged racial abuse of Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand, with a possible maximum fine of \u00c2\u00a32,500. He could face further action from the English Football Association depending on the outcome of his February 1 court case. Suarez's punishment, the first of its kind in England, paled in comparison to several previous high-profile FA disciplinary rulings. Former England captain Rio Ferdinand was banned eight months in 2004 for missing a drugs test, Eric Cantona was sidelined for the same period in 1995 for karate kicking a fan, and in 1998 Paolo Di Canio was suspended 11 matches for pushing a referee. \"There's not much of a precedent, it's a bit like plucking a number out of the air,\" Syed said. \"But even if this isn't as severe as those cases, it is nevertheless a significant deterrent. Liverpool are going to miss Suarez, no doubt about that. \"It's also a partisan case. It's not just the clubs that are divided on this moral issue -- Chelsea backing Terry, and Liverpool with Suarez-- it's also the fans of both clubs. There is an issue for football, the partisanship trumps the bigger moral questions that are the most important ones.\"\n### Response : ", "target": "Liverpool officials and players rally around Luis Suarez after his punishment for racist abuse .\nBut an anti-racism campaigner says the club should be trying to educate the player instead .\nPaul Mortimer, also a former player, says Suarez needs to learn cultural understanding .\nJournalist Matthew Syed tells CNN that Uruguayan had no excuse for pleading ignorance .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The Red Bull star, seeking his fourth consecutive Formula One title, won for the seventh time in 2013. However, as he was after winning at Ferrari's home track Monza, Vettel was booed on the podium following the race. \"Fortunately we keep winning so they've got a reason to boo, but it's not nice,\" the German said. \"As long as they keep booing, we are doing a very good job so that's the way I see it. \"The parade lap was quite nice there were a lot of people cheering. Obviously I didn't give them the most exciting race, but on days like this, I really don't mind.\" Red Bull team principal Christian Horner was less happy with the reaction from some of the crowd. \"The boy drove an unbelievable race. What we have witnessed is one of the best drives I've seen him produce in terms of raw pace and what he was able to deliver,\" Horner said. \"So to see a driver, who has put in a performance like that and to not get the reception he deserves, is not sporting. \"He says it doesn't affect him, that he doesn't feel it, and he does have a broad set of shoulders. But he is a human being at the end of the day, and like anyone he has feelings. \"When you've driven your heart out and you are getting that reaction, to me it's not fair and not right.\" Vettel's closest title rival, Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, battled his way up from seventh on the starting grid to finish second but was 32 seconds adrift in the only night race on the calendar. \"We knew we didn't have the pace, that we had to invent something, and the first opportunity was at the start,\" the two-time world champion said. \"This is a fantastic podium, a second place that feels like a win. Red Bull were too fast all weekend, so we have to congratulate them for a fantastic weekend, and next we have to do better.\" Kimi Raikkonen, who will join Alonso at Ferrari next year, overcame a back problem and a starting position of 13th to take the third and final podium place for Lotus. Vettel's teammate Mark Webber had been poised to take fourth place but suffered technical problems in the closing stages and had to retire after slipping down the field. \"We were just trying to get home at that point but then on the last lap we caught fire,\" he said. The Australian was given a lift back to the pits by Alonso, for which both were told off by the stewards -- and Webber will now face a 10-place grid penalty at the next race in South Korea following his third reprimand this season. Webber was frustrated by his car's problems, which were explained by Horner. \"We could see with 12 laps to go that we began to lose water pressure. The water then effectively ran out at which point it is only a matter of time until the engine overheats, which is what happened on the last lap -- it was cruel luck.\" Mercedes' Nico Rosberg, who had briefly led after overtaking pole sitter Vettel at the start, came through to take fourth ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton -- who remained third overall. \"The start was quite hairy, I kept the inside clear, but Nico went in too deep,\" Vettel said. \"I was able to get the place back, which was crucial because we had good pace, but then we had the safety car.\" Toro Rosso's Daniel Ricciardo, who will replace Webber at Red Bull next year, inexplicably ran into a barrier on lap 25 -- meaning the field closed up again behind Vettel, but the German roared clear again once the safety car departed. The advantage his speed created meant the 26-year-old was able to go to the pits and still come back out in front. \"After that again we had the pace, and the car was incredible, which doesn't happen by accident. It was a pleasure to drive it around this crazy track,\" Vettel said. Ferrari's Felipe Massa was sixth ahead of McLaren duo Jenson Button and Sergio Perez, with Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and Force India's Adrian Sutil claiming the other points on offer.\n### Response : ", "target": "World champion Sebastian Vettel marches towards a fourth consecutive F1 title .\nGerman dominates Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix, winning for third successive year .\nRed Bull star shrugs off post-race booing he receives from spectators .\nTitle hopefuls Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen finish second and third .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?The University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia recently announced that it will no longer hire smokers. A job applicant must be tobacco-free for six months to qualify for a position there. This decision will surely prove popular. Defending the dirty habit of smoking is now left to fat cat lobbyists, highly paid lawyers with no conscience and far-right-wing crackpots. I am not in those ranks. (Full disclosure: I was a former employee of the university.) But, keeping smokers out of the hospital work force unless it protects patients makes me very nervous. Ethically, it is hard to digest. Penn is not the first health care institution to go tobacco-free in hiring. The Cleveland Clinic did so back in 2007. The Geisinger Health System in northern Pennsylvania has had such a policy complete with required nicotine testing for more than a year. Hospitals and health systems in Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, Missouri, Idaho, Virginia, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas have all stopped hiring smokers. Lots of companies outside health care are not hiring smokers either, but the big push is in hospitals and health systems. So what is wrong with not hiring those who engage in (or have engaged in) a gross, sickening, bad habit? In justifying its decision, Penn says smoking and secondhand smoke contribute to 443,000 premature deaths a year and cost $193 billion in health care and lost productivity. So, clearly they want to try and make a dent in that bill by barring tobacco users. In addition, Penn notes on its website that, \"Employees who smoke cost, on average, $3,391 more a year for health care. In addition, smoke breaks during work may be disruptive and subject patients/colleagues to the unpleasant smell of smoke on employees' scrubs and clothing.\" So the two big reasons are making a dent in a costly bad lifestyle choice and saving money for the health care system by hiring tobacco-free employees. I am not sure if I buy the smoke break disruption or the smelly clothes arguments. If they are problems, then send the smokers outside to a spot far away from where the patients come in and out, or have them wash their hands and faces, which everyone ought be doing anyway, and only give them the same breaks from work that everyone else gets. It comes down to a matter of fairness. Why can't the hospital work with people who may want to change their behavior but are having a hard time doing so? There's a little hypocrisy when as a place where you bring people back from sickness to health, your policy seems to reflect little concern for getting health care workers to become healthier. I don't doubt smokers cost us all a lot of money. It is also cheaper not to have to hire them and give them insurance or see them miss work. But the obese, the gamblers, rugby players, skiers, the sedentary, the promiscuous who don't practice safe sex, those who won't wear helmets on motorcycles and bikes, horseback riders, pool owners, all-terrain-vehicle operators, small-plane pilots, sunbathers, scuba divers, and surfers -- all of whom cost us money and incur higher than average health care costs -- are still on the job. Picking on the smokers alone is simply not fair. And what message does a no-smokers-are-welcome policy send? We don't want you in our health care system? Shouldn't doctors and nurses learn to work with those who sin and stray from the dictates of good health? As long as those who have bad habits are not compromising the quality of health care being provided on hospital ground, then let's not exclude smoking nurses, fat physical therapists, and scuba diving pharmacists from work. What is the best way to get a doctor or nurse who smokes to stop? Make sure they cannot get a job?  Oh yeah -- that will surely make them kick the habit! Why not hire them, tell them they have to get into anti-smoking programs and pay them a bonus when they stay smoke-free? Not hiring smokers at hospitals does send a message -- but it isn't one that hospitals and health systems ought to be sending.\n### Response : ", "target": "The University of Pennsylvania Health System said it will no longer hire smokers .\nArthur Caplan: Keeping smokers out of the hospital work force is ethically hard to digest .\nHe says it's there are many unhealthy habits out there.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?MIGDAL, Israel \u2014 For the Rev. Juan M. Solana, it was the spiritual equivalent of striking oil. \n  \n When he set out to develop a resort for Christian pilgrims in Galilee, he unearthed a holy site: the presumed hometown of Mary Magdalene and an ancient synagogue where experts say Jesus may well have taught. \n  \n The project, which Father Solana, a Roman Catholic priest, describes as \u201cprovidential,\u201d will be blessed by Pope Francis during his visit to the Holy Land this month. \n  \n The story starts in 2004. Father Solana, who directs the Pontifical Institute Notre Dame of Jerusalem Center, a century-old complex that provides accommodations and a serene gathering place for Christian pilgrims, thought of building a similar facility in the Galilee region of northern Israel, where the Bible says most of Jesus\u2019 ministry and miracles took place. \n  \n After a search for suitable land, four privately owned plots were acquired on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee near the small Israeli town of Migdal and the destroyed Arab village of Al-Majdal. Both were named for the ancient town of Magdala, where the name of Mary Magdalene, one of Jesus\u2019s most faithful followers, suggests she was from. ||||| DPA - Some would call it luck, others coincidence. Father Eamon Kelly calls it \"providence.\" \n  \n When his Catholic organization, the Legions of Christ, bought a piece of land on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, little did it know what it would find. \n  \n When people think of Jesus, they usually think of Bethlehem or Jerusalem, Kelly points out. But Jesus spent almost his entire life and ministry in what is now northern Israel. \n  \n \"Eighty percent of Jesus' public life was here,\" says the Irish-born priest, gesturing at the Galilee region. \n  \n He stands on what are likely ruins of the ancient town of Magdala, thought to be the home of Jesus' best-known female disciple, Mary Magdalene. The waterline of Israel's only sweet-water lake shimmers in the distance. \n  \n It took his organization several years to buy and acquire permits for four adjacent plots of land on which to build a pilgrims' hotel, an inter-faith chapel, a restaurant and a women's shelter. \n  \n But in Israel, archaeological excavations are compulsory before any construction can begin. \n  \n When archeologists and volunteers started digging, they were astonished to find a treasure: A 1st-century synagogue, one of only seven in Israel - and in the entire world. \n  \n \"This is the first synagogue ever excavated where Jesus walked and preached,\" says the father, calling it \"hugely important\" for both Jews and Christians. \n  \n Experts say it's highly likely that Jesus would have preached in the recently uncovered synagogue, believed to have first been built in the year 1 as a simple structure which was then upgraded into a more ornate one in the year 40. \n  \n Until Tiberias was built, the only town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee was Magdala. \n  \n Anyone touring the region, as Jesus did according to the New Testament, teaching and preaching in synagogues all through Galilee, would not have skipped Magdala, located on the Via Maris - the ancient trade route that ran along the Mediterranean and the western shore of the Sea of Galilee all the way from Egypt to Syria. \n  \n \"He was a clever rabbi. He knew where to set up shop,\" says Kelly. \"If you walk from Nazareth to Bethsaida to Capernaum, you're going to come out here.\" \n  \n Matthew 15:39 also mentions Jesus setting foot there, saying \"and he took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala (sometimes also translated from the Greek as Magadan).\" \n  \n In the times of Jesus, people would gather in local synagogues to meet and assemble, not just for prayer. \n  \n \"So if a strange rabbi came to town, a new rabbi, a new preacher, a new teacher, the logical place was to meet here,\" Kelly says, standing on the two-thousand-year-old stones. \n  \n A sculpted limestone block found in the center was probably used for writing or reading the Torah. Its relief depicts the oldest menorah ever found on stone. \n  \n According to archaeologists, the Magdala synagogue was destroyed in 67 or 68 CE by Romans in their first war with Jews. Until the Magdala Stone was discovered, the oldest menorah ever found was on Rome's Titus Arch of 82 CE. \n  \n In addition to the synagogue, its unique Magdala Stone and its menorah, the archaeologists also found fishing pools and Jewish ritual baths. \n  \n \"Actually what the archaeologists are saying now is we're digging up an entire 1st century city,\" says Kelly, adding that there are still 12 acres left to dig. \n  \n The site's hospice and restaurant are still under construction, but the lavish inter-faith chapel is ready. \n  \n Since the site formally opened to tourists and pilgrims in May, some 5,000 people have visited, says Mariana Bravo, of the Magdala Center. \n  \n She calls the project, based on donations, a \"cross-roads of Jewish and Christian history.\" \n  \n Given that the synagogue stems from a time that precedes many modern religious divisions, Kelly says it's an important symbol that's just as valuable today. \n  \n \"In here, we have a place that helps us to recognize what we share in common.\" |||||\n### Response : ", "target": "\u2013 Israel requires that archaeologists perform a sweep of any historically significant land where construction is planned, and they were surprised to find a 20-acre parcel of land along the western side of the Sea of Galilee may have ties to Jesus. Haaretz revisits a story that has the Rev. Juan Solana at its root. The Catholic priest set out a decade ago to purchase four plots near the Israeli town of Migdal. Solana's goal: to build a resort for Christian pilgrims there. In anticipation of that, in 2009 architects with the Israel Antiquities Authority began to dig, expecting to find nothing of note. Instead, they found the remnants of a synagogue that experts believe was originally constructed in the year 1AD. The Wall Street Journal earlier this year described it as the only known one from the period in Galilee; the Bible describes Jesus as \"teaching in [Galilee's] synagogues, preaching the good news.\" In terms of its location, Migdal was named for the ancient town of Magdala, where Mary Magdalene is believed to have hailed from, and the dig revealed the site in question \"was not just near Magdala; this was Magdala,\" as the Journal puts it. In Haaretz's telling, experts say it's probable that Jesus preached there. Dina Gorni, one of the archaeologists who worked on the dig, was a bit more cautious in a 2012 interview with the Global Mail. Gorni notes the synagogue was likely built to hold 120, though thousands lived in Magdala. \"We believe, we suggest, that this was a special community, not large, that put itself at the edge of the main Jewish village,\" said Gorni. \"They may be connected to Jesus and Mary Magdalene. We know that Jesus was not involved in the main Jewish community and preferred to live aside. Perhaps he was the leader around whom this synagogue was built.\" (A new book claims Jesus had two children.)", "origin": "multi_news.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Could you highlight the primary messages?Washington (CNN) -- Despite revelations in a congressional investigation of a subsidiary's mismanagement and questionable vetting of employees, the company formerly known as Blackwater could soon win millions of dollars in new job orders for work in Afghanistan. A subsidiary of Xe, the new name for Blackwater, is eligible to win Department of Defense work worth tens of millions of dollars to train Afghan police, according to a Pentagon official. Five companies were qualified to bid on the training and training-support contracts, including Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems, ARINC and the U.S. Training Center. U.S. Training Center is a subsidiary company owned by Xe. The Pentagon contract is to be announced next month. Xe has not been officially notified whether it will be awarded the contract, according to a company spokesman. \"We have not been awarded either and have no knowledge of the status of those contracts,\" said Xe spokesman Mark Corallo. An industry official told CNN that Xe made bids on two task orders under the training program, one for the actual training of Afghan police and one for logistics support for such training. Once awarded, the new orders would be in effect until August 2012, according to a Department of Defense statement. Since 2007, the company, then called Blackwater, has held the rights to bid against the other four companies on a pool of jobs worth as much as $15 billion. Xe still holds numerous contracts under three company names in Afghanistan for support of military and intelligence operations. Those companies are US Training Center, Greystone and Presidential Airways. The company has a troubled past both in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was banned from operating in Iraq by the government there after a shooting incident left Iraqi civilians dead and injured. That incident strained relations between the United States and Iraq. In May 2009, four contractors in Kabul were involved in a shooting incident that left two Afghan civilians dead. Two of the contractors are now facing charges in the United States. A congressional investigation found evidence that the company that hired them, a Xe subsidiary called Paravant, armed the employees despite having no permission to do so from the U.S. military. The probe also found that the company illicitly obtained the guns used in the shooting, and hundreds of others, from a stockpile of weapons meant for the use of the Afghan military and police. On Wednesday Xe officials were called before the Senate Armed Service Committee to discuss that shooting incident. The committee's chairman, Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said an Army investigation appeared to find that the contract personnel had \"violated alcohol consumption policies, were not authorized to possess weapons, violated use-of-force rules and violated movement-control policies.\" He said one of the keys to beating the Taliban in Afghanistan is the ability of U.S. forces to win support from the Afghan people, many of whom do not distinguish between U.S. contractors and the U.S. military. Xe Services Vice President Fred Roitz acknowledged the company's culpability in the 2009 incident in his opening statement to the panel. In the statement, Roitz said, \"the new Xe Services would act differently today. We simply will not send our personnel overseas without a proper authorization for a weapon (where needed) and without full compliance with all requirements.\" He said the company has \"put in place new leadership and procedures to help ensure this commitment is kept.\" On Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell defended the military's oversight of contractors. \"We've made a lot of mistakes in both Iraq and Afghanistan. And we've tried to address those mistakes in a number of ways,\" Morrell said. \"But as far as I know, people are being held to account for the mistakes and the violations that they have made.\"\n### Response: ", "target": "A subsidiary of Xe, formerly Blackwater, bid on lucrative new training contract .\nXe spokesman: No official word on whether company will be awarded contract .\nSince 2007, Xe has held rights to bid against four other firms in a $15 billion jobs pool .\nThe company has a troubled past both in Iraq and Afghanistan .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

That is the belief of Javier Hernandez, who has his eyes firmly fixed on leading his side all the way to the World Cup final. El Tri face a challenge to get out of a tricky group, which also features Cameroon and Croatia in addition to host and tournament favorite, Brazil. But Hernandez insists a nation which has never gone further than the quarterfinal stage in the past can make history this time around. \"Our mind is on the final, really,\" he told CNN. \"I think every national team has the same possibilities to win the World Cup. \"It's a very short competition and anything could happen, so our goal is to get into the final and to try to win it. \"There's no point going to a competition and just thinking: 'We're just going to play three games.' That's not the point if you want to make history.\" The striker will take heart from his side's performance at the 2010 World Cup after it progressed from a group which included France, Uruguay and host nation, South Africa. The 25-year-old scored twice in the tournament before Mexico eventually crashed out to Argentina with a 3-1 defeat in the second round. Should El Tri get that far this time around it could come up against reigning champion Spain or 2010 runner-up Netherlands in the last 16. Hernandez, though, says the big boys of the tournament hold no fear for a nation competing at their sixth straight World Cup. \"If you want to win the World Cup you need to play against the best national teams in the world. We know that if we have a very good group stage and get through, obviously the teams that we could face in the next match are going to be very difficult,\" he said. \"But there's no easy national team really -- you need to play against the best.\" Mexico's most impressive World Cup campaigns to date came in 1970 and 1986, where they made the quarterfinal stage as the tournament's hosts on both occasions. And Hernandez feels that with Brazil sharing similar conditions to his country of birth, El Tri have a better chance than many this summer. \"It's normal and it's logical that Mexico are going to find it a little bit easier because of the way the weather in Brazil,\" he added. \"It's quite similar to our country, and obviously for countries like England or other European countries which are colder or have a different type of weather, it's going to be a little more difficult for them.\" Hernandez joined Manchester United in 2010 after impressing as a youngster at local Mexican side Club Deportivo Guadalajara, where he came through the youth ranks. Despite enjoying initial success at Old Trafford, he found life tough under manager David Moyes last season and was limited to just six Premier League starts. But Hernandez, who has racked up 58 caps for Mexico since making his international debut in 2009, is determined to put a frustrating campaign behind him and get back to his best in Brazil. \"It was a very difficult year for me especially because I couldn't play and I couldn't help my team,\" he said. \"But my head now is 100% on the national team. I'm very focused and very concentrated on this World Cup. \"I want to do my best, to give my best to my teammates and to the coaching staff. Like I told you, [I want] to try and make history in this World Cup.\" Hernandez was reticent about his future at United and refused to talk about it while on international duty.

The Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate will be the last of more than four dozen such ships to put itself in harm's way. \"I am honored and humbled to have this opportunity to lead such a capable and proud group of sailors on this, the final deployment of an FFG-7 class ship, and to be the last in a great line of frigate commanding officers,\" the Kauffman's skipper, Cmdr. Michael Concannon, said in a Navy statement. The final mission for the Kauffman and its crew of 250 will be to combat drug trafficking in the U.S. Southern Command's area of responsibility, the waters of the Caribbean and off the coasts of Central and South America. \"What a fitting mission for this great ship and crew to leave as its final legacy, keeping drugs off the streets of America by stopping them at the source,\" Concannon said. After it returns from the drug trafficking mission, the Kauffman will have spent more than 28 years in the U.S. Navy. It will be decommissioned in September and possibly put up for sale to an allied navy. The first of the Perry class, the USS Oliver Hazard Perry, was launched in 1976. The Navy once had 51 of the Perry-class ships, which were up to 453 feet long and displaced as much as 4,300 tons. They enjoyed a reputation for toughness, especially after two suffered battle damage in the Persian Gulf in the late 1980s. Perhaps the most famous of the Perry-class ships was the USS Stark, which survived a deadly attack in the Persian Gulf. Thirty-seven U.S. sailors were killed on May 17, 1987, when an Iraqi jet fired two Exocet missiles into the ship while it was on patrol during the Iran-Iraq war. Less than a year later, another Perry-class frigate, the USS Samuel B. Roberts, was struck by an Iranian mine, wounding 10 of its crew, blowing a 15-foot hole in its hull and breaking the frigate's keel, damage that almost always sends a ship to the bottom. The crew of the Roberts, however, was able to save the vessel, in part by using heavy steel cables to tie cracked portions of the ship's superstructure together. The Roberts was then loaded onto another ship, the Mighty Servant 2, in Dubai and transported back to the U.S., ship on ship. Both the Stark and the Roberts were eventually fully repaired and returned to the fleet. The Stark was scrapped in 2006. The Roberts completed what is expected to be its final mission in December, with its decommissioning planned for this year. The Navy defines the primary missions of frigates as protecting shipping and anti-submarine warfare. Those duties will be taken up by the service's new littoral combat ships, 20 of which are either in the fleet, under construction or under contract. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus announced last week that the LCS will succeed the Perry-class frigates in more than mission. \"Somehow, in the 21st century, we started naming ships with strange acronyms ... instead of from our naval traditions ... so we are going to change the hull designation of the \u202a#\u200eLCS\u202c\u202c class ships to FF (frigate) ... appropriate and traditional name,\" Mabus said in a speech to the Surface Navy Association's annual symposium. Those newly designated frigates will join the world's oldest active warship in the U.S. Navy's frigate fleet, the USS Constitution. Nicknamed \"Old Ironsides,\" the Navy's historic tall-masted showpiece was commissioned in 1797 and sails from Boston Harbor to promote the service.\n### Response: ", "target": "The USS Kauffman's deployment is the last for Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates .\nPerry-class frigates have been in the U.S. Navy for almost 40 years .\nIn the 1980s, attacks nearly sank two Perry-class frigates in the Persian Gulf .\nNavy secretary says littoral combat ships will be the new frigates .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?Every five minutes a woman in India is compelled to visit a police station and report a case of cruelty -- usually one committed by her own husband or family. Every ten minutes a woman in India reports assault. Every 21 minutes one of them reports a rape. The numbers are no secret: you can do the math from the National Crime Records Bureau yourself. The total number of these assorted cases has increased in each of the last five documented years, making for a 25% jump over this period. But the numbers don't tell the complete truth. At the very least, they are frequently misrepresented. With each high profile rape in India -- sensationally reported in national and sometimes international media -- the increased number of reported crimes is cited as an example of how the incidence rape in India is on a steep upward curve. But it's a lazy correlation. In reality, we don't really know that the number of cases of rape are on the rise. All we know is that more women are reporting these crimes -- perhaps, in part, because of the spotlight on them. Either way, the number of women not reporting rapes and other crimes is a far bigger statistic -- many are undocumented, brushed under the carpet, forgotten. Gender gap . How do we explain why India has so many cases? There are likely a number of complex sociological factors but there's not much hard data. One useful indicator of the safety of Indian women is to look at how they compare globally on freedom. The World Economic Forum's new Gender Gap Index gives India a dismal scorecard -- worse than in previous years. India's women rank 134th in the world (out of 142 countries) for economic opportunities; they place 126th in the world for educational attainment; 141st in the world for health and survival. These are all basic rights that would empower them, make them less likely to be silent victims. SURVEY: Women earn much less than men generally . The only parameter India performs well on is on having a female head of state or government, where it ranks a surprising first. But the parameter itself is flawed. In 15 of the 21 years the study counts, Indira Gandhi was prime minister. History will hardly portray Gandhi's achievements as solely a triumph for Indian women; her victory and the length of her rule was also a triumph of her lineage (Gandhi's father was Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister. She shared no relation to the legendary Mahatma Gandhi, but her surname -- acquired through marriage -- didn't hurt.) A more reliable indicator of the political empowerment of India's women is how it places 111th in the world for electing female parliamentarians, and 107th in the world for voting in female ministers. Born at a disadvantage . Why the sorry state of India's women? Why are they so far behind? The sad reality is that it begins before women are even born. According to India's census, there are 940 women for every 1,000 men. In part, the difference exists because of decades of female infanticide -- the practice where families abort fetuses on discovering their sex. When girls are born, they're born with the promise of a second class life. While men enjoy a literacy rate of 82%, only 65% of Indian women can read or write. Girls in India have long been considered a burden, a cause for losing money in marriages and dowries. Data and anecdotes alike show that Indian women have been unwanted and unloved for decades. Consider how families pressure their daughters-in-law for baby boys, not girls. Consider how in rural India, many Indian parents mistreat their daughters-in-law, demanding dowries, mothers-in-law meting out the same discrimination they were once subjected to. An overwhelming 43% of crimes reported by Indian women are acts of cruelty committed by their own families. Millions of Indians -- men and women -- are complicit. The discrimination continues at a policy level: marital rape is still not considered a crime in India. Local governments and police remain poorly equipped to process crimes against women -- let alone doing so in a sensitive manner. So why are many shocked by India's abysmal statistics on crimes against women? The crimes, as always, begin at home. It should be no surprise to read about the physical crimes reported and recorded by the National Crime Records Bureau. What is surprising is how generations of Indians have stood by as their mothers, sisters, and daughters have been left behind on every indicator of quality of life; they have been denied the chance for basic equality. The WEF report makes for illuminating reading, and signposts where India needs to go to fully realize the potential of its 600 million female inhabitants.

{"source": "### Instruction: What's the main idea?\n### Input: With domestic labor costs rising, many Asian manufacturing producers are now looking to relocate their factories in other regions of the world. Could Africa replace Asia and/or China as the world's next manufacturing hub? To be sure, Africa has a number of manufacturing advantages that it has yet to realize. Besides low labor costs and abundant resources, these include duty-free and quota-free access to U.S. and EU markets for light manufactures under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act and the Cotonou Agreement. Is this enough to offset Sub-Saharan Africa's generally low labor productivity relative to that of its Asian competitors? Yes, if Africa can implement appropriate supportive policies to leverage its opportunities soon. This is the finding from a recent book by a team of World Bank economists. China dominates the global export market in light manufacturing, and its competitive edge far exceeds that of low income exporters that recently entered the global market. But steeply rising costs of land, regulatory compliance, and especially labor in China's coastal export manufacturing centers have begun to erode the latter's cost advantage, a trend likely to accelerate in the coming years. The ongoing redistribution of cost advantages in labor-intensive manufacturing presents an opportunity for Sub-Saharan Africa to start producing many light manufactures, enhance private investment and create millions of jobs. Read more: Brazil competes with China, India to invest in Africa . According to new evidence, feasible, low-cost, sharply focused policy initiatives aimed at enhancing private investment could launch the region on a path to becoming competitive in light manufacturing. These initiatives would complement progress on broader investment reforms and could foster industrialization and raise the market share of domestically produced goods in rapidly growing local markets for light manufacturers. And as local producers scale up, product will improve, and experience with technology, management and marketing will accumulate, allowing them to seize emerging export opportunities. In Sub-Saharan Africa, as in China and Vietnam, policies that encourage foreign direct investment can speed up industrial development and export expansion. Isolated successes can be multiplied, as with Ethiopia's recent foray into selling cut flowers in EU markets: a single pioneering firm opened the door to an industry that now employs 50,000 workers. Previous studies identified long lists of constraints, including corruption, red tape, inadequate utilities, poor transport and skills, inadequate access to finance, and so on. In contrast, the book proposes smaller, more specific, and sometimes newly identified constraints. Narrowing the analysis can make the reform agenda more manageable within the financial and human resource constraints of most African countries. Take the leather industry in Ethiopia. This sector employs about 8,000 workers and exported about $8 million in 2010, a fraction of similar countries in Asia such as Vietnam. Ethiopia's labor costs are lower than Asia's and the country has Africa's second largest cattle population, next to Sudan. Read more: Why Asian giants scent opportunity in Africa . Furthermore, climatic conditions mean Ethiopian animal skin is among the best in the world. Yet the most binding constraint is the shortage of quality processed leather due to poor disease control, lack of quality processing of raw hides and restrictive trade policies on processed leather. Once the problems are identified, the proposed solutions are straightforward. Treat ectoparasites (the skin disease that causes blemishes) at modest cost; allow imports and exports of raw hides and processed leather to help alleviate this constraint; and provide technical assistance. Some of these measures require changing existing policies. Others require provision of public goods such as industrial parks that could be inexpensive. Ethiopia's comparative advantage in wages, productivity, and natural resources has led the Huajian Group, a Chinese shoe maker, to build a factory in Ethiopia in three months, with two production lines starting in January 2012, exporting 20,000 pairs of shoes a month and creating some 550 jobs. So the opportunities and the preconditions are certainly there, provided African policy makers speedily seize them, as the book notes. But will Africa be the world's next manufacturing hub? Not likely. Manufacturing can be an unprecedented opportunity for Africa to industrialize and provide productive jobs to millions of Africans, especially young people who make up as much as 36% of the total working-age population; three in five of Africa's unemployed are under the age of 25. Read more: Is the West losing out to China in Africa? But the emergence of China as a powerhouse producing a variety of manufacturing goods at very cheap prices thanks to the large scale and skilful exploitation of the supply chain means that not all manufacturing jobs will be transferred from China to Africa. Due to widely varying country conditions, some African economies can take advantage of favorable wages and natural resources and benefit from taking timely measures to develop and export manufacturing goods. But large-scale production requirements also mean that some jobs will be transferred to countries such as India, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam while others will move to China's interior. In short, the invisible hand of globalization will work to ensure a redistribution of cost advantages to the benefit of the ultimate consumers around the world.\n### Response :", "target": "Low labor costs and abundant resources are some of Africa's manufacturing advantages .\nRising costs of land and labor in China have begun to erode Beijing's cost advantage .\nAfrican countries can benefit from taking timely measures to develop manufacturing goods .\nManufacturing can help Africa industrialize and create jobs for millions .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What are the central ideas presented?\n### Input :(CNN) -- The killer's parents won't talk about him. That at least is what their friend told CNN on Thursday. Their thoughts are on the other six victims of Friday's killing spree in Santa Barbara, the friend said. Elliot Rodger, who fatally stabbed three people and shot three others, himself was found dead with a gunshot wound to his head after crashing his black BMW. \"We are crying in pain for the victims and their families. It breaks our hearts on a level we didn't think possible,\" Rodger's family said in a statement read by a family friend on \"New Day.\" \"The feeling of knowing that it was our son's actions that caused the tragedy can only be described as hell on Earth.\" In a 137-page document, not to mention videos and musings on social media, 22-year-old Rodger hinted that years of rejection and jealousy led him to lash out against beautiful women and popular men. Simon Astaire, the family friend, shed some light on the kind of person that Rodger was. \"As soon as you met him, he was unbearably reserved, self-contained; he seemed to merge into the walls,\" he said. In one brief conversation, Rodger asked Astaire, a novelist, whether writing was a lonely experience. Astaire described the process as \"solitary,\" and Rodger replied with \"I know what you mean\" and turned away. \"He seemed the loneliest person in the world,\" Astaire said. As the tragedy unfolded near the University of California, Santa Barbara campus, Rodger's parents were putting the clues together that it might be their son who was involved. His mother received Rodger's manifesto, and after reading just four lines, she immediately went to YouTube to look at the videos her son had posted, Astaire said. She watched the first 20 seconds of a video titled \"Retribution\" and then called her ex-husband. Both got on the road toward Santa Barbara as the shooting was unfolding. The mother's fears were realized when she heard on the radio that a black BMW, like Rodger's, was involved. \"It was the longest journey of their lives and, I would suggest, everyone's nightmare,\" Astaire said. Among the victims were Rodger's two roommates and a visitor, Cheng Yuan Hong, 20; George Chen, 19; and Weihan \"David\" Wang, 20. Each was stabbed to death. But Rodger didn't stop there. He embarked on a shooting rampage Friday night, killing two young women: Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19, both members of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. He then went into a deli and killed UCSB junior Christopher Martinez, 20, who was getting a sandwich. Martinez's father, Richard Martinez, has publicly called for stricter gun control laws. One of the parents of a child killed in the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, wrote an open letter to Richard Martinez. The tragedy of losing a child to gun violence has made them part of the same extended family, Mark Barden wrote. \"My heart breaks for you because I know just a little about the long road ahead of you,\" he wrote, encouraging Richard Martinez to continue being an advocate for gun safety regulations. \"You will find your own path down this difficult road,\" Barden wrote. \"But know that we are here for you and all of you who have been touched by this tragedy. Together we can and will build a safer world for all our children.\" The firearms shop Shooters Paradise of Oxnard sold Rodger a gun just before the killings, manager Kevin White said. Rodger had an Isla Vista address and wasn't acting strangely when he bought the gun, White said. White, an alum of UCSB, said he spoke briefly with Rodger about Isla Vista. There was a 10-day waiting period -- no red flags arose in the background check -- and then Rodger picked up the gun, White said. The manager pointed out that a gun wasn't the only weapon used in the killings. \"It happens from time to time, but what about the guy who sold him the knives or the swords that he used, or what about the guy who sold him the car that he was driving around and hit people?\" White said. \"Do they feel bad, or did they know he was going to do something bad with it? I mean, we sell tools. They're items. It's no different than the guy that sold him the knife that he used,\" White said.

No one should face violence or discrimination for who they are or who they love.\" Samantha Power, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, characterized the law as a \"big setback for human rights for all Nigerians.\" According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), the bill passed by the Senate at the end of last year introduces a 14-year prison sentence for people who are convicted of entering into a same-sex marriage or civil union. It also reportedly makes it an offense to administer, witness or help at a same-sex marriage ceremony. NAN said the law also forbids people from running gay clubs, societies, processions or meetings in Nigeria. The punishment for such acts is 10 years in prison, it said. And the law even states that marriages or civil unions from outside the country will be void inside the country, according to NAN. Last month, Uganda's parliament passed controversial legislation that would make some gay acts punishable by life in prison. For the bill to become law, it would need the signature of that county's president, who has 30 days to make a decision. Homosexuality is illegal in most African nations based on remnants of sodomy laws introduced during the British colonial era and perpetuated by cultural beliefs. Punishments across the continent range from fines to years in prison. Worldwide, a growing number of countries now allow same-sex marriage, the majority of them in Europe. The Netherlands was the first, in 2001, and it was later joined by Belgium, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Portugal, Denmark and France. A bill to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales is also now law, though it isn't expected to come into force until later this year. French court rules mayors cannot block same-sex marriage .

Smog is related to a third of deaths in China, killing some 1.1 million people a year, and is estimated to cut lifespans by 5.5 years in China's north. In response, the Chinese government is embracing some innovative and unconventional strategies to cope -- including projects like the Liuzhou Forest City. \n  \n The Forest City is being built over 175 hectares along the banks of the Liu River in Liuzhou, a mountainous part of Guanxi Province famed for its spectacular karst formation landscapes. The ambitious project claims the city will absorb almost 10,000 tons of CO2 and 57 tons of pollutants per year and produce approximately 900 tons of oxygen by blanketing its buildings, parks and streets with almost 1 million plants and 40,000 trees from over 100 different species. \n  \n The development will be connected to Liuzhou proper by a high-speed electric rail line and use geothermal energy for its interior air conditioning and solar panels for electricity. In addition to cleaning the surrounding air, the profusion of plant life should reduce the average air temperature, create noise barriers and provide a friendlier habitat for animals, birds and insects. \n  \n Boeri hopes this model of sustainable urban architecture will be replicated throughout China. \"Vertical forest\" complexes modeled after his famous project in Milan are already underway in Nanjing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. There may also be a second \"Forest City\" in the works, reports The Guardian, this time in northern China near Shijiazhuang, one of the most polluted regions in the country. Even more than the Liuzhou project, a green city in China's north would test whether this innovative concept is a practical answer to China's pollution crisis. \n  \n CNET Magazine: Check out a sample of the stories in CNET's newsstand edition. \n  \n Logging Out: Welcome to the crossroads of online life and the afterlife. ||||| A pollution-fighting green city unlike any before is springing to life in China.

The plants will also serve \"to decrease the average air temperature, to create noise barriers and to improve the biodiversity of living species, generating the habitat for birds, insects and small animals,\" say architects at Italian firm Stefano Boeri Architetti, whose design for a \"vertical forest\" tower in Milan, Italy, is now being replicated in the Chinese cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. The Liuzhou Forest City will also use geothermal energy for heating and cooling and solar panels for electricity.

Going into the match at the Allianz Arena, Bayern had racked up eight straight wins, but a late own goal by their German international defender Jerome Boateng saw them slip to defeat. They still have a four-point lead at the top from Schalke, while Leverkusen have moved up to fifth. The visitors took the lead when Andre Schuerrle left striker Stefan Kiessling with a close range tap-in after 42 minutes. Bayern drew level with 13 minutes remaining as striker Mario Mandzukic headed home, but Leverkusen were to enjoy their first win in Munich since 1989. Boateng's attempted to head away a shot but it just flew past goalkeeper Manuel Neuer on 86 minutes. In other action, Eintracht Frankfurt missed the chance to move back above Schalke when they lost 2-1 at Stuttgart. Snow can't stop Dortmund victory . Vedad Ibisevic scored Stuttgart's winner for the second straight week. Alexander Meier had leveled for Frankfurt after Christian Gentner's sixth-minute opener for the home side . Borussia Moenchengladbach came from two down to score three late goals in a 3-2 win at Hanover. In Serie A, champions Juventus maintained their lead at the top with a controversial 1-0 win at Catania, who finished with 10 men. Chilean star Arturo Vidal put Juve ahead after 57 minutes before Catania defender Giovanni Marchese was sent off mid-way through the second half. But the real arguments came in the first half as Catania thought they had gone ahead when Argentine striker Ruben Bergessio tapped home a rebound. The referee ruled it out to the fury of the home side and their president Antonino Pulvirenti, who was sent from the bench for dissent. Inter Milan kept up their pursuit of the Old Lady with their fifth straight win, 3-2 at Bologna to stay four points behind. Andrea Ranocchia and Diego Milito put Inter 2-0 ahead before Nicolo Cherubin hit back for the home side. Esteban Cambiasso's first goal of the season sealed three points for the Nerazzurri. In La Liga, Atletico Madrid drew level on points with Barcelona at the top as man of the moment Radamel Falcao scored his 10th league goal of the season in their 3-1 win over Osasuna. Joao Miranda and Raul Garcia put Atletico 2-0 ahead in the Vincente Calderon Stadium before Roland Lamah pulled one back for Osasuna, who stay bottom of the table.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the main idea?Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Gregory Corbin was standing in San Francisco when Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter called his cell phone. Yes, the mayor. Nutter was calling Corbin to congratulate him and his students for taking first place at the Brave New Voices poetry competition July 20-23 in San Francisco. Corbin, a social studies teacher and spoken-word poet, founded Philadelphia Youth Poetry Movement to provide a positive outlet for teens in his hometown. Expressing loss, anger through 'slam' poetry . The four-day Brave New Voices festival and competition was created by Youth Speaks Inc. in 1998 after the inaugural Youth Speaks Teen Poetry Slam in San Francisco -- the first poetry competition (or slam) dedicated to youth in the nation's history. Since then, Brave New Voices has grown to include youth from across the United States and Europe, making it the largest ongoing spoken word event in the world. The Philadelphia team almost didn't make it past the first round. Dubbed the comeback kids by their mentors, they fought back from the bottom of each round, making it to the semifinals before sweeping the finals. \"That call was confirmation that what they did was bigger than them, it was a reflection on the city that needed something positive from its youth,\" said Corbin. \"The mayor has been very good to PYPM and has been very supportive.\" The mayor did more than make a phone call. During the week leading up to the competition he invited the group to City Hall, where he had a surprise for them: $5,000 from the city, $5,000 from the Lomax Family Foundation and 20 round-trip airline tickets from Southwest. When young people step up to do the right thing, adults must step up to support them, Nutter said. \"These young people, expressing themselves creatively and positively, should be an inspiration to our entire city,\" he said. \"This sends a message to all young people in Philadelphia that if you work hard, if you are positive, and if you are supported then there is nothing that you cannot achieve.\" Long hours of preparation . The close-knit group of Philadelphia teens spent weeks preparing for the competition, often practicing six days a week for sometimes up to six hours. \"It was their decision to put in this kind of work, it wasn't mandated by us,\" said Perry \"Vision\" Divirgilio, a performance coach and poetry movement mentor. \"We never had to push them because they didn't want to let anybody down.\" Philadelphia Youth Poetry Movement, \u00ad a 5-year-old nonprofit run entirely by volunteers, helps Philadelphia youth discover the power of their voices through spoken word and literary expression. The students spend their Saturdays throughout the year attending free writing workshops. There are monthly \"slams,\" regional performances and community service outings. The team returned to Philadelphia with very little fanfare, and the students went right back to attending Saturday writing workshops. Catching the attention of news outlets was the latest flash mob to plague the city in recent months. Flash mobs in the City of Brotherly Love aren't the singing and dancing kind uploaded to YouTube. Instead, flash mobs in Philadelphia are violent eruptions in which mobs of teens run through the streets attacking people and damaging property. Over the weekend, Philadelphia police arrested three juveniles and a 19-year-old on charges of assault, reckless endangerment and robbery after a rampaging mob struck the Center City area, causing minor injuries to two people, according to police. \"It's very frustrating. While that's going on we have kids who are waking up on Saturday to go to a writing workshop,\" Divirgilio said. \"It's hard to keep telling my kids to keep doing well when the ones causing problems get the attention.\" A safe outlet . Kai Davis is still in disbelief that her team won. She joined the team in January after meeting up with a friend at one of the group's Saturday writing workshops. \"Winning wasn't on my mind, it was doing the best that we could,\" said Davis, an incoming high school senior who performed the poem \"Femininjas,\" a social critique on the harassment of women, at the finals alongside teammate Charmira Nelson. \"I have fallen in love with spoken word and don't want to stop writing.\" The group provides a safe place for personal growth for youth who might otherwise have gone unnoticed, she said, adding that it is disappointing to have flash mobs be the face of Philadelphia youth. \"Most of the people in PYPM don't have a structured family, but it hasn't made them worse people,\" she said. \"They wouldn't be out shooting or getting in trouble, they'd be out there trying to survive.\" Visiting San Francisco was the farthest Jamarr Hall has ever traveled from home. The group helped him find his voice, said Hall, a 19-year-old plumber's apprentice who graduated high school in June 2010. He joined the poetry group after hearing about it at an after-school poetry workshop hosted by his English class. \"It's a chance to show people what I can do on and off stage. I believe I have yet to reach my peak and I'm not stopping here,\" said Hall, whose mother died when he was 8. \"We should be known for things other than playing sports or flash mobs.\"\n### Response : ", "target": "Students from Philadelphia win National poetry contest in San Francisco .\nThey prepared six days a week for the competition, where they performed before judges .\nTeam wants to show city has teens who are doing positive things with lives .\nPhiladelphia has had problems with flash mobs -- group attacks on people and property .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Police in Caryville, Tennessee, said the daughter is 19 and not assigned to a legal guardian. \"As terrible as it is, unfortunately there is nothing we can do,\" Assistant Police Chief Stephanie Smith said. \"There is no doubt we need a law for mental health rights, but pending this investigation, we just don't know what else to do.\" According to police, Eva Cameron stopped at the Big Orange Bar in Caryville on June 28 when her daughter, Lynn, needed to use the restroom.

The young woman's identity was unknown until Caryville police received an anonymous tip on Monday, having released a picture and requested information from the public.

She signed a statement saying that Lynn Cameron was now a ward of Tennessee, officials said. \"She basically said, 'I don't want her and I don't want to take her.'

When reached later Tuesday by CNN, Eva Cameron said, \"We understand she lost her ID card and that's how the situation has turned into what happened. She's already an adult. I just have to leave it at that.\" Eva Cameron would not answer further questions. Authorities took Lynn Cameron to a hospital, where she was discovered to have only a basic vocabulary of 30-40 words, according to Smith. A Campbell County Chancery Court order in the case described Lynn Cameron as a \"severely disabled adult, suffering from profound mental deficits, and is unable to care for herself or her personal needs.\" According to the court, the mother stated \"she could not and would not care for Lynn Cameron.\" Eva Cameron said that she has another disabled child and that caring for both was too much to handle, according to the Northwest Herald.

His father, Tim Tierney, said he isn't sure when his son will arrive at his Portsmouth, New Hampshire, home, but said he is scheduled to be released from the facility Wednesday. Christopher Tierney suffered four broken ribs; a hairline skull fracture; a broken scapula, or shoulder blade; a bruised lung; three cracked vertebrae; and broken bones below his elbow in the December 20 fall, the elder Tierney has said. Tim Tierney said his son is improving. \"He is up,\" he said. \"He is walking and just doing very well.\" He said Christopher Tierney cannot wait to return to the show, \"Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark.\" Several of the shows were canceled following Tierney's fall, and new safety precautions were put in place before they resumed following a meeting between the show's company, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the New York State Department of Labor. The show, with music and lyrics by U2's Bono and Howell (aka The Edge), is the most expensive in Broadway history, but production has been beset by cast injuries and technical problems. Once Christopher Tierney is home, his family plans a belated Christmas celebration, Tim Tierney said.

However, he said, Tongans had \"mixed feelings here in the community\" about the king. \"He lived a bachelor life, always a single man, and he traveled a lot around the world and spent money. He brought us in some ways forward into the 21st century, but some people have different -- not as good -- views on him.\" Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard expressed her condolences in a statement Monday, crediting George V with guiding \"his country through a critical process of constitutional change towards the establishment of a constitutional monarchy.\" Tonga, with a population of 106,000, is the only monarchy that remains in the Pacific. George V ascended to the throne after the death of his father in September 2006 and quickly promised to speed up government reforms demanded by the people. \"Let us rebuild a new capital and a new Tonga,\" George V said in 2006, a week after a pro-democracy rally in the capital city of Nuku'alofa led to riots that left eight people dead and the central business district in ruins. In 2008, he announced he was giving up most of the near-absolute power that his family held for centuries and allowing the prime minister to guide the day-to-day governmental affairs.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you briefly describe the text?\n### Input:(CNN) -- Florida recorded its first death connected to the outbreak of a rare, noncontagious form of meningitis, raising the toll Tuesday to a total of 12 fatalities nationwide. Earlier in the day, federal authorities reported 11 deaths and 119 persons becoming ill in the outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Tuesday. Those figures were an increase from Monday's count of eight deaths and 105 illnesses. Florida health officials also reported a total of six cases connected to the outbreak -- all in Marion County. That figure -- one more than federal officials have so far counted in Florida -- means that a total of 120 persons nationwide have become ill, according to state officials. The outbreak is linked to contaminated steroid injections, and as many as 13,000 people may have received the medicine between May 21 and September 24, the CDC said. The death of a 70-year-old Florida man occurred in July, prior to the discovery of the contamination, the state's health department said. \"Our disease investigation process discovered the link of this individual's death to the contaminated medication,\" State Surgeon General and Secretary of Health Dr. John Armstrong said. \"We will continue to work closely with our health partners to ensure that individuals who may have received the contaminated medicine are treated immediately.\" The number of reported cases grew significantly in recent days as federal and state authorities continued to investigate the outbreak. Tennessee is the hardest-hit state, with 39 infections and six deaths, according to the CDC. Of the remaining deaths, three occurred in Michigan and one each in Maryland and Virginia, the CDC said. Patients contracted the deadly fungal meningitis after being injected in their spines with a preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate that was contaminated by a fungus. The steroid is used to treat pain and inflammation. Meningitis outbreak: Your questions answered . The New England Compounding Center (NECC), the Massachusetts-based pharmacy that made the contaminated injections, voluntarily recalled three lots of the injected steroid last week. On Tuesday, President James T. DeVita of the Massachusetts State Board of Registration in Pharmacy sympathized with the individuals affected by the contamination. \"On behalf of the board, I want to express our deepest sympathy for the patients and the families who have been impacted by this tragedy,\" DeVita said, reading from a statement during a board meeting. He added that \"NECC voluntarily surrendered its license and recalled all implicated products.\" On Saturday, the pharmacy announced a voluntary nationwide recall of all its other products as well. NECC said the new recall was being announced out of an abundance of caution and that there is no indication any of its other products are contaminated. The Food and Drug Administration has already asked doctors, clinics and consumers to stop using any of the pharmacy's products. Last week, the pharmacy voluntarily surrendered its license to operate until the FDA investigation into the contamination is complete. Health officials say 75 medical facilities in 23 states received the contaminated steroid injections from NECC. Other than Tennessee, deaths have been reported in Maryland, Michigan and Virginia. There are also confirmed cases of the disease in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Ohio. The other states that received the contaminated products are California, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Nevada, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia. Federal health inspectors began inspecting the NECC plant October 1. Inspectors found foreign particles in unopened vials, and after testing one of them, they determined the substance was a fungus. The investigation is still under way. Nearly 10% of drugs administered in the United States come from compound pharmacies, according to a 2003 Government Accountability Office report. Drugs manufactured by compound pharmacies do not have to go through FDA-mandated premarket approval. Instead, state health pharmacy boards are responsible for the oversight and licensing of these pharmacies. Compound pharmacists create customized medication solutions for patients for whom manufactured pharmaceuticals won't work, according to the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists. Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by an infection, frequently with bacteria or a virus, but it can also be caused by less common pathogens like fungi, according to the CDC. Fungal meningitis is very rare and, unlike viral and bacterial meningitis, is not contagious. Symptoms of fungal meningitis are similar to symptoms of other forms of meningitis, but they often appear more gradually and can be very mild at first, the CDC says. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told CNN that fungal infections are not usually mild. He said when a fungus invades small blood vessels, it can cause them to clot or bleed, which can lead to symptoms of small strokes. In addition to typical meningitis symptoms like headache, fever, nausea and stiffness of the neck, people with fungal meningitis may also experience confusion, dizziness and discomfort from bright lights. Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms, the CDC says. Health officials say any patients who received an injection at one of the facilities beginning May 21 and who began showing symptoms between one and three weeks after being injected should see their doctor right away. The earlier a patient gets treatment, the more likely he or she will survive. Patients are treated with anti-fungal medication, which is given intravenously, so patients have to be admitted to the hospital, the CDC said. Patients may need to be treated for months. The FDA is urging anyone who has experienced problems following an injection with the NECC product to report it to MedWatch, the FDA's voluntary reporting program, by phone at 1-800-FDA-1088 or online at www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Elizabeth Cohen, Miriam Falco, Michael Martinez and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.\n### Response : ", "target": "NEW: Florida records its first death in meningitis outbreak and reports additional case of illness .\nCDC: As many as 13,000 people may have received possibly contaminated injections .\nThe outbreak of a rare form of meningitis is noncontagious, the CDC says .\nA Massachusetts official expresses \"deepest sympathy\" for those affected .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The defection of the four North Koreans could spark tensions on the peninsula, where joint U.S.-South Korea military drills have kicked off this week. North Korea had threatened to engulf Seoul in a \"sea of flames,\" a day before the opening of the exercise. The South will return the remaining 27 members of the group through Panmunjom, a truce village on the ground border between the two sides, and send the fishing boat back through the waters in the West Sea on Friday, the Red Cross said.

There are currently more than 20,000 North Korean defectors in South Korea, according to the South's Unification Ministry. The number of annual defectors has risen dramatically since the turn of the century and continues to climb. Defectors who are forcefully repatriated to the North after attempting to cross over into third countries such as China, Mongolia or Southeast Asia are commonly sent to prison camps as a punishment.

All eight of the carriages on the train came off the rails, with five completely overturning, causing 18 dead and 187 injured. \n  \n In the 12-second video, the train can be seen rapidly approaching as it rounds a bend. Suddenly, the train's engine starts to lean to its left before leaping off the tracks and rolling onto its left side. \n  \n The engine continues to skid at a high speed along the tracks as its trailing carriages each bounce off the the tracks one after the other. Sparks starts to fly and smoke begins to billow as the lead engine and trailing carriages crash into poles supporting the overhead power lines and each other. \n  \n Apple Daily reported that the accident took place on a curve in the track, while the Automatic Train Protection System (ATP) had been disabled prior to departure due to a malfunction, and that could have contributed to derailing the train, permitting it to go too fast for the curve, according to people familiar with the matter. The system is designed to enforce adherence to a commanded speed pattern and to prevent accidents. TRA emphasized the cause is still under investigation. \n  \n However, at a press conference today, Chief secretary of TRA, Chu Lai-shun (\u6731\u4f86\u9806) said that the driver of the train reported a problem with \"low (air) pressure\" just before the accident occurred. Chu emphasized that based on the investigation thus far, no evidence has been found showing that the derailment was related to the disabling of ATP. |||||\n### Response: ", "target": "\u2013 Investigators are still trying to piece together what caused a high-speed passenger train to crash in Taiwan over the weekend, killing at least 18 and injuring nearly 200 others.

{"source": "### Instruction:Read the following passage and summarize it.in a recent issue of critical care , chapman and colleagues   report a study aiming to quantify glucose absorption and the relationships between gastric emptying , glucose absorption and glycaemia in critically ill patients . \n this study follows many publications from the same australian group that have contributed greatly to better our understanding of gastrointestinal failure during critical illness . \n they analysed the kinetics of glucose absorption , glycaemia modifications , and gastric emptying after a test meal in 19 critically ill patients , with comparison to healthy volunteers . \n the test meal was administered by nasogastric bolus , however , a modality of administration somewhat different from the classic continuous intragastric infusion . some of their findings were expected from previous work , while others clearly challenge our present beliefs . in agreement with many previous studies , \n the rate of gastric emptying was reduced in critically ill patients and , consequently , the rate of glucose absorption was found to be reduced . \n glucose absorption in this study was measured using 3-o methylglucose ( 3-o mg ) . like glucose , 3-o mg is actively absorbed by enterocytes ( through sodium glucose co - transporter-1 ) , but it is not metabolized ; therefore , kinetic parameters obtained from sequential plasma concentrations as well as urinary excretion following digestive administration have been used as markers of glucose absorption . since absorption of this sugar occurs almost exclusively in the intestine , gastric emptying should logically influence the rate of 3-o mg absorption after intragastric administration , an observation that chapman and colleagues confirmed . \n the finding that 3-o mg absorption is still decreased in the subset of patients with normal gastric emptying is more surprising , however , and calls out for additional explanation . besides gastric emptying , \n numerous factors may theoretically influence the kinetics of 3-o mg absorption , including mucosal integrity , the number of sodium glucose co - transporters , small intestine peristalsis , blood flow , the volume of distribution of the substance , and alterations in renal clearance . \n the hypothesis of impaired intestinal absorption of glucose in critically ill patients has received little attention so far ; indeed , many icu physicians still consider that nutrients are absorbed completely provided that they have passed beyond the pylorus . \n increasing evidence may indicate , however , that this concept is obsolete , and energy loss through mal - absorption may be an overlooked problem in icu patients . using bomb calorimetry , a method to quantify the energetic losses in faecal material , investigators demonstrated substantial loss of calories in the faeces of icu patients , most of them fed postpylorically ; in 13 patients with a faeces collector because of loose stools , the caloric value of energy loss was a mean of 301 kcal / day , and 3 patients had a loss of more than 500 kcal / day in the stools . \n decreased intestinal absorption in icu patients may conceivably be multifactorial ; gut mucosal atrophy and decreased splanchnic perfusion have been described extensively during critical illness . \n also , digestive secretory function ( essential for degradation of more complex nutrients ) may be qualitatively or quantitatively affected , as neurohumoral control is frequently impaired . \n furthermore , intestinal motility is possibly inappropriate for optimal digestion and absorption of nutrients due to the persistence of migrating motor complexes during feeding . \n in particular , caution should be taken when interpreting the kinetics of 3-o mg ( to represent glucose ) absorption in the icu setting . \n icu patients do indeed show pharmacokinetic differences compared with normal individuals , including increased volume of distribution and variable clearance of substances . in septic patients , \n the volume of distribution of hydrophilic substances is often greater due to an increased capillary permeability resulting in fluid shifts from the intravascular compartment to the interstitial space . \n distribution volume may also be increased in icu patients by the presence of mechanical ventilation , hypoalbuminaemia ( increased capillary leakage ) , extracorporeal circuits , postsurgical drains , or burn injury . \n the resulting effect would be a decreased plasma concentration of the molecule with a risk of misinterpretation of some important kinetic parameters ( area under concentration - time curve , maximal concentration , time to peak concentration ) . \n this may be of particular relevance if the sampling period is relatively short . to circumvent this problem , quantification of urinary excretion of the test substance during prolonged urinary collection \n alternatively , the so called ' dual probe ' method has been proposed ; in this method , simultaneous administration of probe substances that respond in a similar way to variables such as extra - cellular fluid volume or renal clearance enables calculation of urinary excretion ratios , thereby eliminating the effect of these factors . another observation from chapman and \n colleagues ' study is the finding that gastric emptying was inversely related to baseline blood glucose , such that elevated blood glucose levels were associated with slower gastric emptying . \n this confirms previous data from animal as well as human studies demonstrating a deleterious effect of hyperglycaemia on gastric emptying . \n also , previous studies have suggested that small intestinal   and gallbladder motility   may be inhibited by a hyperglycaemic state . \n glucose control may thus be important for optimal tolerance and absorption of nutrients in icu patients . \n future work should thus aim to confirm whether absorptive capacity of the gut is indeed impaired during critical illness and to determine the causes and mechanisms of this . with this aim in view , further development and validation of tools enabling reliable assessment of nutrient absorption in the icu setting \n  \n \n### Response: ", "target": "this commentary highlights the contribution of the article by chapman and colleagues assessing the relationships between glucose absorption , glycaemia and gastric emptying during critical illness . \n in addition to several more expected findings , their data suggest that factors other than slow gastric emptying may limit glucose absorption during critical illness . this hypothesis has received little attention so far , although numerous small intestinal abnormalities possibly interfering with absorption are known to occur in intensive care patients . future work should focus on further validation of tools to assess nutrient absorption in the critically ill , before defining the precise causes and mechanisms that are involved .", "origin": "pubmed.csv"}

Now, apparently, not even your phone charger is safe. A team of researchers from Georgia Tech say they've discovered, and can demonstrate, a way to to hack into an iPhone or iPad in less than a minute using a \"malicious charger.\" The team plans to demonstrate its findings at the Black Hat computer security conference, which begins July 27 in Las Vegas. In a preview of its presentation, the team acknowledges Apple's \"plethora of defense mechanisms in iOS.\" Historically, Mac users have been able to boast of being largely malware free, in part because spammers, scammers and hackers preferred to target the larger number of Windows computers in the world. On its mobile iOS operating system, Apple has created a \"closed garden\" environment in which everything from apps to accessories has to be approved by Apple, as opposed to Google's more wide-open Android system. But by attacking in a nontraditional way, the team of Billy Lau, Yeongjin Jang and Chengyu Song say, those defenses can be bypassed. \"(W)e investigated the extent to which security threats were considered when performing everyday activities such as charging a device,\" they wrote. \"The results were alarming: despite the plethora of defense mechanisms in iOS, we successfully injected arbitrary software into current-generation Apple devices running the latest operating system (OS) software. \"All users are affected, as our approach requires neither a jailbroken device nor user interaction.\" The team says they have built a malicious charger named Mactans, which they plan to demonstrate at Black Hat. Latrodectus mactans is the scientific name for the deadly black widow spider. The preview doesn't say whether the charger is a modified version of Apple's standard equipment or entirely new. \"While Mactans was built with limited amount of time and a small budget, we also briefly consider what more motivated, well-funded adversaries could accomplish,\" they wrote. \"Finally, we recommend ways in which users can protect themselves and suggest security features Apple could implement to make the attacks we describe substantially more difficult to pull off.\" Apple did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n### Response : ", "target": "Researchers say they can hack Apple mobile devices through the charger .\nGeorgia Tech team will present findings at Black Hat security conference .\nClaim: Malicious charger \"Mactans\" can hack iOS in less than a minute .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Almost 600 items are being offered in RR Auction's Space & Aviation online sale, which begins Thursday and runs through May 22. For space enthusiasts, the highlights may be artifacts from NASA's Apollo lunar missions, including several pieces of rare equipment: . -- A complete Apollo 15 Rotational Hand Controller used by Commander David Scott to fly and land his lunar module on the surface of the moon in 1971. Bidding starts at $10,000. -- A Crewman Optical Alignment Sight used by Scott for rendezvous, docking and star sightings during the lunar module phases of the mission. Bidding starts at $2,500. Both pieces came from Scott's personal collection and are likely to be prized by collectors. \"These items represent the pinnacle of Apollo-era flown material,\" said Richard Jurek, co-author of \"Marketing the Moon: The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program.\" \"While risking their lives during the most critical and historic phases of their mission, these are the items that the astronauts personally selected to retain as mementos from arguably the greatest technological and engineering achievement of the 20th century.\" Seventy items from Apollo 11 -- the first manned mission to land on the moon -- will be offered, including pieces from the personal collections of Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. Items from other Apollo missions as well as Mercury, Gemini, and space shuttle missions also are being auctioned. Other artifacts include signed maps, patches, photos, and even a full spacesuit. RR Auction has been around for more than 30 years and specializes in rare documents, manuscripts, autographs and historical artifacts. This will be the site's seventh auction that has focused on human aviation and space exploration. Much of the equipment used on NASA missions has been left behind on the moon or sent drifting into the vastness of space. And many items that return from space missions are stored away in private collections or donated to museums, which is why rare auctions of spaceflight memorabilia draw interest from aviation enthusiasts. \"Objects coming directly from moon walkers and that have been in private collections since returning to Earth are unquestionably the most sought after,\" said Bobby Livingston, executive vice present of RR Auction.\n### Response :", "target": "Hundreds of rare aviation- and space-related artifacts are going on the auction block .\nAmong them: Items brought to the moon on the Apollo lunar missions .\nOnline auction begins Thursday and runs through May 22 .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?\n### Input:(CNN) -- Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, received an experimental medicine nearly a week after being admitted into the hospital -- a far longer wait than experienced by four other Ebola patients treated in the United States. Those patients -- two each at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital and the University of Nebraska Medical Center -- received their experimental medicines immediately. Those four are U.S. citizens; Duncan is a Liberian national. Duncan died Wednesday at the Texas hospital where he was being treated, 10 days after he was admitted. \"We feel he didn't get the medicine and treatment for the disease because he's African and they don't consider him as important as the other three,\" Josephus Weeks, Duncan's nephew, said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon, a day before Duncan died. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who attended that press conference with Weeks and Duncan's mother as a newly appointed spokesman for the family, said, \"We don't feel good about that. It's been a concern he had to wait so long.\" Jackson said he thinks money also played a role in Duncan's treatment. \"I would tend to think that those who do not have insurance, those who do not have Medicaid do not have the same priorities as those who do,\" the civil rights leader said. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said Duncan was \"treated the way any other patient would have been treated, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care. We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area.\" The hospitals that took care of the four other patients had substantial advance notice that patients were on their way. Duncan went the emergency room at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on September 25, but staff there didn't realize he had Ebola and sent him home hours later. He was admitted on September 28 when the hospital realized he had the disease. He started receiving the experimental drug, brincidofovir, on October 4. \"Mr. Duncan succumbed to an insidious disease, Ebola,\" hospital spokesman Wendell Watson said in a statement. \"He fought courageously in this battle. Our professionals, the doctors and nurses in the unit, as well as the entire Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas community, are also grieving his passing.\" Thomas Eric Duncan: First Ebola death in U.S. Since the drugs being used to treat Ebola are still experimental, it is up to each individual hospital to file the paperwork with the Food and Drug Administration for permission to get the drug from the manufacturer and use it. The agency received the request to use brincidofovir on October 3, five days after Duncan entered the hospital, Stephanie Yao, a spokeswoman for the FDA, said Wednesday. \"The care team has been consulting with the CDC and Emory, on a daily basis since Mr. Duncan was admitted to the hospital, discussing the possible course of treatment, including the use of investigational drugs,\" Watson, the hospital spokesman, said in a statement. The FDA and Chimerix, the company that makes the drug, said if there was any delay it wasn't on their part. Yao said she couldn't comment on any particular case, but when doctors make requests for experimental Ebola treatments, \"we turn them around in a matter of a few hours -- often less than one hour.\" Ebola drugs are in the works . Joseph Schepers, a spokesman for Chimerix, said requests to use brincidofovir \"are expedited immediately in the most expedited way you could possibly do it.\" \"It's a general rule in medicine that the earlier you start therapy in a sick person who needs the therapy, the better the response,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, when asked about the impact of the wait for the drug. Weeks said he and his family had to \"pressure\" the hospital to apply for permission to give the drug, brincidofovir, to Duncan. \"They were treating him with oxygen, water and a bed to lay on,\" he said. Weeks and Jackson said they believe the hospital applied for permission to use brincidofovir only after Jackson gave out the hospital's phone number on his radio show last week and urged listeners to call in and complain. Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance NBC cameraman, was admitted to the University of Nebraska Medical Center Tuesday and began receiving brincidofovir the same day. Dr. Rick Sacra received another experimental drug called TKM-Ebola, which is easier to access but still requires permission from the FDA. Dr. Kent Brantley and Nancy Writebol -- both treated at Emory -- took Zmapp, which is no longer available because the company ran out of supplies of the drug.

In order to win passage of the authorization, Obama will have to persuade 270 members to vote \"yes\" -- a heavy lift, considering there are currently only 25 members who say they plan to vote \"yes\" on military action, 17 Democrats and eight Republicans. The number of \"yes\" votes has only increased by two since Friday. A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday shows that even though eight in 10 Americans believe that Bashar al-Assad's regime gassed its own people, a strong majority don't want Congress to pass a resolution authorizing a military strike against it. Since Obama unexpectedly asked Congress in August to authorize military action in Syria, polls have found that Americans are opposed to such action. The Senate has been more receptive than the House to Obama's authorization request. There are currently 25 \"yes\" and 23 \"no\" votes in the Senate, with a significant 52 senators undecided. But the trend favors the \"no\" votes -- with a handful of moderate Democrats in the last three days coming out against the proposal. \"After doing my due diligence, I believe we need an alternative path forward in dealing with the Assad regime,\" said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota in a statement. \"We must balance the legitimate concerns that Americans have about the use of military force with our strategic interests.\" Other Democratic senators echoed Heitkamp: Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mark Begich of Alaska. Pryor issued a statement Saturday saying Obama and his national security team had not yet made an effective case for taking action against al-Assad's regime and laying out the criteria that had to be met in order for him to support military action in Syria. \"Based on the information presented to me and the evidence I have gathered, I do not believe these criteria have been met,\" Pryor said. Begich told people on a telephone town hall last week that he was a \"probable no\" on Syrian authorization. \"This has probably been the No. 1 issue, especially in the last week, that Alaskans have been contacting my office, as well as when I was back home for the last month,\" Begich said. Because of the possibility of a filibuster, Obama and supporters need 60 votes in the Senate to win passage. Despite the vocal opposition and light support, majorities in both the House and Senate remain undecided on the proposal, and the White House is putting on the hard sell to court those possible \"yes\" votes. The Senate is expected to take up the resolution after returning from its month-long summer recess Monday. White House officials will travel to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to try to make their case with lawmakers, hours before Obama addresses the nation in a prime-time speech.\n### Response : ", "target": "Lawmakes who plan to vote against military action say their constituents oppose it .\nThe number of those who plan to vote \"no\" grew significantly over the weekend .\nObama will take his pitch to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to try to find more \"yes\" votes .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction: Give me a one line summary of the story below:\n### Input:(CNN) -- Even if you've never visited Malaysia or Indonesia, it's likely that you've made contact with these countries through the chocolate bar you've just eaten or the soap you've just washed your hands with. Over 87% of palm oil, a common ingredient in thousands of consumer commodities, was produced by the two countries in the past year, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Palm oil remains solid at room temperature, making it a remarkably versatile commodity used in cooking and processed food products like ice cream and cookies, as well as biofuels, agro-chemicals, and consumer products such as soaps, detergents, and cosmetics. As a result, demand for palm oil has been steadily rising since the 1970s, making it hugely valuable \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and profitable. Last week, Malaysian state-owned palm oil conglomerate Felda Global Ventures Holdings debuted on the Bursa Malaysia stock exchange in the world's second largest Initial Public Offering (IPO) this year. The share price of the world's third largest palm oil operator rose by 20%, generating US$3.2 billion for the company. While the IPO has been a boon for the company's coffers, conservationists say the palm oil industry has been a curse for the environment in Malaysia and Indonesia. Palm oil production threatens tropical forests, peatlands, and wildlife habitats, environmental groups such as Greenpeace say. More than 10% of deforestation in Malaysia and Indonesia over the last 20 years occurred to make way for palm oil plantations, according to a report by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). In Indonesia, an average of 300,000 hectares is lost annually to palm oil clearing, the report said. One of the major consequences of deforestation is the effect on climate change. \"Because forested land, especially forested peatland, has a high carbon density, the production of palm oil on deforested lands causes disproportionately greater...global warming emissions than an equal area of non-forested land,\" according to the UCS report. The group estimates that growing and refining each metric ton of crude palm oil produces the equivalent of 0.86 metric ton of carbon dioxide or 860 kilograms. Each hectare of carbon-rich peatland drained to plant oil palms releases an estimated 3,750-5,400 tons of carbon dioxide over 25 years, said Wirendro Sumargo, a forest campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia. By comparison, he said, 500-900 tons of carbon dioxide are released from clearing a hectare of tropical forest without peat bogs. Oil palms also have less biomass than the natural forests they replace, meaning the trees store much less carbon dioxide, according to UCS. Once oil palms reach the end of their productive life cycle, the destruction of their timber also returns carbon to the atmosphere. To harvest palm oil in an environmentally safe way, high carbon stock forests, peatlands, and high conservation value forests must be avoided for development, said Sumargo. He added that the Indonesian government has routinely granted concessions for oil palm development in forested areas, which has led to widespread deforestation in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The UCS also claims the government issues land leases on favorable terms to an elite, influential pool of investors. For example, the Sinar Mas Group, which owns one of the country's leading palm oil growers-refineries, is controlled by the powerful Widjaja family empire. The company has been an ongoing target of heavy criticism from green groups for contributing to mass deforestation and the endangerment of wildlife. Over the past five years, Greenpeace has launched campaigns against snack food conglomerates, including Unilever and Nestle, after finding their products, such as Nestle's Kit Kat chocolate bars, contained palm oil sourced from the Sinar Mas Group. Deforestation forces large animals, such as tigers, elephants and orangutans, into small and isolated pieces of natural habitat, according to Sumargo. While the campaigns increased consumer awareness and provoked Unilever and Nestle to suspend their contracts until Sinar Mas improved its practices, much work remains to be done to make the palm oil industry sustainable, environmental groups say. For its part, the Indonesia government implemented a two-year moratorium on new permits to clear primary forests in May 2011, in a US$1B deal with Norway intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions stemming from deforestation. Others point out that the palm oil industry has significantly alleviated rural poverty in Indonesia, where over 10% of the rural population lives below the poverty line. According to World Growth, over 41% of palm oil plantations were owned by small landowners in 2008, producing 6.6 million tons of palm oil. The palm oil industry contributes approximately 4.5% of gross domestic product in Indonesia, according to the USDA. Felda Global Ventures manages nearly 425,000 hectares of land in Malaysia and Indonesia, the majority of which is used for oil palm cultivation, according to its website. Its associate company, Felda Holdings, produced 3.3 million tons of crude palm oil in fiscal 2011, according to company spokesman Izan Hussain. Hussain said that company's last plantings of oil palms occurred in the 1990s. \"Going forward, in newly acquired areas, where it involves planting in secondary forest areas, FGV will only do so after conducting high conservation value assessment,\" he said. \"We will only proceed if the findings indicate that no wildlife or endangered species will be affected, nor any social conflicts will arise from the development of the land.\" The company has a program in place to obtain certification from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) for all 70 of their palm oil mills by 2017, according to Hussain. He said that only eight mills are currently certified.\n### Response:", "target": "Over 87% of palm oil produced by Malaysia and Indonesia in past year .\nPalm oil is versatile ingredient in thousands of consumer commodities .\nDemand for palm oil steadily rising since the 1970s, making it hugely profitable .\nGreen groups say palm oil industry threatens tropical forests, peatlands, and wildlife habitats .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Deadly bombings in two London parks on July 20, 1982 represented a dark day in the bloody conflict between Irish republicans and the British government -- now their legacy threatens to derail Northern Ireland's hard-fought peace process. Eleven British soldiers -- some members of Queen Elizabeth II's Household Cavalry regiment, others part of a military band -- died during blasts in Hyde Park and Regent's Park. One of the men accused of being behind the Hyde Park attack -- believed to have been carried out by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) -- walked free this week after it emerged in court that he had a letter from the British government from 2007 -- the 25th anniversary of the bombings -- assuring him he did not face prosecution for IRA crimes. Prosecutors argued the letter was sent \"in error\" to John Anthony Downey, 62, and that authorities at the time had failed to register an outstanding warrant for his arrest in connection with the 1982 attack. Downey, who denies planting the bomb that killed four of the soldiers, was not the only one to be given immunity. Almost 200 other Irish republican terror suspects were too. Covert deal . According to British media, 187 so-called \"comfort letters\" were sent to suspected IRA terrorists such as Downey -- known as \"on the runs\" -- who sought clarification about their status after a peace settlement in 1998, known as the Good Friday Agreement, which brought the decades-long \"troubles\" in Northern Ireland to an end. The letters were part of a covert deal struck between the British government and republicans -- who bitterly opposed British rule -- to ease the reconciliation process. Now the historic power-sharing government in Northern Ireland -- which brought unionists and republicans together -- appears in grave danger of collapsing. The top lawmaker in the administration, First Minister Peter Robinson, said it had been plunged into crisis over the deal allowing suspected terrorists to walk free. Robinson has threatened to resign, saying he had been kept in the dark over the years about the secret \"letters of assurance.\" He said he only found out after the London court judgment. And he's supposed to be in charge here. His partner in government, Martin McGuinness -- himself a former IRA commander -- urged him to pull back from the brink of bringing down the government. The nationalist Sinn Fein leader took to social media to say: \"My unionist colleagues need to calm down. We've all come a long way. No sensible person will thank anyone for threatening the institutions.\" British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, stressed the British government \"does not support amnesties for people wanted by the police in connection with terrorist offenses,\" and that Downey \"was part of an administrative scheme for dealing with 'on-the-runs' set up by the previous government.\" She added that the government would be working with the police to identify whether there are other cases similar to that of Downey. Imperfect peace . The tension is a sign of the times in Northern Ireland. There's peace but an imperfect one. The bombings and sectarian murders have largely stopped, although small groupings of IRA dissidents continue to pose a threat. Pro-British paramilitary groups also remain active. Emotions continue to run high between the pro-British and pro-Irish communities over issues such as parades and the flying of the British Union flag. The parades are particularly controversial -- groups from both sides of the unionist/nationalist divide would claim they hold marches as a celebration of their culture, while critics would argue they are asserting their rights over communities across Northern Ireland. American diplomat Richard N. Haass was flown into Belfast to chair all-party talks last year in a bid to find a resolution to outstanding issues -- the talks ended without agreement. Marching season . Through it all, the power-sharing administration at Stormont -- Northern Ireland's Parliament Buildings -- in Belfast has held. The present-day political and economic challenges were being worked through. But the past has proved more difficult to deal with. And with elections on the horizon, compromise might not be viewed as a policy to win votes. Another controversial summer marching season looms with the prospect of violent clashes at disputed locations. The trouble tends to be confined to certain neighborhoods, mainly working class districts of Belfast. But the shockwaves can be felt across Northern Ireland. IRA dissidents lurk in the background desperate to launch attacks. Many victims of decades of paramilitary violence believe their voices are being ignored. Of course, there are many economic challenges too, with a sluggish economy and an unemployment rate above the UK average. It promises to be an interesting year in Northern Ireland. And while the politicians fight, the vast majority of people on both sides of the religious divide are united -- praying for peace.\n### Response:", "target": "1982 IRA bomb attacks on two London parks killed 11 British soldiers .\nSuspect walks free, one of many terror suspects given immunity as part of peace process .\nNorthern Ireland's top lawmaker has threatened to quit over these covert deals .\nFears this could break up historic power-sharing government and threaten peace .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

He was 81. Dean, a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, was with his wife, Donna, at the time of his death, which appears to be from natural causes, said R.J. Clark of the Henrico County Police department. Musically, Dean is best known for his song \"Big Bad John,\" which made it to No. 1 on both the country and pop charts in 1961 and was honored with a Grammy. His narrative style of song also produced hits like \"Little Black Book\" and \"P.T. 109\" -- a song about John F. Kennedy's command in the South Pacific during World War II. Starting in 1963, he hosted a successful variety show on ABC called \"The Jimmy Dean Show,\" which ran for three years. Regulars on the program included Roger Miller and puppeteer Jim Henson, making Rowlf -- a piano-playing dog -- an early Muppet favorite. In the late 1960s Dean also appeared regularly on the NBC series \"Daniel Boone.\" He played Boone's friend Josh Clements. At about the same time, Dean started the Jimmy Dean Meat Company. Dean eventually sold his meat company to Sara Lee Foods in 1984, but remained its chairman and TV spokesman, which kept him in the public eye until recent years. Dean was born Seth Ward in Olton, Texas, on August 10, 1928. His mom taught him piano starting at age 10, but he also learned how to play the guitar, harmonica, and accordion. After his discharge from the Air Force in 1948 he put together a band called the Texas Wildcats and played in the Washington, D.C., area . \"We played every dive in Washington at one time or another,\" Dean said in his biography on the Country Music Hall of Fame website. \"And dives is what they were.\" Dean was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame this year.

The city is expected to fall below 500 murders in 2007, the lowest level for any year since 1963, when comparable information on homicides was first collected, Bloomberg said at a news conference. \"At the end of 2002, for the first time in four decades, murders in New York City fell below 600, and we were able to hold them below 600 for the next four years,\" Bloomberg said. \"Today, with just five days of the year remaining, it appears that we have another historic achievement within our reach.\" Bloomberg said decreases in major felony crimes were recorded across every crime category and in all five boroughs in 2007, marking the seventeenth straight year in which crime has gone down. Since 2001, overall major felony crime has decreased 26 percent citywide, according to New York Police Department statistics.  Watch how the city achieved success \u00bb . Declines in domestic violence-related homicides and transit crime particularly stand out, Bloomberg told reporters. Domestic violence-related murders dropped a record 36 percent this year, the mayor said. The decline coincides with an effort by NYPD that doubled visits of specially trained detectives to households where domestic violence had occurred, officials noted. Crime in the subway system in 2007 fell 13 percent below the record low numbers recorded last year, despite subway ridership that's at an all-time high. Officials name \"Operation Impact\" as the prime reason for the decline in crime. The NYPD effort focuses on problem people and places, Kelly said. It places significant numbers of uniformed officers in small areas of precincts, where crime rates are relatively high. Given the success of Operation Impact, the NYPD will assign all of this year's Police Academy graduates to the program, Kelly said. Officials also credited an improved police and community partnership for the overall decline in crime. \"We are not the same New York that we were in 1990, a year when more than 2,000 people were murdered,\" Bloomberg said. \"We're also not the same city we were in 2001, when many predicted that our crime-fighting gains would soon be a point of diminishing returns.\"  E-mail to a friend .\n### Response:", "target": "Murders in New York City were below 600 for five straight years, Bloomberg says .\nNYPD: Since 2001, overall major felony crime decreased 26 percent citywide .\nMayor: Domestic violence-related murders dropped a record 36 percent this year .\nNYPD: Success due to putting significant numbers of officers in troubled precincts .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Could you highlight the primary messages?\n### Input:(CNN) -- The music of Hugh Masekela is the sound of South Africa. In a career that has spanned more than 50 years his songs have expressed both joy and indignation, exploring themes of inequality and hardship, protest and hope. Hugh Masekela, still an inspiration. More than just an inspirational musician, Masekela was an inspirational campaigner against apartheid and is now helping to build a new South Africa. Masekela was born on 4 April 1939, in Witbank, South Africa. He started playing the piano when he was six, but seeing Kirk Douglas play a jazz trumpeter in the movie \"Young Man with a Horn\" inspired him to switch instruments. When he was 14, he was given his first trumpet by the chaplain at his school, renowned anti-apartheid campaigner Trevor Huddleston. Within six months Masekela got together with some school mates to form the Huddleston Jazz Band. He went on to join Alfred Herbert's African Jazz Revue and the Jazz Epsitles, and played in the orchestra for the hugely successful South African musical \"King Kong,\" whose cast included his future wife, legendary singer Miriam Makeba. Watch Hugh Masekela take CNN on a tour of Johannesburg \u00bb. But South Africa's apartheid laws were making life increasingly difficult. After recording their first record Masekela and The Jazz Epistles were primed for a national tour, but after the Sharpeville Massacre of 1960 the government banned gatherings of more than 10 people, so the tour had to be abandoned. Masekela was determined to further his musical education and moved to London in 1960, studying at the Guildhall School of Music, before leaving for New York, enrolling in the Manhattan School of Music and immersing himself in the city's buzzing jazz scene. After finishing his studies Masekela planned to return to South Africa to teach music, but he found himself cut off from his homeland. \"When I was ready to come back, I couldn't. The place [South Africa] was impenetrable,\" he told CNN. \"By then Mandela had been sentenced to life imprisonment. So I stayed 26 years longer than I planned to.\" Resigned to living in the U.S., Masekela began making a name for himself as a musician, fusing jazz, Latin, African and pop influences in a style all of his own. In 1968 he recorded the breezy instrumental pop tune \"Grazin' in the Grass,\" which gave him a surprise number one hit and became the best-known song of his career. In the 70s he began to divide his time between the U.S. and Africa, living in Guinea, Liberia and Ghana. Incorporating more African influences in his music, he went on to record classics such as \"Home is Where the Music is,\" \"Stimela\" and \"Soweto Blues.\" See Hugh's career in photos. \u00bb . In Botswana he started a music school and set up a mobile recording studio. Nelson Mandela heard about the projects and sent Masekela a birthday message telling him to \"keep up the good work.\" Masekela was so moved that he immediately wrote \"Bring back Nelson Mandela,\" which became an anthem for the anti-apartheid movement. But his vocal opposition to apartheid made him a potential target for South African security forces and he was forced to leave Botswana for London. It was there that he co-wrote the music for hit Broadway musical \"Sarafina!\" Masekela went on to play with Paul Simon on his Graceland tour, along with other South African artists including Ladysmith Black Mambazo and Miriam Makeba. It wasn't until 1990, following the release of Nelson Mandela, that Masekela was finally able to move back to his beloved South Africa. \"It was great, but it was also a tense time coming back to South Africa,\" he told CNN. \"It was a time of real turmoil. There were no-go places in the townships, there was sniping, there were major clashes and it was a time when civil war was threatening.\" Since moving back to Johannesburg, Masekela has continued to record platinum-selling albums and has toured all over the world, but he is also heavily involved in helping his homeland fulfill its potential. Having himself struggled with alcohol and drug abuse in his younger years, Masekela now supports drug-rehabilitation project the Musicians and Artists Assistance Program of South Africa. Another of his projects is to help black Africans own a stake in the country's media outlets. He recently told Al Jazeera, \"TV, broadcasting, manufacturing, management and publishing should be owned by Africans. Until that happens we won't be able to project ourselves, we'll always project from the perspective of those who have exploited us.\" The struggle against apartheid may be over but Masekela is still fighting inequality and hardship, and at 70, he is still a source of inspiration and hope.\n### Response :", "target": "Musician Hugh Masekela was an inspirational campaigner against apartheid .\nHe left South Africa in 1960 to go to music school in London and New York .\nHis hit songs included Grazin' in the Grass\" and \"Bring back Nelson Mandela\"\nHe returned to Jo'burg in 1990 and continues to record and tour the world .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Andrew Cuomo violated the constitutionally mandated three-day review period before a vote was taken \"by unjustifiably issuing a message of necessity.\" -- Lobbyists and the public were shut out from the Senate lobby and \"denied access to elected representatives,\" an act the groups said was unprecedented. \"Today we are asking the court to intervene in its rightful role as the check and balance on an out-of-control state legislature,\" said the Rev. Jason J. McGuire, NYCF's executive director. \"It is unfortunate that state senators chose to protect their personal interests, rather than the people they were elected to represent,\" McGuire said in a statement. \"Some of the players may have changed, but it looks like same old Albany game. It is time the curtain be pulled back and the disinfecting light of good government shine upon the Cuomo administration and our state legislature.\" Numerous calls by CNN to the governor's office and state Senate officials had not been returned Monday evening.\n### Response : ", "target": "Lawsuit claims Marriage Equality Act was illegally made law .\nOpen meeting laws, Senate rules were broken, lawsuit claims .\nLobbyists, public kept away from lawmakers, lawsuit charges .\nNew Yorkers for Constitutional Freedom is the main plaintiff .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?(CNN) -- Every day, we happily entrust more of our lives to automated machines at home and in our cities. But you could be forgiven for blanching at the prospect of a four-armed robot bearing over you, scalpel glinting. But fear not, a human, and a highly-trained one at that, is at the controls of the da Vinci robotic surgical system. \"I think it's very important to explain robotic surgery,\" says David Rosa from da Vinci creators, Intuitive Surgical. \"The robot doesn't do anything on its own. Every movement, all of its controls are controlled by a surgeon who sits at a console.\" The company's tele-operated robots have performed more than 1.5 million operations from abdominal general surgery and gynaecology procedures to thoracic and lung operations. Interactive: Future of printing is 3-D . \"The benefit is minimally invasive surgery. The patient will feel less pain, need less time to recover, generally (lose) less blood depending on the operation. There's just a raft, a whole host of benefits to the patient,\" Rosa said. Three components form the operating core of da Vinci: a patient cart -- which house the robotic arms, the surgeon console and a vision system that provides all the connections, which allow the console and instruments to communicate. Every movement of the surgeon's hand is relayed to the four arms that control up to 50 different instruments, from the basics like scissors and needle drivers to more advanced instrumentation that include electrocautery and staplers. \"When you sit down at da Vinci console, it can do things that you cannot do through other means,\" Rosa says. \"The robotic mechanisms and the 3-D vision that come along with it (means) you can manipulate tissue and perform surgery like no one else can.\" Read/Watch: Future of transport is self-driving cars . Rosa has been with the California-based company from its beginnings in the mid-1990s and has seen the da Vinci system develop from concept to the 10,000-component, $1 million-plus machine it is today. He still remembers the first time he saw it in action. \"I was nervous. There were ten engineers in the room. I remember a few people would joke about me in terms of my gloves being filled with sweat ... but we were all nervous in those days. We had a lot riding on the successful outcomes in terms of continuing to fund the company,\" Rosa said. But anxiety soon turned to optimism as the benefits to patients became clear. Consultant surgeon and chief medical adviser to Intuitive Surgical, Dr Myriam Curet has pioneered the use of the robot in hospitals. \"I spent several months developing a robotic procedure for operating on morbidly obese patients and then we did it on our first patient,\" Curet said. \"Things went extremely well, we were really, really pleased at what it allowed us to do that we couldn't do with traditional methods.\" That said, the system is not without its detractors. Dr Martin Makary -- a senior surgeon at the John Hopkins Medical Institute in Baltimore -- is concerned that many people are not aware of its limitations. \"The Achilles heel of robotic surgery is that the robot cannot feel the tissue, so the surgeon can make an inadvertent injury to a major structure, and that is a unique problem with this kind of surgery,\" he said. \"I'm not anti-robot, but for most of the operations where robotic surgery is used, there's no benefit to the patient. More technology doesn't necessarily mean better quality healthcare.\" However, since making their first sale in 1998 -- to German customers at the Leipzig Heart Center -- the company has sold more than 2,500 robots to hospitals all over the world and reported revenues in excess of $2 billion last year. As for the future, Rosa predicts that surgeons and their patients will be even further apart -- an idea that not so long ago would have seemed like a remote possibility. \"I can imagine being a surgeon in San Francisco and working on a patient in another state, even New York,\" Rosa says.\n### Response: ", "target": "Da Vinci robotic surgery has performed more than 1.5 million operations since late 1990s .\nSurgeon operates robot remotely controlling up to 50 instruments on four robotic arms .\nCalifornia-based company had turnover of $2 billion in 2012 and lead the robot surgery field .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The dead include three in Nepal's capital of Kathmandu, who died when a wall of the British embassy collapsed, according to Kedar Rijal, Kathmandu police chief. They included an 8-year-old girl, her father and a third person. The British Foreign Office confirmed a \"compound perimeter wall\" of the embassy collapsed, adding that its ambassador has met with the community and offered condolences. Police said in a statement that two more people died in the Nepalese town of Dhara, about 217 miles east of Kathmandu. About a dozen people were injured when they jumped from their houses during the quake, police said. On Monday morning, Sikkim's chief secretary Karma Gyatso said that seven people had died in that province, 65 suffered trauma and 33 had minor injuries. Officials in other local governments reported additional fatalities in their provinces, significantly increasing the overall death toll from Sunday. The network said the dead include at least two Indian army personnel. At least two buildings in Sikkim had collapsed and others developed cracks, Gyatso said Sunday. The damage was still being assessed as first-responders and others worked to find and help survivors, he said. A day later, the Sikkim provincial official said that conditions had taken a positive turn. Communications to stricken areas are \"much better\" now,\" said Gyatso, adding cell phone connections have also improved. He added that rescuers have reached most of the hardest-hit areas, with more emergency crews set to be deployed over the course of the day Monday. Already, 300 civilians had been rescued in one such effort near Sikkim's border with China, said Indo-Tibetan Border Police spokesman Deepak Kumar Pandey. Some 22 tourists -- all of them Indians -- were also rescued in the same area. The deaths, damage and recovery efforts came after a total of three quakes struck the region in rapid succession in a mountainous region. The U.S. Geological Survey initially put the largest quake at 6.8 magnitude, later upgrading it to a 6.9, and the other two at magnitudes 4.8 and 4.6. All three occurred within an hour and 15 minutes, the U.S. agency said. The India Meteorological Department said the quakes were 6.8 magnitude, 5.7 magnitude and 5.3 magnitude. The quakes set off landslides, which -- along with heavy rains -- were blocking roads and hampering rescue efforts, Pandey said. He expressed fears that the toll, as far as deaths and damage, could be more than is now known, anticipating more will be known once the sun rises Monday. Already, authorities have reported power outages and downed phone lines in Sikkim. Emergency crews were dispatched from different locations to the region, India's home ministry said in an alert to reporters. At least four fighter jets were carrying rescue officers to a neighboring region, where they travel by road to Gangtok, Sikkim's capital, according to the alert. As for outside help, World Vision announced Sunday that it \"has put its emergency response team in India on standby\" to provide relief as requested. The nonprofit organization reported that the quake cut off phone communication and electricity in parts of Sikkim and West Bengal provinces. \"The whole earth was shaking and it lasted for two minutes,\" Paul Mathai from World Vision, who was 130 kilometers (80 miles) from the epicenter, said in a statement from the organization. \"We were panicked, but all of us are safe.\" No tsunami warning was issued. The strongest earthquake, which struck at 6:10 p.m. local time (8:40 a.m. ET), was 12.2 miles below the earth's surface, according to the USGS.

WSJ's Scott McCartney reports. Photo: AP \n  \n Southwest Airlines Co. failed to perform mandatory rudder inspections on more than 125 jets, or roughly one-fifth of its fleet, forcing it to scramble late Tuesday to negotiate an unusual arrangement with federal regulators to keep the planes flying until the checks were completed. \n  \n The drama began Tuesday afternoon, when the carrier informed the FAA that certain hydraulic inspections were missed on 128 of the company\u2019s Boeing 737-700 models, which were voluntarily taken out of service right away. Some 80 flights were canceled... ||||| Southwest Airlines Co., the world\u2019s biggest operator of Boeing Co. 737 jets, said it will continue flying 128 aircraft while catching up on missed inspections on the planes\u2019 rudders. \n  \n Almost 80 of the Boeing Co. 737-700 checks were completed by midday Wednesday, and the carrier expects to finish all 128 before a five-day deadline set by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, the airline said. The FAA said Southwest could operate the planes, which make up about one-fifth of its fleet, while conducting the reviews. \n  \n Southwest voluntarily grounded the planes for six hours Tuesday after discovering the maintenance lapse and notifying the FAA. The latest problem follows two instances in the last decade in which the Dallas-based airline was fined at least $10 million by the FAA for inadequate inspections or maintenance repairs. \n  \n \u201cThese airplanes have complicated inspection schedules,\u201d said John Hansman, professor of aeronautics and astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cThey go through a series of different progressive checks. It sounds like a tracking error oversight.\u201d \n  \n The missed inspections involve standby hydraulic systems, which serve as the final backup to two primary levels of equipment, and the lowest of three intervals for the checks, the airline said. Each inspection takes about two hours, Southwest said. \n  \n \u201cThis is a periodic inspection of a backup system,\u201d the FAA said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cThe FAA evaluated the risk and agreed that the airline could continue to operate the planes during this short interim.\u201d \n  \n Southwest canceled 80 flights across its network Tuesday because of the missed inspections, said Brandy King, a spokeswoman for the carrier. \n  \n Minimal Impact \n  \n \u201cThe airline is anticipating very minimal impact to their operation as they complete the remaining checks,\u201d King said. \u201cWe only expect around 15 to 19 cancels today as we reposition aircraft.\u201d \n  \n Southwest fell 2.7 percent to $44.12 at the close in New York. The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index declined 2.9 percent. \n  \n Boeing\u2019s twin-engine 737 is the world\u2019s most widely flown jetliner, a workhorse model on short-haul flights like those flown by Southwest. Southwest is the world\u2019s biggest discount carrier and had 665 planes in its all-737 fleet at the end of 2014. \n  \n Under FAA\u2019s policy of overseeing airline safety for the past decade, Southwest probably won\u2019t face an enforcement action or penalty for the lapse. \n  \n Voluntary Reporting \n  \n As part of a broader effort to improve safety as accidents have become increasingly rare and difficult to predict, the agency has begun encouraging pilots and carriers to come forward with safety errors voluntarily. In exchange for that openness, the FAA essentially gives airlines immunity if it finds that they didn\u2019t make errors intentionally and didn\u2019t mislead the agency. \n  \n \u201cThis is the way the system is supposed to work,\u201d John Cox, a former 737 pilot who now heads a safety consulting company, said in an interview. \u201cThey discovered an inadvertent oversight and they brought it to the FAA\u2019s attention.\u201d \n  \n Cox said he never had to use the backup hydraulic system that Southwest failed to inspect during the 15 years he flew the 737. Pilots test it at least once a day to ensure it\u2019s working, so the chances of it causing a safety problem in flight are extremely low, he said. \n  \n While the issue doesn\u2019t appear to have compromised safety, it\u2019s unusual for an airline to miss a mandatory inspection and the FAA will conduct an investigation to determine how the lapse occurred, he said. Cox is president of Washington-based Safety Operating Systems, which does airline safety audits and consulting. \n  \n Stark Contrast \n  \n The latest incident is a stark contrast to Southwest\u2019s failure to perform inspections for fuselage cracks in 2006 and 2007. In that case, Southwest and an FAA manager knew about the missed inspections involving 46 jets used on almost 60,000 flights, and didn\u2019t report them. The issue didn\u2019t come to light until whistle-blowers brought it to congressional investigators. The FAA sought a then-record $10.2 million fine and Southwest later agreed to pay $7.5 million. \n  \n Southwest is opposing a proposed $12 million fine the FAA proposed last year for operating \u201cnumerous flights\u201d in 2009 with inadequate repairs to fuselage skins. The maintenance was designed to eliminate potential cracks on 44 of the airline\u2019s 737s. The repairs were done by a Southwest contractor. \n  \n Also in 2009, Southwest inspected all 181 of one model of 737 for metal weakness after a hole about a foot wide opened in a plane\u2019s fuselage, forcing an emergency landing. No flaws were found, Southwest said at the time. \n  \n A year earlier, the FAA told American Airlines to park its Boeing MD-80s because of what the agency said were maintenance failures that led to chafed wires, misrouted wiring bundles and missing clamps. That incident forced American to cancel 3,300 flights -- and came as the FAA faced criticism over its failure to oversee maintenance at Southwest. |||||\n### Response :", "target": "\u2013 Southwest notified the FAA yesterday of a serious oversight\u2014it failed to conduct a mandatory inspection of some of its planes' rudder systems. Here's the weird part: The inspections still aren't done, but the planes are still flying. The FAA granted the airline an unusual waiver to keep them going for a maximum of five days while the inspections on the Boeing 737-700s are finished, reports the Wall Street Journal. The inspections involve a backup hydraulic system, one that would be used to control the rudder only if the primary system fails.

The F-22 Raptor is the most expensive jet fighter ever built. The plane is the F-22 Raptor, a supersonic stealth marvel that looks like it's flown straight out of a Hollywood action film. It is being built for the U.S. Air Force, boasting the most advanced technology in the sky. \"You talk to any aviator in the world, ask what they would like to fly, and if they don't say the F-22 then they are lying,\" U.S. Major Derek Routt told The Atlantic magazine. \"I would kill to fly it.\" The U.S. government has ordered nearly 200 of them, even as the price has rocketed to more than $350 million each, making the Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 the most expensive fighter ever built. But it's never been used in combat and it's not clear when it will be. The U.S. simply doesn't face any enemies with planes advanced enough to bother sending out an F-22. \"The reality is we are fighting two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" Defense Secretary Robert Gates said, \"and the F-22 has not performed a single mission in either theater.\" Gates doesn't want any more of them. Obama, who campaigned for the presidency criticizing what he considers wasteful military spending, doesn't either. Is the F-22 essential military spending or a waste of money? Sound Off below . But it's the U.S. Congress that actually funds the military. A lot of its members want to see more F-22s taking off, to keep the U.S. air force ahead of potential rivals and protect thousands of factory jobs across the country. \"We need to maintain that air superiority,\" said Congressman Phil Gingrey, whose district is home to the main F-22 assembly line. \"This is not just about 2,200 jobs, although with the economy as it is, and all these job losses, it's kind of preposterous to think that this administration would close (them) down.\" The Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives has voted to order a dozen more planes. But the full Congress would still have to vote and Obama would have to sign the legislation. He says he will veto it instead.

Hansen was Norway's highest-scoring rider as the nation finished third in the Olympic team showjumping. The 29-year-old Hansen was the best performer in a four-rider Norway team which won bronze under a scoring system where the top three count. Without his scores, his teammates -- Morten Djupvik, Stein Endresen, and Geir Gulliksen -- drop out of medal contention. The fourth-placed Switzerland team of Steve Guerdat, Christina Liebherr, Niklaus Schurtenberger and Pius Schwizer will now be awarded the bronze medals by the International Olympic Committee. The United States won gold, beating Canada in a jumpoff in Hong Kong, where the equestrian events were staged last August. Hansen's horse, Camiro, tested positive for capsaicin, a banned pain relieving medication. He was provisionally suspended and did not complete the individual jumping competition. However, he is free to return to competition on January 3 as his suspension was backdated. \"It is each person's duty to ensure that no prohibited substance is present in his or her horse's body during an event,\" said the FEI. Although the drug can be used out-of-competition as a legal medication, it is also classed as a doping substance if used to inflame a horse's legs. This is done to encourage horses to jump higher because striking an obstacle becomes more painful.

Add a splash of corporate sponsorship, and sprinkle in some black-clad, gun-toting security. What you're left with is the World Cup of soccer -- Gaza style. The 16-team, two-week tournament culminated Saturday with the field narrowed down to France and Jordan. The idea for the contest was the brainchild of American aid worker Patrick McGrann and a Palestinian colleague. \"There were a lot of us who were offended that Gaza is not allowed to participate with the rest of the world -- whether it's diplomacy, whether it's schooling, whether it's education or whether it's sports,\" McGrann said. \"So we chose to try and come up with something special. And in this case, a Gaza World Cup. If the rest of the world gets a World Cup, we thought Gaza should get one too.\" While the teams wore the colors of France and Jordan, almost all of the players were Palestinian. Foreign nationals working for the United Nations and other aid organizations rounded out the teams to give it its international flavor. American player Corey Pattison played for the French team. He said they found a way to work past the language barrier. \"When I get out there, it's more like, 'Corey, go forward, go forward, go forward. Don't kick the ball out of bounds,'\" he said. A crowd of several thousand men, along with a few women, watched the two teams battle in a game played down to the proverbial wire. After scoring a goal a piece, the match went into overtime -- with the French besting the Jordanians on penalty shots. The crowd, as expected, went wild. And the jubilation of the players could not be contained. One jumped up on the rail separating the field from the spectators, took off his jersey and led the crowd in a raucous chant. While organizers had hoped to keep politics out of the cup, the politicians could not stay away. Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh presided over the award ceremony. But this was a day for Gazans to put aside politics and their many problems, at least for a while, and bask in the glory of hosting -- and winning -- the World Cup.\n### Response : ", "target": "Palestinians stage 16-team soccer \"World Cup\" in Gaza .\nTeams made up of local players plus international aid workers .\n\"France\" beats \"Jordan\" on penalty kicks in the final .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:I need a summary of the review.(WIRED) -- Following a trend set by other carriers, AT&T has begun sending SMS warning messages to the top 5% of data users on its network. The message alerts consumers that they are among AT&T's top 5% that billing period, and suggests they use Wi-Fi to avoid reduced data speeds in the future. Although it's a pain to those affected, AT&T is being transparent about the issue, giving subscribers a chance to minimize their usage before getting their data speeds choked. Verizon began throttling users who consume a large amount of data, but didn't initially reveal the policy to the public, describe how it would be implemented or describe if and how users would be notified. It should be noted, however, that AT&T was the first carrier to introduce the tiered data plan structure to customers, setting the trend for other carriers to follow suit thereafter. AT&T did away with its unlimited data plan shortly after the iPhone 4 debuted last summer, replacing it with a tiered data structure. Currently, the most robust data option is a $25 per month 2 GB plan that allows you to go over that limit for $10 per extra GB. AT&T confirmed it would throttle the data speeds of the heaviest users on its network in late July. Verizon has a similar policy. The carrier will reduce data speeds \"periodically for the remainder of your then current and immediately following billing cycle\" if you fall within the top 5 percent of heavy data users. This is done in order to \"ensure high quality network performance\" for other users, especially in times and locations where there's peak demand. According to a developer forum, Verizon will call and then send a letter to users who are about to get their data speeds throttled. Verizon eliminated its unlimited data plan in July and now offers 2 GB for $30/month, 5 GB for $50 monthly and 10 GB for $80 monthly. T-Mobile offers an unlimited data plan that costs $100 per month, but throttles users who exceed 5 GB in a single billing cycle. That leaves Sprint as the only carrier that still offers an unlimited data plan without any kind of throttling (unlimited data and minutes for $100/month), but the carrier does tack on a $10 \"Premium Data\" fee for smartphone owners. Sprint is rumored to begin carrying the iPhone this year, which would make it the only carrier to allow users an unlimited data plan with the popular phone. Business analyst and Redditor Zaied Ali was one of the recipients of AT&T's recent round of SMS alerts. He used between 11 and 12 GB of data this month, but normally averages around 6 GB to 7 GB. Ali thinks that AT&T's throttling policy reduces the utility of his smartphone, since he has to think twice about how he uses his phone. \"What is the point of a Netflix app if we don't have the back-end to fully support it?\" Ali says. \"The tiered data plan is in the right direction, but then don't throttle your users. Let them use what they pay for at the speeds that they paid for.\" Another Redditor, Skelatwork, amassed a similar level of data this billing period and received an SMS warning. Skelatwork said that he reached the 11 GB mark by listening to podcasts and Pandora on his commute to work. A Wired.com poll of 11,000 data plan subscribers showed that 73% use less than 2 GB of data each month. Consumer Reports similarly found that the average iPhone user only gobbles 273 MB of data each month. So right now, the throttling issue is generally only affecting a small number of users. As the use of cloud storage and streaming music and video services becomes more widespread, the issue of these data caps and speed throttling is likely to get more heated.

{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given text.(CNN) -- In the end, it was security camera video that made the difference. Yanira Maldonado, an Arizona mother of three children and four stepchildren who spent nine days detained in Mexico under suspicion of smuggling marijuana, was released from a Nogales, Mexico, prison Friday, mainly because of that video. The judge's ruling, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows the surveillance video from a bus terminal and the testimony of three witnesses, were more than sufficient to convince Maria del Carmen Salcedo Garcia, a Mexican federal judge in the border city of Nogales, Mexico; to give Maldonado her freedom back. The prosecution's case, the 29-page document shows, was merely circumstantial. In other words, Maldonado was arrested simply because one of two packages of marijuana discovered on the bus was found under her seat. In the ruling, Salcedo Garcia calls the prosecution's case \"not apt or sufficient to corroborate that Yanira Maldonado ... is the person who transported the narcotics.\" Maldonado, 42, and her husband Gary, 41, were traveling together after attending her aunt's funeral in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, according to the ruling and to interviews conducted with the couple by CNN. They boarded a bus belonging to the Tufesa bus company in the city of Los Mochis on their way back home to the town of Goodyear, outside Phoenix. Their bus was stopped at a military checkpoint May 22 in the town of Querobabi, in the state of Sonora, where three soldiers found two packages containing marijuana, the document says. The drugs, wrapped in clear plastic with \"cinnamon-colored\" tape, weighed 6.003 kilos (13.23 pounds), according to evidence presented in court and referenced in the judge's ruling. It had been originally reported by Mexican authorities the two packages had a combined weight of 5.7 kilograms. Both Yanira and Gary Maldonado were initially detained. Gary Maldonado was later released because neither of the two packages of marijuana was found under his seat. One was found under his wife's seat, number 39. The other was under seat 42, which was unoccupied. The bus driver, identified by the court document as Jorge Luis Flores Grijalva, also was detained. He, too, was released from prison last Friday, just hours before Maldonado. According to the judge's ruling, three witnesses -- the bus driver and two fellow passengers -- testified that the Maldonados boarded the bus in Los Mochis carrying only two blankets and her personal purse. The surveillance video, shown to the court last Thursday at a hearing to which CNN had access, shows, in addition to the blankets and the purse, Yanira Maldonado was carrying two bottles of water and nothing more. In issuing the ruling, Salcedo Garcia said the fact that \"the narcotics in question were found under seat number 39 of bus 323 of the Tufesa Bus Company which was occupied by the defendant does not lead us to conclude in an indisputable way that the drugs were in possession of Yanira Maldonado.\" The judge also sided with defense attorney Francisco Benitez in saying that it would have been impossible for the Maldonados to somehow hide such an amount of drugs while boarding. \"It is illogical and also not credible to believe the packages could've been placed (by the Maldonados) where they were found,\" the judge said, \"without any other passenger on the bus noticing it.\" Speaking to CNN last Wednesday, in her first interview from inside the prison, recorded two days before her release, Maldonado had raised the same objections the judge mentions in her ruling. \"They have cameras in the terminals, on the bus. And they haven't checked that,\" Maldonado told CNN. \"Why don't they check for fingerprints? I don't have my fingerprints on the package.\" A top official in the Mexican state of Sonora said that, so far as the Mexican government is concerned, \"the case is closed.\" The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he's not authorized to speak publicly about the case, said nobody else is expected to be prosecuted. The soldiers who detained the Maldonados \"were only doing their job,\" the official said.\n### Response : ", "target": "Surveillance video from a bus terminal and the testimony of three witnesses carried the day .\nThe prosecution's case was \"not apt or sufficient\" proof, the judge says .\nYanira Maldonado was arrested because a package of marijuana was under her bus seat .\nNobody else is expected to be prosecuted, an official tells CNN .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction: Read the paragraph below, then write a summary of it. (CNN) -- America's enemies must be laughing. But most of the world is just baffled, mystified at the sight of the world's most powerful country tangled in a crippling web of its own making. The government shutdown is weakening the United States before its allies and its foes. It is eroding American standing and prestige while reducing American power and influence. The democracy that once inspired the world now leaves observers perplexed. This, to put it mildly, is not a time when Americans can say they feel pride in their government. It is a time when America's partners worry about how much they can rely on the commitments from a nation that claims to be a bastion of democracy and freedom, not to mention efficiency and competence. For politicians in Washington, and for the American people, angry and frustrated with the increasingly partisan and dysfunctional government, the shutdown that started on Tuesday looks like a battle over domestic politics. For the rest of the world, the closure of U.S. government institutions says America is growing small, small-minded and unreliable. A small band of extreme right-wing politicians couldn't win the debate, or the vote, or the legal argument over health care, so they decided to close down the government instead. A system that allows that to happen is dangerously flawed and in urgent need of repairs. The self-destructive tactic is undermining American strategic interests while the country's rivals make strides on the global stage. While Russia's Vladimir Putin unabashedly strengthens his position, while China expands its global influence, while America faces enormous challenges, the president of the United States and countless top officials are expending energy on a futile exercise. In recent days -- while Syria burned, Iran maneuvered and Europe wondered if the United States will send the global economy back into recession -- U.S. government officials were busy making plans for a shutdown: deciding what offices will be open, what employees would write on their e-mail autoreplies during the shutdown. In the final hours before the deadline, the United Nations General Assembly was in session and Obama was meeting with world leaders. But his mind was presumably on the blackmail and on the impending shutdown. Americans were also distracted, irritated. In a world filled with crises, the ego-massaging spectacle from Washington managed to steal the spotlight. Bravo. American strategic considerations now take a back seat. U.S. efforts to counter China's influence by strengthening ties with Asian countries have to wait. The long-planned visit to Asia by the president was cut in half to attend to this unnecessary crisis. An aide to Supreme Allied Commander in Europe Gen. Philip Breedlove said the general would cut his travel because of the shutdown. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel correctly noted the shutdown would raise doubts among key allies and would damage American credibility. It is impossible to fully calculate the ways in which this hurts America's standing. U.S. officials cooperate on important projects in every field with international organizations. Their partners are learning they cannot rely on them. The United States used to have one of the most respected forms of government on the planet. Washington was never morally crystalline and pure, but enough respect for the principles of democracy made people in other nations yearn to build a similar system, one in which people with differing opinions debated their positions, voted, and accepted the outcome. Who would want to copy the American system now? The last time the government shut down, in 1995, I was in Bosnia. Back then, as we awaited the arrival of NATO forces, we heard of the shutdown. It seemed inconceivable such a thing could happen during a time of crisis. But at least President Clinton and the Republicans led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich were willing to compromise. And they weren't fighting over an issue that had already been triply settled in Congress, in the courts and at the ballot box. And back then the economy was strong, more resilient, better able to withstand the showdown. Today's dogmatic politicians, protected by like-minded zealots in their districts, are looking at their job in the narrowest possible way. They may want to hurt Obama; they may want to blackmail the president into doing away with his health care program. What they are doing is weakening America and its alliances. They are hurting those people in other lands who are trying to make the case that democracy is the best system. From travel agents in Tokyo to newspaper columnists in Britain, people are trying to explain the inexplicable. Tourists from overseas have been blocked from visiting the Statue of Liberty.

{"source": "### Instruction:What's the main idea?London, England (CNN) -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his Conservative rival David Cameron both offered to form an alliance with the minority Liberal Democrats Friday as they jostled for power after an election that failed to create an outright winner. The center-right Conservatives won more seats than Brown's Labour party in Thursday's fiercely-contested vote but lacked the majority needed to form an effective government -- a rare outcome in British politics. Cameron emphasized areas where his party and the Liberal Democrats agreed, including education reform and scrapping plans for national ID cards, while drawing red lines on defense and the economy. He was much vaguer on the Liberal Democrats' greatest ambition -- electoral reform -- that would probably give them more seats in parliament. Cameron said: \"The best thing for Britain now is a new government that works together in that national interest,\" adding that the country needed \"a strong, stable government that lasts.\" Brown said Friday he would be willing to negotiate with any party leader, but said that Cameron and Liberal leader Nick Clegg were \"entitled to take as much time as they feel necessary\" to forge a coalition. \"Should the discussions between Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg come to nothing then I would of course be prepared to discuss with Mr. Clegg the areas where there may be some measure of agreement between our two parties,\" he said. What happens next? Aware of the uncertainty in the UK financial markets about the outcome of the election and how any future government will tackle the country's budget deficit, both Brown and Cameron pledged to work in the \"national interest.\" iReport: Is voting a duty? Clegg indicated he would be willing to talk first to the Conservatives. \"We're in a fluid political situation, \" he said. \"It's vital that all political parties, all political leaders act in the national interest and not out of narrow party political advantage.\" Full election coverage . Official returns Friday showed it would be impossible for any one party to get a majority of seats. The Conservative party came in first, with at least 306 seats in the 650-seat parliament, followed by Brown's Labour party with at least 258. The Liberal Democrats came third, with at least 57. About two dozen seats went to smaller parties. One seat will not be decided until May 27, after the election was delayed due to the death of a candidate. It's very unusual for no party to get an absolute majority of seats in the Commons. The last time it happened, in 1974, voters were back at the polls within months. Hung parliament casts shadow over markets . Several high-profile incumbents lost their seats overnight, including former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, of Labour; and Liberal Democrat Lembit Opik, who had been in parliament for 13 years. All had been implicated in last year's parliamentary expenses scandal. Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson, who has faced questions over land deals and a scandal involving his wife, also lost his seat. The loss of Robinson, head of the Democratic Unionist party, robs the Conservatives of a potential coalition supporter. The Green Party, which favors environmental and social justice policies, gained its first member of parliament when Caroline Lucas was elected in Brighton, in southern England. There were some scenes of voter anger across the country over long lines to cast ballots or polling stations running out of ballot papers, but it was not immediately clear how widespread problems were. Anger at polling stations . \"We will be doing a serious and thorough review of this and making recommendations to parliament and the government,\" Electoral Commission Chairwoman Jenny Watson said. The United Kingdom's system of voting is \"Victorian, antiquated, left over from an era when less people had to vote\" and not designed to cope with mass participation, she said, adding that the system is now \"at breaking point.\" Liberal Democrat leader Clegg expressed his anger after hundreds of voters were turned away from a polling station in his Sheffield constituency. Clegg said Friday he was disappointed that an exuberant election campaign buoyed by his stellar performance in the country's first-ever televised prime ministerial debates had failed to deliver hoped-for results. \"Many many people during the election campaign were excited about the prospect of doing something different, but it seems when they came to vote, many of them decided to stick with what they know,\" he said. The Liberal Democrats' principal policy aim is reform to the electoral system which is currently weighted in favor of Labour and the Conservatives. Under the system, the candidate who receives the most votes in a constituency wins. The system, known as \"first past the post,\" is praised for its simplicity and the strong ties it forms between voters and representatives, but critics dislike its failure to provide proportional representation.

The bill gives the FAA permission to move money from other accounts that allows it to stop furloughing controllers. The FAA issued a statement Saturday saying that it had suspended all employee furloughs and expected normal operations to resume Sunday evening. In rare bipartisan accord, U.S. lawmakers passed the measure Friday, capping a major congressional initiative as the delays snarled airport traffic. Bookkeeping changes . The measure gives the Transportation Department budget planners new flexibility for dealing with forced spending cuts, being allowed to shift money between accounts.

Calderon will attend a meeting with local, state and federal officials, as well as civic and human rights groups, on Wednesday in Ciudad Juarez, which has been plagued by violence stemming from drug cartels. The January 31 killings in southern Juarez of 15 people, most of whom were students with no ties to organized crime, has sparked outrage across the country. The slayings, which occurred at a house party, are thought to be the result of bad intelligence by a cartel and the gang that carried out the killings. President Calderon, who has faced mounting pressure this month from Juarez residents to resign, will be visiting the city for the third time since assuming power in December 2006. Last week in Juarez, Calderon apologized to the families of the 15 people killed and promised residents that their input would form part of the strategy against drug-related violence. Residents of Juarez attempting to highlight the growing frustration with Calderon's war against organized crime took to the streets by the hundreds on Saturday. Many held signs targeted at Calderon reading, \"Assassin.\" On Tuesday, police said a business owner and his 24-year-old secretary were found slain inside a business near southern Juarez at 11 a.m. \"It's not new that the cartels target business owners, but killing his secretary, that's something that you don't see too often,\" Seguro said. Also Tuesday, 20 students found skipping class and drinking in the street were detained by police as part of an effort to curtail unlawful street activity, Seguro said. Violence in Juarez comes amid a backdrop of vastly increased numbers of homicides nationwide, as drug cartels battle each other and the Mexican government steps up its efforts to combat them. The government has not released official figures, but national media say 7,600 Mexicans lost their lives in the war on drugs in 2009. Calderon said last year that 6,500 Mexicans died in drug violence in 2008.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?\n### Input :LONDON, England (CNN) -- As the lights went down in the theater the low murmur built to a thunderous ovation as the odd-looking man in the crumpled suit and bowler hat took to the stage. Tom Waits in Paris on the European leg of his tour. The excitement that greeted the eccentric American singer songwriter Tom Waits' appearance in Edinburgh last month may come as a surprise to the many, who have never heard of him. The 58-year-old has stayed for most of his four-decade career on the edge of the music mainstream. This is despite a showering of critical acclaim and a host of high-profile fans including the movie star Scarlett Johansson, who recently recorded an album of Waits covers. Waits' position on the periphery of pop music (he admits that the 60s scene largely passed him by), may be because he belongs to a bigger historical tradition -- that of the singer-storyteller that has its origin in folk music. His music comes from a different place from most artists. A laconic, bar room philosopher with a wry sense of humor, Waits is an avowed fan of the Beat generation writer Jack Kerouac and the author and poet Charles Bukowski. Many of his songs are stories containing a cast of characters from America's underbelly: the drunks and disenfranchised, the lost souls hiding out from life in seedy night spots. It is the same world that Kerouac chronicled in his writings, including his most famous work \"On the Road,\" which describes a journey across America in the late fifties. Waits, who is notoriously interview-shy, acknowledged his debt to the author in a promotional interview to accompany the release of his 1974 album \"The Heart of Saturday Night.\" He said the record was a search for the \"center of Saturday night,\" a quest he said that Kerouac himself had \"relentlessly chased from one end of this country to the other, and I've attempted to scoop up a few diamonds of this magic that I see.\" Waits' place in the folk tradition is something he has acknowledged, consciously or otherwise, in his music. In 1990, he wrote the music and lyrics for \"The Black Rider: The Casting of the Magic Bullets,\" a theatrical collaboration with the American writer William Burroughs based on a German folktale. Like all great writers, Waits is a conscientious observer of people and their strange foibles. Born in Pomona, CA. he moved to Los Angeles in the late sixties to pursue his music career, finding work as a doorman at an LA nightspot. It was at this time that he honed his skills as a storyteller, eavesdropping on the lives of others. \"I was picking up people's conversations in all-night coffee shops - ambulance drivers, cabdrivers, street sweepers,\" he said in an interview with The New Yorker. \"I did research there as an evening curator, and I started writing gingerly. I thought at some point I'd like to forge it all into something meaningful, and give it dignity.\" The results of this labor are songs like \"Frank's Wild Years,\" a hilarious and sinister tale of a man -- Frank -- trapped in suburbia with a wife and pet dog that has a skin disease. The song is spoken in a lounge room style over a soft jazz accompaniment, and like much of Waits' work it drips irony: \"They had a thoroughly modern kitchen/ Self-cleaning oven (the whole bit)/ Frank drove a little sedan/ They were so happy.\" In a 1983 promotional interview published by his then record company Island, Waits credits a short story by Bukowski with giving him some of the inspiration for the song. \"Bukowski had a story that essentially was saying that it's the little things that drive men mad,\" Waits said. \"It's not World War II. It's the broken shoe lace when there is no time left that sends men completely out of their minds. \"I think there is a little bit of Frank in everybody.\" In the song, Frank eventually runs amok, setting fire to the family home and blazing a trail up the Hollywood freeway because, as Waits quips in the pay-off \"he never could stand that dog.\" This taste for the absurd carried into his recent live show with the set for the \"Glitter and Doom\" tour decked in a bizarre array of old speaker cones. Waits took to the stage dressed in a Chaplinesque suit, delivering his set from a slightly raised platform that gave up a cloud of dust each time he bashed his feet into it. In spite of the entreaties from the crowd he kept quiet between songs at first. Eventually after a few numbers he broke his silence. \"This is a lopsided love song,\" he rasped, introducing the next track. \"By that I mean the person doing it is lopsided, not the song itself.\" Lopsided or not, it's an authentic voice we could surely do with hearing more from.\n### Response : ", "target": "Singer songwriter Tom Waits has won critical acclaim for his music .\nHis strange tales of the seedy side of America have attracted a cult following .\nThe actress Scarlett Johansson is a fan and recorded a recent tribute album .\nWaits counts U.S. writers Jack Kerouac and Charles Bukowski as influences .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?(CNN) -- A quick look at Japan's nuclear industry and the problems faced at three plants since Friday's massive earthquake off northern Honshu, as compiled by the CNN Wire: . NATIONWIDE . Japan's electric power companies run 54 nuclear reactors, with two under construction, at 17 power plants, according to figures from the International Atomic Energy, the U.N. nuclear watchdog. They produced more than 280,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2010 -- about 30 percent of Japan's total electricity generation. Most Japanese plants -- including the three facing emergencies since the earthquake -- use boiling-water reactors, in which water circulated through the reactor is converted to steam and used to drive a generator. Most U.S. reactors and about 40 percent of Japan's are pressurized-water reactors, in which reactor coolant is kept separate from the steam used to drive generators. Both types are far different than the Soviet design involved in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, a reactor model now considered unsafe by the international nuclear industry. In addition, the Chernobyl plant lacked the kind of reinforced steel-and-concrete containment structure that U.S. and Japanese regulators require. Tokyo Electric Power Company is the largest of the nine utilities that operate Japan's nuclear plants and runs the two plants affected by Friday's quake. In 2002, its president, vice president and chairman resigned after a scandal in which TEPCO was accused of falsifying safety repair records in 29 cases. The company instituted reforms in September 2002 in an attempt to restore public confidence. FUKUSHIMA DAIICHI . The plant with the worst reported problems is TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi, about 65 km (40 miles) south of Sendai. Three of the plant's six reactors had already been shut down for inspection at the time of the quake, but two of the three that were in service at the time have been damaged, the utility said. An explosion caused by hydrogen buildup Saturday blew the roof off the No. 1 reactor's containment structure and injured four workers, but the reactor was not reported to have sustained damage. Workers have been pouring a mixture of seawater and boron into the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors in what experts have called a last-ditch attempt to prevent a meltdown -- a catastrophic failure of the reactor core, with a potential for widespread radiation release. Japanese nuclear regulators have said there is a \"possibility\" that at least a partial meltdown already has occurred in the reactors. The government has evacuated more than 200,000 residents from homes within a 20-km (12.5-mile) radius of the plant and tested 160 people for radiation exposure, authorities said Sunday. The six units at Fukushima Daiichi went into service between 1970 and 1979. FUKUSHIMA DAINI . Japanese authorities have detected cooling-system problems at TEPCO's Fukushima Daini plant, but have not expressed any concerns about possible meltdowns there. Nevertheless, those living within a 10-km radius of Fukushima Daini were ordered to evacuate as a precaution. TEPCO reported that cooling systems the three operational units at Fukushima Daini failed after the quake, but the IAEA, citing Japanese authorities, reported that all three had power Sunday afternoon. TEPCO reported one fatality at the plant. A crane operator who had been trapped at an operating console in the plant's exhaust stack was pronounced dead Saturday, the company reported. Fukushima Daini is about 80 km south of Sendai. The plant's four reactors went online between 1981 and 1987. ONAGAWA . Japanese officials declared an emergency Sunday at the Onagawa nuclear plant after finding radiation levels above allowed levels in the surrounding area. However, radiation levels had dropped to normal levels by early Monday, and the \"current assumption\" of Japanese authorities is that the increased radiation levels may have been caused by material released from Fukushima Daiichi, according to the IAEA. The plant reported smoke in a turbine house after Friday's earthquake, but Japan has told the IAEA that the three reactors at Onagawa are under control. Onagawa is about 70 km north of Sendai. It is owned by the Tohoku Electric Company, and its three reactors entered service between 1983 and 2001. Reactor No. 2 was shut down for a five-month inspection in November, according to the company.\n### Response : ", "target": "Japan's electric power companies run 54 nuclear reactors at 17 power plants .\nThey produced more than 280,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity in 2010 .\nMost Japanese plants -- including the three facing emergencies -- use boiling-water reactors .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Free tickets to Tuesday's memorial service for Michael Jackson have appeared for sale online. Dozens of listings selling vouchers for Jackson tickets appeared Monday on auction site eBay and Craigslist, the classified ads site, prompting complaints from Jackson fans and others who felt the sales were inappropriate. \"You people trying to sell these tickets should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves,\" said a Craigslist user in a post Monday morning. \"Please flag all of these money-grabbing opportunists...if you're a true MJ fan you won't give money to these parasites.\" Organizers of the public memorial service, scheduled for Tuesday morning at the Staples Center arena in downtown Los Angeles, made 8,750 pairs of tickets available through an online lottery. But demand far outstripped supply, as about 1.6 million fans registered for a chance at the tickets. Winners received an e-mail Sunday directing them to print vouchers and bring them Monday to Dodgers Stadium, where they were to receive tickets and have a nonremovable wristband placed on their arms. Those entering the Staples Center on Tuesday must have wristbands to match their tickets. But that didn't stop some people from trying to sell their vouchers to anyone who could make it to Dodgers Stadium by 7 p.m. Monday. One pair of tickets attracted a bid of $275,000 on eBay before the listing was removed. It was difficult to tell whether the offer was serious. Both eBay and Craigslist took steps Monday to thwart the ticket sellers. \"eBay will not allow Michael Jackson memorial service tickets to be listed on the site,\" the company said in a statement. \"If found, eBay will remove them from the site immediately.\" By Monday afternoon the number of listings for \"Michael Jackson memorial tickets\" on eBay had dropped to a handful, and the site was removing them shortly after they appeared.  Learn more about plans for the memorial \u00bb . Craigslist allows its users to flag ads they find inappropriate, and ads receiving enough negative flags are automatically removed from the site. Many ads proffering Jackson memorial tickets were removed shortly after they were posted Monday. Among those was a listing posted by a man who identified himself only as Peetey, 29, of Venice Beach, California. He was asking $8,000 for a single ticket; the winning bidder would accompany his girlfriend to the service, he said. The ad was removed within 15 minutes, he said, but that was enough time for five people to call with interest. When contacted by CNN, Peetey said he sees nothing wrong with selling a free ticket to a memorial service. \"We live in a capitalist society where money is what really speaks,\" he said. \"I'm not trying to make a huge profit. I'm not trying to take advantage of anybody.\" Peetey, who did not want his last name used for fear of backlash from Jackson fans, said he would go to the memorial service if he can't get at least $5,000 for the ticket. His girlfriend won the lottery-issued tickets, he said, and will attend the event. \"I want to go, and I have a large desire to go, but if I can get a lot of money, especially in this economic climate, it doesn't seem wise for me to sit there for two hours if I can get $10,000 for the ticket,\" he said. Daniel Moreno, 33, of Murrieta, California, said people trying to sell the tickets are disgracing Jackson by trying to capitalize on his death. \"That kind of sucks, you know. The guy's dead,\" said Moreno, who posted a statement on Craigslist vowing to flag any listings selling Jackson memorial tickets. Moreno said those with tickets should give them away if they don't want to attend the service. \"I don't have $1,000 to spend on this ticket and wouldn't want to spend $1,000 on this ticket,\" he told CNN. \"And I wouldn't want to be in the presence of someone who's trying to sell the ticket because I'd be arrested for battery.\"  By 2 p.m. (5 p.m. ET), organizers had handed out more than 6,400 pairs of tickets.

The assault Saturday by hundreds guerrillas on the convoy of Congress politicians in a forested area of the eastern state of Chhattisgarh killed at least 24 people and wounded 33, according to authorities. Among the dead was Mahendra Karma, a top local party leader and the founder of a controversial anti-Maoist militia named Salwa Judam, or the Purification Hunt. His stance against the insurgents appears to have prompted them to take a vicious approach when they captured him. They fired 30 to 40 bullets into Karma's body and smashed his head with the butt of their guns after killing him, said Ram Niwas, the state police chief. \"He was beaten brutally even after his death,\" he said. Niwas said as many as 500 insurgents had participated in the attack. Police had previously estimated that around 200 attackers had raided the convoy. At least 16 cars in the motorcade of local Congress leaders were passing through the area when the insurgents set off a land mine and opened fire on them, police said. Among the dead were eight policemen, three laborers and some car drivers. Searching for suspects . Authorities haven't reported any arrests so far, but investigations are under way. Security forces are combing the area where the raid took place, Niwas said Monday. A judicial inquiry has been ordered into Saturday's assault. If any failings on the part of the police are found, \"appropriate action will be taken,\" Niwas said when asked about his response to criticism of security in the area. On Sunday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh visited a hospital in Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh, where some of those wounded in the attack were being treated. He was accompanied by the Congress party chief, Sonia Gandhi. \"We will pursue the perpetrators of this crime with urgency, and I can assure the nation that the government is committed to bringing them to justice,\" Singh said. India's internal threat . Saturday's severe attack came barely three days after Singh announced what he called a significant decline in killings by left-wing insurgents, whom the federal government describes as the nation's gravest internal security threat. \"The quantum of violence as well as the resultant killings perpetrated by the left-wing extremist groups in 2012 declined significantly for the second successive year,\" said a report Singh released on Wednesday to mark the fourth anniversary of his second term in office. He insisted his government has continued to provide public infrastructure and services in tribal districts hit by Maoist extremism. The rebels, officials say, aim to seize power through an armed struggle. Since the 1960s, the militants have said they are fighting for the dispossessed. Authorities suspect that the Maoists enjoy support not only in the poorest areas and in tribal communities but also among young people and intellectuals. In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people they call \"class enemies,\" the insurgents also are believed to have attacked infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks.\n### Response: ", "target": "Most people in the convoy attacked by Maoists were from India's Congress party .\nAmong the 24 people killed is the founder of an anti-Maoist militia .\nThe insurgents smashed his head with the butt of their guns, police say .\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh visits the wounded, vows to find culprits .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

They're also trying to stifle the widespread criticism of the attack in the news media by threatening journalists in Pakistan. The militant group's menacing statements have intensified fears among reporters in a country that is already one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist.

The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the act, but they didn't appear to have anticipated the level of revulsion and condemnation that it would provoke. Thousands of people joined in rallies across Pakistan in support of the wounded teen, and calls grew for a strong response from the government. As coverage of the shooting -- and the appalled reaction to it -- swept across the Pakistani and international news media, the Taliban began issuing lengthy statements trying to justify the targeting of Malala, who had defied them by insisting on the right of girls to go to school. They also complained that \"this filthy, godless media has taken huge advantage of this situation, and journalists have started passing judgment on us,\" raising the prospect of killing those journalists.

Reporters in northwestern Pakistan, the region where the Taliban are active, say they have been alerted by authorities of an increased risk to their security and some of them have received warnings that they are being specifically targeted. \"Things after Malala have become more tense, as the Taliban is very angry with the way the attack was reported,\" said a veteran journalist in Peshawar, the main city in the restive northwestern region near the border with Afghanistan. \"We are scared, but what can we do? We have to work.\" The journalist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisals, noted that factions of the Taliban had killed and abducted other journalists in the past because they were unhappy with their coverage. Tanvir Ahmed Tahir, the executive director of the All Pakistan Newspapers Society, a trade body of publishers, said the organization had requested extra security from the government to protect its members' operations and staff in light of the Taliban statements. The militants' threats against journalists for covering an attack for which they had unabashedly claimed responsibility may seem contradictory. But it goes to the heart of the Taliban's approach, according to Mustafa Qadri, Pakistan researcher for the human rights group Amnesty International. Attack on Pakistani schoolgirl galvanises anti-Taliban feeling . \"The underlying thing to understand is the Taliban only have one modus operandi: violence,\" said Qadri, who is based in Britain but travels to Pakistan regularly. \"They use it to intimidate people and coerce them into doing what they want.\" He said that some of the local journalists he had spoken to in northwestern Pakistan -- including in Mingora, the main town in the Swat Valley where Malala's family lives -- were \"very shaken\" by the Taliban threats and had asked him to pray for them. \"These people have families and children,\" he said. \"Part of their job is going out into the field -- they don't have luxury of leaving the country\" like foreign journalists. Despite the risks, the Malala story is still \"actively being taken up by the press\" and journalists are \"doing their duty,\" Tahir of the newspaper society said. That role is all the more significant in a part of the world caught amid various geopolitical riptides. The volatile area southwest of Peshawar, along the porous border between Pakistan and Afghanistan, is a base for extremist groups, the focus of the controversial U.S. drone strike program and the scene of clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants. Malala: A global symbol but still just a kid . Much of it has become a no-go area for reporters, especially those from Western news organizations, but some local journalists still venture into risky areas. \"If we don't have these people doing this job, we won't know what's happening,\" said Qadri. \"When conflicts are fought away from the media lens, that increases the scope for abuses.\" The dangers that journalists already face in Pakistan are well documented. More journalists were killed there than in any other country in both 2010 and 2011, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a group based in New York that promotes press freedom around the world. \"Many of those who died in targeted killings had first been warned to be silent,\" the group said in a blog post on its website. Threats can come not just from militants, but also from government agencies, the CPJ said. \"It's really tough being a journalist in Pakistan, especially on the front line where they are under constant pressure from the Taliban, the state and even political parties,\" said Qadri, who worked as a reporter in the country for four years. \"It's a very politicized environment.\" Pakistani teen inspires others to fight for education .\n### Response:", "target": "\"We are scared, but what can we do?\" a Pakistani reporter says .\nThe Taliban have threatened journalists following the shooting of Malala .\nThey say the journalists are \"passing judgment\" on them .\nPakistan is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a reporter .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

YouTube was blocked in China as of Wednesday. Google, which owns YouTube, said it began noticing a decline in traffic from China about noon Monday. By early Wednesday, site users insider China continued to encounter an error message: \"Network Timeout. The server at youtube.com is taking too long to respond.\" \"We do not know the reason for the blockage and we are working as quickly as possible to restore access to our users,\" said Scott Rubin, a spokesman for Google, which owns YouTube. It's not the first time users in China have been unable to access the site. In March 2008, China blocked YouTube during riots in Tibet.  Watch more about the decision \u00bb . At the time, protesters burned vehicles and shops, some advocating independence from China, and others demonstrating against the growing influence of the Han Chinese in the area. The subsequent crackdown left 18 civilians and one police officer dead, according to the Chinese government. Tibet's self-proclaimed government-in-exile put the death toll from the protests at 140. Many in the country speculated the latest ban may be an attempt to filter access to footage that a Tibetan exile group released. The videos show Tibetans being kicked and beaten, allegedly by Chinese police officers after the riots. \"Though there is much footage of the protests taking place throughout Tibet last year that were splashed across the world, the following is rare footage of police beating of protesters, the suffering and death of a captive, and paramilitary presence in Lhasa (the Tibetan capital), which managed to make its way to the outside world,\" the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India, said of the videos. Xinhua, China's state news agency, accused the supporters of Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, of doctoring the video to \"deceive the international community.\" China, with 298 million Internet users, has routinely blocked access to Web sites it considers politically unacceptable, including the Voice of America and The New York Times. The Chinese government has also censored television broadcasts, including those by the BBC and CNN, during coverage of issues such as its policy in Tibet and Taiwan. The Chinese government did not directly address whether it has blocked YouTube. \"China is not afraid of the Internet,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang on Tuesday. \"We manage the Internet according to law ... to prevent the spread of harmful information.\" YouTube, which allows users to upload and share videos, has been banned periodically in other countries as well. Bangladesh, Pakistan, Thailand and Turkey temporarily shut off access to the site after users uploaded content the countries' governments considered politically embarrassing.

{"source": "### Instruction:Provide a short summary of the story.Washington (CNN) -- Nearly 180 Department of Homeland Security weapons were lost -- some falling into the hands of criminals -- after officers left them in restrooms, vehicles and other public places, according to an inspector general report. The officers, with Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \"did not always sufficiently safeguard their firearms and, as a result, lost a significant number of firearms\" between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2008, the report said. In all, 243 firearms were lost in both agencies during that period, according to the January report from Inspector General Richard Skinner. Of those, 36 were lost because of circumstances beyond officers' control -- for instance, ICE lost a firearm during an assault on an officer. Another 28 were lost even though officers had stored them in lockboxes or safes. But 74 percent, or 179 guns, were lost \"because officers did not properly secure them,\" the report said. Following a review of the draft report in December, Homeland Security took steps to implement its recommendations and overhaul its property management policy, according to a response in the report. A department spokeswoman did not immediately return a call from CNN Thursday seeking comment. The report concluded the department did not have specific procedures and policies in place regarding firearms. \"Instead, DHS relied on its components to augment its general property management policies and procedures with specific guidance for safeguarding and controlling firearms,\" it said. \"Although some component policies and procedures for safeguarding firearms were sufficient, personnel did not always follow them.\" The inspector general cited several examples of \"inappropriate practices.\" A customs officer, for instance, left a firearm in an idling vehicle in the parking lot of a convenience store. The vehicle was stolen while the officer was inside. \"A local law enforcement officer later recovered the firearm from a suspected gang member and drug smuggler,\" the report said. In addition, an ICE officer left an M-4 rifle and a shotgun unsecured in a closet at his home. Both weapons were stolen in a burglary and later recovered from a felon, according to the report. Another officer left his firearm in the restroom of a fast-food restaurant, and it was gone when he returned. \"Other CBP and ICE officers left firearms in places such as a fast food restaurant parking lot, a bowling alley and a clothing store,\" the report said. \"Although our review focused on CBP and ICE, other components described similar incidents. For example, a TSA officer left a firearm in a lunch box on the front seat of an unlocked vehicle; the officer realized the firearm was stolen when he returned to the vehicle two days later,\" said the report. \"Officers may have prevented many of these losses had they exercised reasonable care when storing their weapons.\" Of the 179 lost because of laxity, 120 were reported stolen and 59 as lost, the report said. That resulted from the agencies' lack of guidance on a standard method for classifying and reporting lost firearms, as well as \"a common perception among officers that reporting a stolen firearm was more acceptable than reporting a lost firearm. \"Although CBP and ICE reported 120 firearms as stolen, our analysis showed that these firearms were lost (stolen) because officers left the firearms unsecured,\" according to the report. \"All 179 losses may have been prevented had the officers properly secured their firearms.\" The department had about 188,500 weapons in its inventory as of last summer, the report said. The majority are assigned to Customs and Border Protection and ICE officers, but others are carried by agencies including the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.\n### Response: ", "target": "Customs, ICE officers \"did not always sufficiently safeguard their firearms,\" report says .\nOf 243 guns, 179 were lost \"because officers did not properly secure them\"\nGuns were left in unlocked cars, fast food restaurants, bowling alleys .\nHomeland Security responds by overhauling property management policy .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

CNN obtained copies of letters LaHood sent to incoming Republican governors in Ohio and Wisconsin who have stated their opposition to rail projects already underway in their states. In the letters, LaHood said a rail link between Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati in Ohio, and a high-speed rail connection between Chicago, Illinois, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, are vital to economic growth in both regions. Lahood wrote that he respects the power of governors to make decisions for their states, but, \"There seems to be some confusion about how these high-speed rail dollars can be spent.\" To Wisconsin's Gov.-elect Scott Walker, LaHood said that none of the funds can be used for roads or any other projects. He went on to say, \"Consequently, unless you change your position, we plan to engage in an orderly transition to wind down Wisconsin's project so that we do not waste taxpayer's money.\" That letter was delivered on Monday. A similar letter was sent to Gov.-elect John Kasich in Ohio on Tuesday. In that letter, LaHood mentions the thousands of jobs that would be created with the construction of a rail link between the state's largest cities. LaHood said he was aware that Kasich had asked President Barack Obama if $400 million dollars from the federal government intended to fund the passenger rail project could instead be used for road construction and freight lines. LaHood wrote, \"I wanted to let you know that none of those funds can be used for anything other than our High-Speed Rail Program,\" and he signaled his intention to take the money back if the project doesn't move forward. The Transportation Department has committed a total of $823 million to a 441-mile-long high-speed rail connection from Chicago to Minneapolis. But if Wisconsin balks on the section that would run between Milwaukee and Madison, the project can not be completed. Similarly, the DOT committed $400 million to a 250-mile-long intercity passenger rail line that would run from Cincinnati, through Dayton and Columbus, and on to Cleveland. The Transportation Secretary is in a fight to keep several proposed high-speed rail projects alive after New Jersey's Republican Gov. Chris Christie abruptly killed the nation's largest infrastructure project last month. The ARC Tunnel would have involved the construction of a second rail tunnel between New Jersey and New York and an expansion of Penn Station in New York City. It was expected to double commuter rail capacity on the Northeast Corridor, the nation's busiest rail line, and ease congestion on New Jersey's highways. Now the feds want their money back from New Jersey. On Monday, a letter was sent from the Federal Transit Administration to New Jersey Transit, the state's public transportation authority, requesting an immediate repayment of $271 million in federal funds already spent on the project. The letter stated the funds were obligated for the ARC tunnel and because the project was terminated, the money most be returned. New Jersey Transit officials responded by saying they are reviewing the request and they do not agree that the issue is as clear-cut as portrayed in the FTA letter. Christie put an end to the tunnel, claiming that potential cost overruns could range from $2 billion to $5 billion, something the cash-strapped state can not afford. But USDOT officials believe any cost overruns on ARC wouldn't have exceeded $800 million.\n### Response :", "target": "Governors-elect in Ohio and Wisconsin got letters from the transportation secretary .\nThe governors have stated objections to rail projects in their states .\nRay HaHood's letter tells the governors they must proceed with the rail projects .\nOr return federal stimulus funds designated for high-speed rail projects .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction :How would you encapsulate this?Washington (CNN) -- The once ragtag Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate group known as Al-Shabaab has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash every year from a variety of schemes involving extortion, illegal taxation and other \"fees,\" according to a United Nations report. The United States believes the group is closely coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and may be plotting attacks in the region and abroad. The terrorist group now \"generates between $70 million and $100 million per year, from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports, taxes on goods and services, taxes in kind on domestic produce, 'jihad contributions,' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation,\" according to the July 18 report from the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. The group has a long history of hindering humanitarian aid deliveries to millions suffering from drought and famine. In recent months, the U.S. military and the CIA have stepped up covert operations inside Somalia in an effort to counter the growing Al-Shabaab capabilities. One U.S. official says there are now estimates that Al-Shabaab controls up to 1,000 fighters in the country. He declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the information. \"I would say that the greatest risks right now in East Africa are Al-Shabaab and the violent extremists that they represent,\" says General Carter Ham, commander of the U.S. Africa Command. Speaking to his own troops recently, Ham said: \"Even if you don't think the humanitarian need is compelling enough ... to me there is a security angle to this which affords us an opportunity as a nation, as a collective group of nations, to really take an effort to undermine what Al-Shabaab is trying to do in Somalia.\" The Al-Shabaab organization \"presents an increasingly acute regional and international threat,\" according to the U.N. report. The monitoring group says despite infighting and some military defeats, \"the economic health of Al-Shabaab is more robust than ever.\" Funds are being used to pay for fighters, weapons and ammunition and continued fighting against the fragile Somalia security forces and African Union troops in the country. \"Al-Shabaab is evolving from an armed faction into a lucrative consortium of business interests, both within Somalia and abroad, whose members benefit from cartel-style trading practices, tax breaks and mutual facilitation. Moreover, there are indications that Al-Shabaab trading networks may also be used to camouflage charitable contributions from sympathizers in the Gulf States,\" the report reads. Al-Shabaab's economic growth has emerged largely since October 2009 when it won control of the southern port town of Kismaayo and other nearby ports. The group now generates an estimated $35 million to $50 million a year from port revenues. Another $30 million to $60 million a year comes from \"taxes\" on businessmen operating in marketplaces in the capitol of Mogadishu and other towns. \"In addition to those taxes on businesses, Al-Shabaab operates a comprehensive web of mobile military checkpoints where transportation operators and passengers are all obliged to pay taxes for free passage,\" the report reads. The U.N. report offers extensive details on Al-Shabaab's arms smuggling operations, as well as what the U.N. says are credible reports of potentially illegal arms shipments coming in by air and sea into southern Somalia and then being shipped to fighters throughout the country. \"During the Ramadan offensive in August and September 2010, for instance, several lorry loads of arms and ammunition arrived in Mogadishu just days after a consignment of weapons reportedly landed at Kismaayo airport,\" it reads.

{"source": "### Instruction :What's the text mainly about?Turkish riot police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse thousands of mourners who attended a funeral march Wednesday for a 15-year old boy. Throughout the afternoon, a virtual river of humanity coursed through the streets of Istanbul escorting the coffin of Berkin Elvan. Mourners carrying portraits of the boy and red carnations chanted \"Berkin Elvan, a sapling just 15 years old.\" \"The boy was innocent.  The boy wasn't doing anything.  He went to get bread and the police took a shot at him and basically killed him,\" said Dursun Ince, a retired engineer who was one of tens of thousands of demonstrators who participated in the march. Berkin Elvan's death unleashed a wave of grief and rage against the Turkish government that sparked protests in cities across the country. Public messages of condolence issued by Turkey's family affairs minister, as well as a sympathetic phone call from the Turkish President to the father of the boy, did little to calm the outrage. Elvan's mother, Gulsum, has placed blame for the critical injury her son suffered last June squarely on the government and police. The boy was 14 years old when he was last seen conscious stepping out of his home to buy bread for his family's breakfast.  His family says he was next seen 15 minutes later suffering from a horrendous head wound believed to have been inflicted by a tear gas canister fired by Turkish police. For the next nine months, the teenager lay in a coma, wasting away to a weight of just 16 kilograms (35 pounds). Elvan was pronounced dead early Tuesday morning. That night, demonstrators hurled stones, bottles and abuse at Turkish riot police in several Istanbul neighborhoods. \"Killers!\" angry crowds screamed at helmeted police officers on Istanbul's Istiklal Caddesi. \"You killed Berkin Elvan!\" a woman yelled. After initially holding back, squads of riot police began pursuing demonstrators through the streets. Armored personnel carriers patrolled main boulevards, hosing rioting youths with water cannons, which were also periodically used to extinguish burning barricades. On Wednesday, a major labor union called for a nationwide strike in honor of the dead boy. Several of the main opposition political parties, which are in the middle of fierce campaigns ahead of nationwide municipal elections on March 30, announced they would not play music at rallies Wednesday. Turkish television also aired footage of university students in a canteen, banging their silverware on tables in a show of support for the Elvan family. Some high school and university student groups are calling for a boycott of classes Wednesday. \"A small kid is murdered and the killers are still loose. This is us standing up for our kid brother,\" said Bircan Birol, a 22-year-old member of the Student Collectives movement at Istanbul University.  \"There are pictures of Berkin up everywhere, and today we say: 'Our class is Berkin Elvan.' \" Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's fiery Prime Minister, has yet to mention the Elvan family in any of his daily campaign rallies. Erdogan is fighting hard to mobilize his ruling Justice and Development Party to continue its decade-long electoral winning streak in this month's municipal elections. However, Abdullah Gul, the man who holds the largely symbolic post of Turkish President, personally called the grieving family Monday. \"The family was very grateful for the call. They asked (for) Mr President's help in finding out the security cam recordings of the incident, which, interestingly, couldn't be found so far,\" an official in Abdullah Gul's office wrote CNN in an e-mail, on condition of anonymity because of Turkish protocol. \"And they asked the help of Mr President for calm during the funeral -- and especially that the police shall not intervene. The President told them that he will talk to the governor especially to provide a smooth, calm and respectful funeral without any more bad scenes.\" There was little to no visible police presence escorting the funeral procession on Wednesday.  But as the sun began to set in Istanbul, police riot control vehicles began hosing down throngs of demonstrators with water cannons, sending thousands of people sprinting to escape clouds of tear gas.

{"source": "### Instruction:In this task, you are asked to generate a summary for the given review.\n### Input: (CNN) -- There aren't too many times when I'm speechless about what I consider an outrageous example of parenting. This is one of those times. An Instagram photo surfaced over the weekend of a child wearing a Ray Rice costume and dragging a doll ostensibly meant to symbolize the wife of the embattled former NFL star, Janay Rice. (The person who posted the photo with the caption \"Greatest costume ever\" appears to have since taken down their Instagram account.) As most of us sadly know by now from the surveillance video that has been seen around the world, Rice dragged his then-fiancee out of an elevator after knocking her out in February. And so a kids' costume of Rice dragging his wife? Are you kidding me? Thankfully, some parents across the country have the words I can't seem to find. Halloween costumes to avoid this year . \"Utterly disgusting!\" is what Mike Heenan, a father of two young daughters and organizer of the SF Dads Group, called \"the seemingly celebratory suggestion of domestic violence in dragging around a Janay Rice doll.\" \"Not just insensitive. Idiotic! Dangerous! Disgraceful!\" said Heenan, who is also the founder of the blog At-Home Dad Matters. On Facebook, Alison Bucalo, a mom of two boys in Ridgewood, New Jersey, said she would never let her little guys wear something \"so tasteless.\" \"What's the purpose? To be funny? To shock? To show zero class? What is the lesson here?\" she asked. This Ray Rice costume for kids is just the latest example of what seems to be a trend in wildly inappropriate children's Halloween costumes, with selections ranging from meth dealers Walter White and Jesse Pinkman from TV's \"Breaking Bad\" to a baby cigarette to serial killer Hannibal Lecter. 5 scary good healthy Halloween treats . On the video-sharing site for tweens called KidzVuz, a girl who goes by the name \"citykid\" was horrified to see costumes such as a \"terrorist\" and a \"little Hitler.\" \"People actually made these for their kids to wear,\" she said incredulously. \"Just because it's Halloween that doesn't mean you can cross these kinds of lines.\" Well said, citykid. She also pointed out the growing popularity of oversexualized costumes for our girls. \"By making these costumes manufacturers are encouraging tween girls to dress twice their age.\" Melissa Atkins Wardy, a mom of two and author of \"Redefining Girly,\" said it is \"especially concerning\" when hypersexualized costumes \"dominate the girls market.\" Pink, princess-y and sexy too soon . \"It reflects a litmus test of our society and conveys the message to girls they are valued for their looks,\" said Wardy, who is also the founder and chief executive officer of PigtailPals & Ballcap Buddies, which offers empowering T-shirts for girls and boys. \"Instead of dressing like a true fire fighter/super hero/doctor/bug/witch, they face row after row of the sexy version of those things, size 5T,\" Wardy said. \"While a little girl may not understand what 'sexy' is, the older children and adults around her certainly do, and it impacts the way we talk to and respond to girls.\" Pam Moore, host of the blog Whatevs, said she's seen costumes such as a \"sexy mermaid\" or a \"sexy Starbucks beverage\" for children on Pinterest. \"Basically, anything that could be described as 'sexy' is inappropriate for a young girl,\" said Moore, who blogs about motherhood, fitness, home birth and life in Boulder, Colorado. As for how a parent can draw the line between what's inappropriate and what's OK for children to wear on Halloween, Moore, in my humble opinion, had some great advice. \"I would ask myself if this costume is getting a laugh at anyone's expense.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you outline the content?Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Two hostages freed by a Colombian rebel group reunited with their family members in the country's capital Friday. Speaking to reporters, one of the freed hostages called for renewed dialogue between the government and insurgents. \"Humanitarian exchange is the first step toward a friendly understanding, which permits the return of our brothers deprived of their liberty,\" politician Armando Acuna said shortly after he was released by the FARC leftist guerrilla group Friday. Marine Henry Lopez Martinez was also released Friday and met family members at an airport in the country's capital. \"This is the most beautiful moment of the liberations, the loving reuniting of the families. For this, all the effort is worth it,\" former Sen. Piedad Cordoba, who helped coordinate the humanitarian mission to free them, said in a Twitter post. Acuna and Lopez are among a group of five hostages that the FARC leftist guerrilla organization pledged to release in December. Red Cross rescuers also participated in Friday's mission. Helicopters bearing the organization's symbol flew into the jungle Wednesday to free the first of the group: a councilman from the town of San Jose de Guaviare. Two other hostages -- a police major and a military service member -- are expected to be released Sunday. Some have suggested the hostage releases could fuel renewed dialogue between Colombia's government and the rebels. But news of two more kidnappings by the FARC drew the ire of Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. The president said Thursday that he was tempted to call off the rescue mission after learning that two workers from the Carton de Colombia company had been kidnapped in southwestern Colombia Wednesday night. \"We are not going to suspend the liberations, because I do not want to frustrate the excitement and hope of the families of these hostages that are going to be freed, but what I want to say is that this game, this double standard, is totally unacceptable,\" he said. The FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia, have been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s.

Charlie Rogers -- a former basketball player for the University of Nebraska who identifies herself as lesbian -- told police that three masked men entered her home on July 22, stripped her, tied her down, and carved homophobic slurs into her body before attempting to set her and the house on fire. But the Lincoln Police Department said Tuesday that \"the physical evidence conflicted with Charlie Rogers' version of events\" and that \"extensive investigation revealed numerous inconsistencies.\" Previously on CNN.com: Woman speaks out after alleged hate crime . Rogers was arrested Tuesday, police said. Her attorney, Brett McArthur, told CNN Tuesday night that Rogers had agreed as part of an arrangement to turn herself in, in exchange for a personal recognizance bond. \"She did not have to post any money\" to be released, McArthur said, adding that his client pleaded not guilty to the charge of lying to police. \"She maintains her innocence. This has been kind of a kick in the gut as a victim to turn around and be charged,\" McArthur said. In a news release, police cited DNA and pathologists' examinations that did not substantiate Rogers' original statements, and changes in her story during the investigation. \"These were serious allegations that garnered national attention and spread fear among local citizens,\" the police statement said. \"A great deal of time and resources were spent investigating Charlie Rogers' claims in hopes of identifying and arresting the three suspects in this case.\" Beth Rigatuso, president of Heartland Pride based in Omaha, organized a vigil that attracted over 1,000 people in the aftermath of the reported attack. For her, the news that it may have been a hoax is \"a pretty big blow.\" \"I don't feel betrayed as much as I feel sad for how, if this is really true...there is a lot of things going on with her,\" Rigatuso said. \"It leads to a bigger problem in our society that someone would do this.\" Rigatuso said she hopes people would not turn their backs on Rogers now. The vigil she put together in Omaha raised more than $1,800, all of which was deposited in an account for Rogers. \"We'd like to get the funds returned to us so we can establish our own fund to support victims of anti-gay violence.\" Rigatuso said Tuesday. McArthur, Rogers' attorney, said he \"knows nothing\" about the fund or how much money might be in it. He said it was in place before he became Rogers' lawyer. According to the Lincoln Police Department complaint, Rogers, 33, provided information \"she knew to be false\" with the intent to \"instigate an investigation of an alleged criminal matter.\" Rogers reported to police that she was lying on her bed when the alleged attackers held her down and carved \"derogatory words\" into her arms and abdomen and \"a cross\" in her chest. She told police she was then rolled onto her stomach where more cuts were made. But according to a deposition from Lincoln police investigator Lynette Russell filed as part of the complaint, Rogers bedspread was \"evenly placed on the bed and no apparent sign of a struggle.\" A DNA lab test found no evidence of blood on the bedspread. Russell also described a pair of white gloves found at the scene that Rogers had said were not hers. \"Ms. Rogers DNA profile was the major contributor to the DNA located on the inside of the gloves,\" Russell said. Furthermore, the deposition said, the FBI sent photos of Rogers' cuts to a forensic pathologist, who believed the wounds to be self-inflicted. \"This opinion is based partially on the fact that the cuts appeared superficial and symmetrical, avoided sensitive areas of the body,...are accessible to the victim and follow the victim's frame of reference for reading and writing,\" the deposition said. Rumors had been circulating in recent weeks in Lincoln and on the Internet due to the fact that police had yet to pinpoint any suspects. The urge to respond to rumors prompted Rogers to give her one and only interview. \"For people to think this doesn't happen here, it does,\" Rogers told CNN affiliate KETV on July 27. \"It did.\" She refused to discuss the incident itself during that interview. Rogers' attorney at the time, Megan Mikolajczyk, told CNN her client was ready for a full interview early last week, but canceled saying \"things have changed.\" Mikolajczyk said Tuesday that she is no longer Rogers' attorney. According to neighbor Linda Rappl, Rogers' showed up on her doorstep bloodied in the early morning hours immediately following the alleged attack last month. \"I was in shock,\" Rappl said soon after the incident. \"She was naked, her hands were tied with zip ties. All I could see was a cut across her forehead and blood running down.\" Rappl said she took the sobbing Rogers inside and wrapped her in a blanket before calling 911.\n### Response :", "target": "NEW: The woman pleads not guilty to lying to police, her attorney says .\nNEW: \"This has been kind of a kick in the gut as a victim to ... be charged,\" lawyer says .\nCharlie Rogers told police she was attacked in her home last month .\nAuthorities now say the incident was staged .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Now, amid an even larger investigation into the deaths of two Kaufman County prosecutors this year, that former official, Eric Williams, is jailed on $3 million bond -- charged with two counts of insufficient bond and one count of making a \"terroristic threat.\" Authorities haven't explained the charges and they have not said if Williams' arrest over the weekend is related to the investigation into the deaths of District Attorney Mike McLelland, McLelland's wife, Cynthia, and Mark Hasse -- the prosecutor who last year accused Williams of \"using Kaufman County as his own piggy bank.\" Hasse, Kaufman County's chief felony prosecutor, died in a brazen daytime shooting outside the courthouse January 31. Someone shot McLelland, the county's district attorney, and his wife, Cynthia, late last month at their Forney, Texas, home. Authorities have not named a suspect or a motive for the killings. Federal, state and local authorities looking into the killings searched Williams' home on Friday, according to an FBI spokeswoman. A day later, Texas Rangers and FBI agents combed through a storage facility in Seagoville, Texas, on a search warrant also tied to the prosecutors' deaths, the spokeswoman said. CNN affiliates KTVT and WFAA, citing anonymous sources, said authorities found 20 weapons and a white Ford Crown Victoria in the storage unit. The car, KTXA reported, matches the description of one seen near the McLellands' home around the time of their deaths. Authorities have not named Williams as a suspect in the deaths. Nor have they said the storage locker search had anything to do with the former justice of the peace, who has denied any involvement in the deaths through his attorneys and in interviews with local media. On Friday, Williams' attorney, David Sergi, released a statement saying his client \"has cooperated with law enforcement and vigorously denies any and all allegations. He wishes simply to get on with his life and hopes that the perpetrators are brought to justice.\" Sergi did not respond to repeated e-mail and telephone messages over the weekend and Monday seeking comment on developments in the case. In March 2012 -- almost a year before McLelland's death -- Hasse and McLelland played prominent roles in prosecuting Williams on one count of burglary and one count of theft by a public official. Accused of stealing computer equipment from a county building, he was convicted and sentenced to two years of probation. After the trial, McLelland rejoiced that the conviction showed the county's \"good ol' boy network is gone,\" according to media reports. Hasse called Williams \"dishonorable\" and a liar, according to the reports. But in a statement filed with the court after his conviction, Williams denied the thefts and called the loss of his law license \"a life long sentence.\" \"I will have to seek another career, with a felony I will not be able to earn what I am used to,\" he said, adding that it would be his wife, who he said was on disability, and his aging parents who would suffer the most. In a recent interview with North Texas TV station KXAS, Williams said he bore no ill will toward Hasse or McLelland, saying he felt the officials were just \"doing their jobs.\" But Bell, a reporter for The Forney Post, said McLelland told her before his death that he thought Williams was responsible for Hasse's death. He divulged his suspicion, she says, while cautioning her to be careful.

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you walk me through the main ideas?London (CNN) -- Icelandic volcano ash is affecting flights in European airspace, but authorities say it is unlikely to cause the same levels of disruption triggered by a similar eruption last year. So what are the main differences between the two volcanic ash clouds and to what extent will travel plans be hit? Who has been affected so far? Icelandic airspace was closed over the weekend. By early Tuesday, several hundreds flights from England, Scotland and Northern Ireland had been canceled with British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair, Aer Lingus, Loganair, Flybe and KLM among operators grounding jets. Meteorologist have warned prevailing winds are blowing the ash cloud towards London's Heathrow airport, potentially closing airspace above Europe's busiest air hub. Officials say there is a strong possibility some Scandinavian airports may also be affected. Send travel report to Twitter . Among those changing travel plans have been U.S. President Barack Obama, who flew into London a day ahead of schedule, and Barcelona's soccer team, which is traveling to the UK capital early ahead of Saturday's Champion's League final clash against Manchester United. How will the disruption differ from last year's? Ash from the eruption of Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano in April 2010 prompted the closure of airspace across Europe, stranding millions of passengers and costing the airline industry more than $2 billion. Authorities say there is uncertainty over how long the latest ash cloud, generated by Grimsvotn -- Iceland's most active volcano -- is likely to last, and how it will be affected by atmospheric changes. However, weather patterns indicate most mainland European airports will not be hit and airspace will remain open. Changes in flight safety regulations also mean fewer flights will be affected. What are the safety regulation changes? Most significantly, aviation authorities have raised the threshold on what density of ash cloud is considered safe to fly through. Last year, 200 micrograms of ash per cubic meter was seen as the maximum, this year it has been raised to 4,000 micrograms per cubic meter. Ash density is also being classified in terms of low, medium or high density. In theory, airlines can make a case to fly through all three provided they can prove they are taking adequate safety precautions. Irish carrier Ryanair has, however, condemned these limited restrictions as pointless. It said it has successfully piloted a test flight into an area of high ash density, with no adverse affects. What other differences are there? Scientists and airlines say the type of ash produced by Grimsvotn is potentially less harmful to aircraft engines than that thrown up by Eyjafjallajokull. According to a study by the Institute of Earth Sciences at the University of Iceland, ash particles from Eyjafjallajokull were unusually fine and angular due to the higher silica content of the magma produced in the eruption. This \"stickier\" magma caused a powerful explosion when it hit the volcano's ice cap, resulting in smaller and sharper ash particles capable of traveling further and remaining airborne longer. The larger particles produced by Grimsvotn, though still capable of traveling far, are more likely to fall out of the sky sooner. Jeremy Phillips of Bristol University's Earth Sciences department told CNN that Grimsvotn's eruptions are typically shorter than the Eyjafjallajokull event of 2010, lasting only a few days. What rights do affected passengers have? Last year's eruption left tens of thousands of passengers scrambling to make alternative travel plans via road, rail and sea amid debate over who was liable to compensate them for inconveniences faced. This year, the situation is far clearer, following court rulings over what is covered by travel insurance in the event of ash cloud disruption and clarified airline policy. According to UK consumer watchdog Which? delayed travelers are entitled to accommodation, food and phone calls. Those whose flights are canceled can expect refunds and re-routing to final destination.\n### Response :", "target": "Ash cloud prompts cancellation of dozens of flights, .\nAuthorities have raised safety threshold for flying in ash cloud .\nScientists say ash particles produced by Grimsvotn volcano are less hazardous than those from Eyjafjallajokull .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

The claim: \"Look at all the string of broken promises: ' If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,' \" Ryan said, repeating President Barack Obama's oft-stated vow. \"Try telling that to the 20 million people who are projected to lose their health insurance if Obamacare goes through or the 7.4 million seniors who are going to lose it.\" The Facts: . Ryan's claim that 20 million Americans will lose their health care under the Affordable Care Act refers to a government analysis in March. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation analyzed four scenarios and found a range of possibilities -- from Romney's figure of 20 million losing coverage due to Obamacare, to a net increase of 3 million gaining coverage. Fact Check: What about Benghazi? They concluded, \"In CBO and JCT's judgment, a sharp decline in employment-based health insurance as a result of the ACA is unlikely, and, if it occurred, would not dramatically increase the cost of the ACA.\" The 7.4 million figure refers to the elderly who would no longer stay in Medicare Advantage -- private plans that were intended to inject competition into Medicare, but wound up costing more. As a result, the Obama administration has moved to cut them. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected in a 2010 paper (\"Estimated Financial Effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\") that enrollment in the plans in 2017, when the Medicare Advantage cuts are to be fully phased in, will be about half (7.4 million) of what it would have been absent Obamacare. \"To say these folks would lose insurance is just not true,\" according to Prof. Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University. \"Any elderly person losing Medicare Advantage, if any, would automatically be covered by traditional Medicare,\" he said in a telephone interview.

Li Tianyi, 17, stood before Haidian People's Court in a closed hearing in Beijing Wednesday and Thursday, one of five defendants accused of raping a woman in a hotel room in February after drinking with her in a bar. Li, who also goes by the name Li Guanfeng, told the court he was drunk and could remember little of the night in question, but denied beating or having sex with the woman, the state-run Beijing News reported. While Li's four co-accused issued guilty pleas by the trial's end, Li continued to deny the allegations, state media reported. Li is the baby-faced son of 74-year-old Li Shuangjiang, a celebrity singer for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and dean of music at the PLA Academy of Arts, who became a household name for his renditions of patriotic anthems on television. The teen's mother, Meng Ge, is also a well-known PLA singer, and attended court to support her son. Li has previously made headlines for running afoul of the law. In 2011, aged 15, he was arrested after attacking a family in a road rage accident. Li, who was driving a BMW with no license plates, angrily confronted the occupants of a vehicle blocking his way, threatening bystanders and daring them to call police. Explore: China's new leaders . He had previously racked up 36 traffic violations while driving without a license, according to media reports, triggering an outcry when the incident was reported. He was subsequently sent to a juvenile detention center for a year, and his father issued a public apology. Tian Canjun, lawyer for the alleged victim in the rape case, said his client had been hospitalized due to stress and would not be attending the trial, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Lawyers for the accused have argued in pre-trial hearings that the woman was a prostitute, and the matter should be tried as a prostitution matter, rather than a rape case. The trial has caused a sensation in China, focusing public attention once again on the excessive lifestyles of China's rich and powerful and their families, who are widely seen as entitled and corrupt. It comes hot on the heels of the sensational trial of former Communist Party kingpin Bo Xilai, which offered a lurid snapshot of alleged corruption among China's political aristocracy. Chinese social media users have been scathing of Li, who has become one of the most infamous examples of a \"taizidang,\" or \"princeling.\" \"This just demonstrates that the elite class is above the law in China,\" wrote a user called @woshixiaojuanmao_loving on the popular Chinese micro-blogging service Sina Weibo. Read more: Privileged kids anger Chinese public . \"Meng Ge has totally failed in educating and nurturing her son,\" wrote another, using the handle @ingyunyixiuge777. \"This case gives us a glimpse of the corruption in China, and the government should punish the criminal severely to sound a warning to others.\" In July, hackers attacked the website of one of Li's lawyers, leaving a message stating: \"We just want to return justice to the client.\" Public opinion has been mounting against the princelings since an incident in 2010, when the drunk-driving 22-year-old son of a deputy provincial police chief fatally ran over a student and shouted: \"Sue me if you dare! My father is Li Gang!\" The phrase has since become synonymous with nepotism and corruption in China. Recognizing the threat posed by the popular discontent over the issue, President Xi Jinping has made a priority of stamping out abuses by officials, with a high-profile anti-corruption campaign that has toppled senior figures including the former railways minister and a top economic planning official. He has recently focused his attention on the PLA's musicians, many of whom have celebrity status. On Monday, he publicly rebuked PLA musicians following a series of embarrassing reports detailing their privileged lifestyles and exposing incidents of commercial exploitation of their positions. The dressing down was accompanied by new measures, signed off by Xi and detailed in the PLA Daily, the official organ of China's armed forces, designed to curb the excesses of military musical troupes. Xi's wife, the noted soprano Peng Liyuan, herself served in a PLA performance troupe.

{"source": "### Instruction :What are the central ideas presented?\n### Input:Washington (CNN)  -- Look no further than the two warning flares shot up from Virginia and New Hampshire Tuesday evening to understand how concerned Democrats are about the political consequences of losing the late Sen. Edward Kennedy's seat to Republican Scott Brown. Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, called on his Democratic colleagues to suspend votes on their controversial health care legislation, warning it would be wrong to try to muscle a bill through Congress before Brown was sworn into office. \"In many ways, the campaign in Massachusetts became a referendum not only on health care reform but also on the openness and integrity of our government process,\" Webb said in a statement. Some 500 miles to the north, New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley sent out an urgent plea for donations to help fund a special election next month for a state senate seat he fears losing. \"Over the past few weeks, radical right-wing activists turned Massachusetts into ground zero for the Tea Party movement, and we saw a taste of what's to come in 2010,\" Buckley wrote. Brown's victory has changed the political narrative in 2010. Weigh in on the election results . Traditionally, the president's party loses seats in the midterm elections. But now there is concern among some politically savvy Democrats who worry that the losses could be greater than originally anticipated in November all because of Brown's win. \"It makes it really hard,\" a senior Democratic operative, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Tuesday evening. \"The frustrating thing for (Democratic) members is that it was preventable, it affects them and it was something that never should have gotten to this point.\" In a matter of two weeks, Democrats witnessed a sleeping Republican base come to life to rally around a little-known GOP candidate, who defied the odds to win the race to succeed the liberal lion from Massachusetts. And after watching two governorships slip from their grasp in November, many Democrats have come to realize that the American public is not particularly happy with their stewardship of the nation. Democrats have 10 months to try to regain the momentum, but the wind is now at the Republicans' backs, and their first legislative victory will likely be slamming the brakes on President Obama's signature domestic issue: health care reform. It is a mighty blow for a president, who just one year ago seemed unbreakable, unstoppable, unbeatable. Brown is an unlikely savior for the Republican Party, which one year ago was disoriented, disorganized and disillusioned. A Massachusetts Republican has successfully brought together -- for the time being -- a party at war over the ideological purity of its membership. There is still discord in the GOP, but Brown's win gives Republicans another case study in how to run a successful campaign after their two gubernatorial wins in New Jersey and Virginia. Martha Coakley's loss provides Democrats with yet another example of how not to run a campaign after their earlier losses in New Jersey and Virginia. One of the biggest challenges for Democrats is wooing back independent voters, who broke Brown's way Tuesday to help him beat Coakley. \"If we don't figure out a way to talk to independent voters, we are done,\" lamented another high-level Democratic staffer, speaking freely on the condition of anonymity. Republicans wake up Wednesday morning with a new vigor, and GOP strategists vow to try to use this win to broaden a playing field that one year ago seemed unrealistic. The GOP's top target is Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who is in danger of losing re-election, according to public polls. But Republicans hope Tuesday's victory also convinces some fence-sitting Democrats to follow the leads of Dennis Moore of Kansas or Rep. John Tanner of Tennessee and choose to retire instead of running for re-election. For Obama, the loss will likely force him to reconsider his legislative priorities, as his support on Capitol Hill wanes in this midterm election year. Conservative Democrats are less likely to back him on controversial issues such as health care and cap and trade, fearing that to do so would be political suicide. After all, Republicans were able to win Kennedy's seat by running against the Obama agenda.\n### Response : ", "target": "Analysis: Many Democrats now realize public isn't particularly happy with their stewardship .\nWind is now at the Republicans' backs, and they may be able to put brakes on health bill .\nScott Brown's win gives GOP another case study in how to run successful campaign .\nFor President Obama, loss will likely force him to reconsider his legislative priorities .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers wasn't afraid to say this month that his men were title contenders and with the offense flowing, his team trails Chelsea by a mere four points atop the standings. Daniel Sturridge -- second behind only teammate Luis Suarez in league scoring -- netted for an eighth straight Premier League outing to close in on Dutchman Ruud van Nistelrooy's record of 10. \"It was an important win for us,\" Rodgers told Sky Sports. \"We certainly weren't at our best today but the offensive part of our game, which is very strong, came out on top again. \"It's an outstanding result for us and the game typified the character of this team.\" Liverpool looked set to cruise when Henderson and Sturridge gave Liverpool a 2-0 lead within 20 minutes. But Swansea, under newish boss Garry Monk, didn't cave in. Jonjo Shelvey began a comeback against his former club and Wilfried Bony made it 2-2 in the 27th minute. After Sturridge and Bony traded goals -- the latter's second came via the penalty spot -- Henderson settled the affair in the 74th minute when he scored on his own rebound.

They found that having more than 20 male partners doubled the risk of prostate cancer and made an aggressive cancer five times more likely. Sleeping with one male partner did not affect the risk. \n  \n Video: Prostate cancer on the rise in UK \n  \n  \n  \n Meanwhile, men who were virgins were almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer as those who were sexually experienced. \n  \n The findings are from the Prostate Cancer & Environment Study in which 3,208 men answered questions about their lifestyle and sex lives. \n  \n Of these men, 1,590 were diagnosed with prostate cancer between September 2005 and August 2009, while 1,618 men were part of the control group. \n  \n Overall, men with prostate cancer were twice as likely as others to have a relative with cancer, but the study also found a possible link with their number of sexual partners. \n  \n Lead researcher Professor Marie-Elise Parent, from the University of Montreal, said: \"It is possible that having many female sexual partners results in a higher frequency of ejaculations, whose protective effect against prostate cancer has been previously observed in cohort studies.\" \n  \n According to one theory, large numbers of ejaculations may reduce the concentration of cancer-causing substances in prostatic fluid, a constituent of semen. \n  \n They may also lead to fewer crystal-like structures in the prostate that have been associated with prostate cancer. \n  \n Suggesting why the same did not apply to male partners Professor Parent admitted she could only provide \"highly speculative\" explanations. \n  \n One explanation she said \"could be that anal intercourse produces a physical trauma to the prostate\". \n  \n The age at which men first had sexual intercourse, and the number of times they had been infected by a sexually transmitted disease, had no bearing on prostate cancer risk. \n  \n A total of 12 per cent of the group reported having had at least one sexually transmitted infection (STI) in their lifetime. \n  \n Professor Parent added: \"We were fortunate to have participants from Montreal who were comfortable talking about their sexuality, no matter what sexual experiences they have had, and this openness would probably not have been the same 20 or 30 years ago. \n  \n \"Indeed, thanks to them, we now know that the number and type of partners must be taken into account to better understand the causes of prostate cancer.\" \n  \n On the question of whether promiscuity might now be recommended in health advice to men, she said: \"We're not there yet.\" \n  \n The research is published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology. \n  \n Additional reporting by Press Association ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. |||||\n### Response:", "target": "\u2013 One defense against prostate cancer may be promiscuity.

As for virgins, they faced double the cancer risk faced by those who'd had sex, the Telegraph reports. The reasons behind the findings aren't clear, but lead researcher Marie-Elise Parent notes that frequent sex means more frequent ejaculation; earlier studies, she says, have indicated that frequent ejaculation helps prevent prostate cancer. But the findings, based on surveys of 3,200 subjects, didn't hold true for men sleeping with men, the Independent reports. Men who had sex exclusively with men and had had more than 20 partners actually saw twice the prostate cancer risk of men who'd never slept with men. Parent says she has only \"highly speculative\" explanations for that, and anyway, those findings weren't statistically significant. So is all this a good reason for men to run out and sleep with as many women as possible? Parent throws a little cold water on that particular fire: \"I don't think we can say that.

The group has turned to crowdsourcing website Indiegogo to raise funds for its campaign, which aims to encourage condom usage among local youth in a country where an estimated 1.6 million people struggle with HIV/AIDS. \"They were giving out free condoms when I went to the HIV conference in Cape Town recently,\" says CAFS director of operations Jonathan Spangler. \"These condoms were brightly colored, like nothing seen in Kenya -- glow in the dark, different flavors, different prints. We put a picture of them on Facebook and we had youth calling us up asking where they could purchase them,\" he adds. \"We've never had that sort of reaction to CAFS programs. So we said why don't we try produce our own condom line because there seems to be a market. We want to innovate and create new programming that is sustainable and even generates income for the youth,\" he adds.. Stigma vs. safety . HIV/AIDS continues to be one of the most prominent public health obstacles many African countries face today. In recent years, the disease -- which had reached epidemic proportions -- has started to decline in Kenya as a result of stronger public awareness campaigns and the impact of local education programs. While the outlook is positive, campaigners say more needs to be done to continue to reduce the threat of HIV/AIDS in the country -- a start could be made by tackling the stigma surrounding the purchase of condoms. \"Most people are actually very afraid of going to vendors in supermarkets and chemists to buy condoms because we are a fairly reserved society,\" explains Genevieve Imbali, communications and marketing officer at CAFS. \"Most people aren't very open to the idea that very young people might walk into a shop just to buy condoms because nobody wants to be known to be having sex ... There is so much stigma associated with condom purchase in the country.\" Eye-catching designs . To address this, the bright packaging of CAFS' colored condoms is specifically designed to disguise the product inside. Imbali explains that by making condoms less obvious, more people will be willing to buy them. She also says that the condoms currently available in the country are either too expensive or low quality -- issues, she claims, will be tackled with the CAFS condom line. \"For the condoms that are given out for free at schools, the youth still do not take them,\" argues Imbali. \"They look at them and think: 'You know what, you are giving this for free but they are not good quality.' So they'd probably just have unprotected sex rather than use the ones that are easily accessible.\" Collaborating with artists . But getting an artist to agree to provide designs for the packaging became a struggle. Many didn't want their work associated with sex and CAFS hit a roadblock -- until they met with Michael Soi. The Nairobi-based artist is well-known for his bold, but often controversial, themes placed within his paintings. Unafraid to shy away from taboo subjects like sex and interracial relationships, Soi was more than happy to collaborate with the NGO. \"I felt like everybody is basically trying to deal with this whole issue -- HIV, unwanted pregnancies -- and when I talk about everybody I mean the church is doing whatever they can, the government is doing whatever they can,\" says Soi. \"I felt the project was a good thing. I wanted to try to chip in and create something that would help fight a good fight,\" he says. Soi explains that sex isn't discussed openly and that as a result many young people learn about the dangers of unprotected sex the hard way -- through experience. However, he does believe awareness is increasing and he hopes his work will continue to change attitudes surrounding sex in Kenya. \"I think it's important to try and play a part and make sure that people will not go through the same mistakes as what my generation has gone through.\" READ THIS: How medics saved lives at Westgate .

How about a \"canned\" tornado or an \"uncanny\" sculpture of an apple being eaten by ants. Swarms of people are being delighted by the construction work in New York's World Financial Center during the city's  18th Annual CANstruction Competition. On display are 25 sculptures created from more than 100,000 cans of food -- designed and built by architects and engineers. Mia Tsiamis, a structural engineer from the firm ARUP, has been her team's captain for five years. Their entry \"Cangsta's Paradise\" took three months to design and 10 hours to build. \"The whole process is a lesson in project management. It's certainly a challenge squeezing it in with the rest of our daily work,\" said Tsiamis. New York is one of about 100 cities around the world taking part in the international charity competition known as CANstruction that is aimed at helping the hungry. Rules allow each team five people to work on their entry. The cans cannot be bound with glue or adhesives and designers are not allowed to color the cans -- so there is endless time donated to finding the tuna or bean cans with the properly colored labels for the particular design. Among the entries were an enormous Mr. Potato Head, the original Battleship board game, King Kong, Russian Babushka dolls and the Metropolitan Transit Authority designed a train. \"With some of the sculptures, you have to stand way back to see what has been created,\" said Daniel Garwood, a volunteer with American Institute of Architects, one of the presenters of the competition. A representation of Mario and Luigi of the \"Mario Brothers\" video games is one of those objects better seen from afar. Children were especially excited to see the exhibits, snapping pictures and staring in awe. Second- and third-graders of The Mustard Seed School in Hoboken, New Jersey, visited the site on a field trip. \"This year we are teaching them about buildings, foundations and service projects so this is the perfect combination!\" said art teacher Lynn Hamill. The youngsters were running around the larger-than-life canned art feverishly trying to complete an assignment. Jennifer Groce, a parent chaperone for the school, was trying to focus the kids'  excitement. \"They have to sketch the different projects and write down how many cans each structure is made of and how many New Yorkers will it feed,\" Groce said. The children picked favorites but  their top choices changed each time they saw the next structure down the line. \"I love Mario,\" one student said. \"Oh and this one too!\" He was pointing at another one. Celebrity chef and cookbook author Rocco Dispirito and host of Bravo's TV show \"Top Chef: Just Desserts\" Gail Simmons are among this year's judges who selected the winning sculptures. CANstruction is designed to raise hunger awareness during the Thanksgiving season. All of the cans used in the contest will be donated to City Harvest for distribution to programs that feed impoverished New Yorkers. Co-Presented by the American Institute of Architects, the Society for Design Administration and Arts World Financial Center, Canstruction is on display until November 22.\n### Response: ", "target": "Cans of food turn into  Mr. Potato Head, King Kong, a \"Tomato Tornado\"\nArchitects and engineers used 100,000 cans in 25 sculptures .\nAfter competition, all the cans of food used are donated to City Harvest .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?(CNN) -- Nokia is getting into the tablet business. The company announced a new 10-inch tablet called the Lumia 2520 on Tuesday at a press event in Abu Dhabi. The Windows RT device is Nokia's first full-sized tablet. The Finnish company is also going bigger with its smartphone line. It is releasing a new pair of colorful, big-screen smartphones: the 6-inch Windows Phone 9 Lumia 1520 and the lower-end 1320. The Lumia 2520 tablet will cost $499 and run Windows RT 8.1, a limited variation of the Windows 8 operating system that uses that system's tile-based touchscreen feature. The tablet gets 4G LTE, has a 2.2 GHz Quad Core processor and includes a 6.7 megapixel back-facing camera. The company says it has upped the screen's peak brightness so it's extra visible outdoors in direct sunlight. For its new smartphones, Nokia has chosen to continue its focus on the camera as the killer feature that can set its devices apart. Its Lumia 1020 smartphone's primary selling point was its impressive 40 megapixel camera. The new big-screen 1520 smartphone will have a smaller but still powerful 20 megapixel camera and cost $749 before any carrier subsides. The the cheaper 1320 has a more ordinary 5 megapixel camera and cost $399. The Nokia Camera app is getting an update across all Nokia devices. Six inches is a hefty size for smartphones, but Ifi Majid, Nokia's head of product marketing for North America, said the size was key because it's the largest a phone can go and still be held with one hand. While they haven't yet taken off in the U.S., \"phablet\" devices are a bigger hit in developing markets where the larger size is considered a status symbol. This is Nokia's first big product rollout since it was announced that Microsoft was going to purchase part of the company. The $7.2 billion deal, which will include Nokia's devices and services businesses, is still pending. It's unclear what kind of different direction Nokia's products will take when Microsoft is fully in charge, and where the new 2520 tablet will fit in with Windows own similar Surface line. Apple is the leading tablet manufacturer in the world, followed by Samsung, but all the major manufacturers are eager to get in on the growing market. Though Microsoft has been pushing its own Surface tablets and touchscreen-ified operating system, Windows 8, it still trails far behind iOS and Android tablets. Nokia was once the top mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It still holds on to a sizable chunk of the feature phone market, but is struggling to stay competitive against smartphones from Apple, Samsung, and other companies. Instead of making an Android-based smartphone like most non-Apple companies, Nokia took a bet on a third operating system, Windows Phone 8. Colorful and simple, but with an anemic selection of apps, Windows Phone 8 has struggled but slowly grown since making its debut a year ago. Getting big name apps has been one of the operating systems biggest challenges. Nokia says photo-sharing app Instagram will finally come to the platform in the next few weeks. There is still a market for less advanced phones that can last more than a day on a single battery charge. Nokia also announced three new Asha devices on Tuesday. Asha is Nokia's super simple, very cheap phone line. The tiny handsets cost between $60 and $99 and can make calls and text, run a few apps and even connect to the internet. Aimed at developing markets, they can also hold a charge for up to a month.\n### Response:", "target": "Nokia announced its first tablet, the 10-inch Lumia 2520 running Windows RT .\nThe company also announced a pair of large, 6-inch smartphones .\nThis is Nokia's first big press event since Microsoft announced it was buying part of the business .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

XP-1, the company\u2019s first Hyperloop pod, reached speeds of up to 310 km/h (192 mph) during the test, which is getting closer to the planned functional speeds of future Hyperloop installations planned for Dubai and elsewhere. \n  \n The new test breaks the recorded speed record for any Hyperloop tests ever conducted, including those done by research organizations participating in SpaceX\u2019s pod design competition. It was conducted on July 29, 2017, and included a 300 meter acceleration phase, with gradual breaking to come to a stop after that point. \n  \n Hyperloop One depressurized the tube for the test track down to conditions similar to those at 200,000 feet above sea level, which is part of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere where there is very little friction and resistance to the rarified air. The company says that all aspects of the system, from motors, to electronics, to the vacuum pump and magnetic levitation mechanism worked well during the test. \n  \n Just a couple of months ago in May, Hyperloop One completed its first ever test of its Nevada DevLoop track, which was intended to prove that the system would work at scale. The Phase 1 test was much more modest by comparison, with a 315-foot run vs. the 1,433-foot trial for Phase 2. It also only topped out at 69 mph, and only accelerated for 30 meters of its journey, vs. 300 meters for the new test. Hyperloop One also notes that the pod was driven by 3.5x the power in this test, achieving 3,151 horsepower vs. just 891 for the inaugural run. \n  \n Hyperloop One has stated it\u2019s aiming to achieve a top speed of 250 mph in the controlled testing environment of the DevLoop track, but it will require longer distances to achieve its target functional velocity: The planned route from Abu Dhabi to Dubai should be able to reach up to 500 mph, for instance, and make the roughly 100 mile trip in about 12 minutes. ||||| The future sounds a bit like a witch crying over a dead cat. That spooky wail is the sound hyperloop makes\u2014at least, the version of the high-speed transportation system designed by Hyperloop One, which just took a big stride toward the day it flings you between cities in near-vacuum tubes. \n  \n The Los Angeles company leading the race to fulfill Elon Musk\u2019s dream of tubular transit tested its pod for the first time last weekend. That pod is 28 feet long and made of aluminum and carbon fiber. It looks a bit like a bus with a beak. \n  \n A fast bus with a beak. Once loaded into a 1,600-foot-long concrete tube in the Nevada desert, the pod hit 192 mph in about 5 seconds, using an electric propulsion system producing more than 3,000 horsepower. As the pod accelerated through the tube 11 feet in diameter, the 16 wheels retracted as magnetic levitation took over. Mag-lev\u2014used by high-speed trains in Japan and elsewhere\u2014reduces drag and the energy required to achieve near-supersonic speeds. It helps, too, that Hyperloop One\u2019s engineers also pumped nearly all the air out of the tube, reducing air pressure to what you'd experience at an altitude of 200,000 feet. \n  \n \"This is the dawn of the age of commercialization for the hyperloop,\u201d says Shervin Pishevar, Hyperloop One's executive chairman and cofounder. \n  \n It's a big step, to be sure, but just one of many in the long journey ahead. The weekend test provided a nice proof of concept, but the challenge is not in making hyperloop work but in making it practical. For hyperloop to truly take off, it must operate cheaply enough to lure customers away from air travel or high-speed rail. And then there's the problem of loading people or, more likely, cargo without ruining that near-vacuum state, designing and building stations, getting an endless list of public agencies and players to agree to build the thing, and so on. \n  \n All that comes later, and chief engineer Josh Geigel says Hyperloop One is indeed working on cracking those myriad challenges.

Last month French commandoes landed in Somalia and captured a group of pirates. Lars Walder, of Reider Shipping BV, which owns the MV Amiya Scan, revealed the company has been in contact with the hijackers and that none of the crew had been harmed. \"Everybody was fine under the circumstances,\" he said, speaking from Winschoten, Netherlands. \"They were all fine ... [and] were treated quite well.\" The ship was anchored off the coast of Somalia, within Somalia's 20-kilometer (12-mile) territorial limit, Walder said. He would not comment on the pirates' demands out of concern for the crew of four Russians and five Filipinos, and would not say whether the shipping company was negotiating with them. He said he assumed the pirate gang was armed but they have not told him how many they are or whether the are associated with any group. The ship, carrying parts of an old oil rig, was chartered by Scan-Trans Shipping, and was traveling from Kenya to Romania, Walder said. It flies under an Antiguan flag. \"Of course, we hope we get our people,\" Walder said. He said that the shipping company had contacted all relevant countries for help, including the Netherlands, Russia, and Somalia. Wary of previous hijackings near the Somali coast, Walder said the MV Amiya Scan had not been traveling within the country's 12-mile (20-kilometer) territorial limit when it was seized. There have been 24 attacks on ships near the Somali coast and in the Gulf of Aden this year, said Capt. Pottengal Mukundan, director of the International Maritime Bureau, which tracks pirate attacks. Of those 24, he said, seven have been successful hijackings. Cyrus Mody of the same bureau said that Somali pirates seem to take ships \"purely for financial gain.\" In the seven cases this year, most were resolved with a ransom payment, Mody said, adding that the pirates in Somalia typically treat the crews on the hijacked ships well. Mody added there are at least four distinct pirate groups in the country and it is difficult to tell which group is responsible for which hijacking. A draft resolution introduced to the U.N. Security Council last month would combat Somali hijackings by allowing foreign governments to pursue pirate vessels into Somalia's territorial waters and make arrests. The resolution, sponsored by the United States, Panama, France and Britain, noted that Somalia's transitional government welcomes international assistance.

{"source": "### Instruction: How would you briefly describe the text?(CNN) -- Turkey is no Egypt and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan no Hosni Mubarak. This is not a \"Turkish Spring,\" but a message to an elected leader to reign in his hubris and his divisive politics. These are some of the central messages, which both Turkish commentators (ourselves included), and the international media have brought across. Erdogan still has a choice, as the Financial Times reminds us, between rising to the highs of statesmanship of former French President Charles de Gaulle or spending his remaining political life as a Turkish likeness of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The question now being asked in Turkey's capital Ankara, on Istanbul's Taksim Square and in the occupied Gezi Park, where the initial protests started, is whether Erdogan has the political determination and the nerve to accept the demands of the initial protestors. WATCH MORE: 'Lady in red' does not want to be a symbol . That would mean giving up on his personal dream to build the Ottoman barracks on the park and turn it into a shopping mall. His track record would suggest otherwise. Probably the single most important trigger for the rapid spread of events was the prime minister's inability to listen to critique and disagreement, and the way in which this inability has manifested over the last few years. His rhetoric has been spiraling out of control and has ranged from lecturing women on how many children to bear to calling everyone who enjoys drinking a beer in a sidewalk cafe an alcoholic. READ MORE: Erdogan defends handling of protests . Further, the country has used an excessively violent policing strategy, with which the government has oppressed almost all legitimate protest by trade unions, political movements and student groups. All this extreme use of force looks awkward in a country where the government was re-elected with almost 50% of the vote only two years ago and where its macro-economic development indicators tell a story of unfettered progress. One might wonder why a government that still enjoys such popular support is unable to tolerate a few protests here and there and is incapable of giving into what are often very reasonable demands against the excesses of environmental degradation and rent-based urban renewal policies. Why would an elected prime minister, who has, until now, been respected abroad and at home, use the force of his security apparatus to crush so brutally any popular dissent, which is far from threatening his place at the top of Turkey's political system? WATCH MORE: The week that changed Turkey . Part of the answer lies in Turkey's recent record of undemocratic manipulations to bring the government down. Kemalist elites, the military, the judiciary and the so-called \"deep state\" rogue elements acting within the visible state structures, conspired to terminate the Justice and Development Party's (AKP) government from the very moment of its first election in 2002. Ever since, the party had to face several attempts at power grab, from an ultra-nationalist conspiracy in the mid-2000s based on unresolved assassinations of Christian missionaries and the murder of Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink to the so-called Republican Marches against the election as President of Abdullah Gul to the Constitutional Court's only narrowly averted closure case against the ruling party in 2008. All of these experiences have led Erdogan and many members of the AKP government to look at Turkish politics through the prism of conspiracies, and the blame for this shift does not lie only with the AKP. More significantly though, the manipulations they faced from the judiciary and the military have led the AKP government to fill both institutions with sympathizers, thereby removing the already weak system of checks and balances in Turkey. READ MORE: Erdogan: Leader or 'dictator'? The confluence of both the conspiratorial mind-set and a lack of checks and balances has created the ground for Erdogan's unhealthy mix of extreme self-confidence on the one side and his insecurity vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis criticism on the other. The shopping mall in Gezi Park, the third bridge over the Bosporus, the new airport and a canal project that is supposed to connect the Marmara and the Black Sea have been devised without any consultation and public debate. That the prime minister sees any criticism of these projects as manipulations by domestic and external enemies is a sign of his insecurity. That he failed to grasp that the Taksim protests were not started by undercover military agents, die-hard Kemalists, Iranian agents or Syrian provocateurs may yet mark the beginning of his undoing. Will Erdogan be able to arrive at a sober consideration of the situation and give in to the demands of the protestors in Gezi Park, call an impartial review of police brutality and reconsider the heavy policing strategies, which have turned Turkey into a police state? WATCH MORE: Turkey as a 'pivotal' country . If he did, he would still have a chance to enter Turkish history as a statesman who carried his country into the 21st century, disassembled the military's tutelage, ended the Kurdish War and granted long-fought-for rights to the country's largest minority, the Kurds. If he fails, and drags the country towards polarization and political unrest, his government, the economy and hence the people of Turkey will lose.

Specifically, he referenced a bounty set for the death of U.S. Ambassador to Yemen, Gerald Feierstein. \"These prizes have a great effect in instilling fear in the hearts of our cowardly enemies,\" Gadahn who has a $1 million dollar bounty on his head, says in the video. \"They also encourage hesitant individuals to carry out important and great deeds in the path of Allah.\" The California-raised Islamic convert, also known as Azzam the American, spoke entirely in Arabic throughout the video, \"The Exploits of Muslims and Infamies of the Criminals.\" It was produced by al-Qaeda's as-Sahab Media Foundation and posted to jihadi websites. \"The dead American ambassador Christopher Stevens wasn't a friend of Libya\" Gadahn asserts, saying instead he was \"representative of the empire of evil and corruption, America\". Multiple American embassies across North Africa and the Middle East were closed earlier this month in light of intelligence information suggesting a possible attack. All have reopened. But an administration official, asked whether the closures were linked to the Gadahn video, told CNN that while al Qaeda's general intentions were a factor in the closures, \"this video was not specifically a factor.\" Gadahn has made similar videos in the past. In 2007, he also called for attacks on U.S. diplomats, vowing that al Qaeda would target American diplomats and embassies in retaliation for the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.

The Su-25 has been in service for more than three decades and was part of the Iraqi air force under Saddam Hussein's regime.

Iraq has now turned to Russia and Belarus to buy fighter jets, he said. \"God willing, within one week, this force will be effective and will destroy the terrorists' dens,\" he said. U.S. officials were quick to reject al-Maliki's complaints. U.S. fighter jets have not been slow in coming, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. The first two promised F-16s \"weren't expected to be delivered until the fall, which is still months away,\" Kirby said. \"And we were in the process of working towards that delivery.\" The advance of an al Qaeda splinter group \"couldn't have been stemmed through the use of two particular fighter planes,\" he said.

But in this crowded, materialistic city, there's a man trying to build a business from de-stressing the workplace. \"The wellness of employees is the wellness of the company; the very strength of a company is its employees,\" said Dario Calvaruso, a yoga instructor who set up Holistic Wellness -- a company that offers a series of in-office programs to reduce stress. He's on a mission to make yoga mats an essential fixture under every Hong Kong worker's desk. The 39-year old spent 15 years living in India studying the ancient discipline, which seeks to relax those who practice it, through elongation, slow movement and controlled breathing. Opportunity . When Calvaruso moved to Hong Kong in October 2011, opportunity knocked on his door. \"Many of my friends were major company managers and approached me for private (yoga) classes,\" Calvaruso said. \"After seeing its benefits they thought 'this should come to my company'.\" Within this territory's constricted work spaces, practicing yoga requires relatively little room and minimal equipment -- a large ball and a mat are enough. As the instructor plays calm music, everyone stretches, breathes deeply and closes their eyes. \"All the team is present at the lessons and it's a great way to start our day,\" said Manuele Bosetti, general manager of the Italian Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and Macao. This organization has to deal with the day-to-day problems of its member companies and sometimes taking the time to listen can be a challenge, Bosetti told CNN. But performing yoga as a group has helped. \"We noticed that everyone at the office was more relaxed, and we managed to treat our business partners in a more kind way,\" Bosetti added. Suited and ready . The sight of practitioners in their work clothes surrounded by computers and other electronics may seem incongruous with relaxation and meditation, but Calvaruso believes yoga performed in his studio is similar to that done in corporate environments -- although people in the workplace may face unique problems. For example, students at a studio yoga class may practice over many years, while those in corporate settings may be unfamiliar with the discipline. \"In an office, maybe people don't know anything about yoga,\" Calvaruso told CNN. \"They may feel discomfort, frozen shoulders; we try to release all the tension from the shoulders to give them proper alignment.\" Desk ergonomics are another common focus for yoga classes in offices. And the result? \"Employees perform better, produce more, and of course, the company has bigger profits,\" Calvaruso said. Nevertheless, it can be difficult to inspire managers to interrupt their team's workday for a few minutes of relaxation. \"In Asia, (employee wellness) is still new, it's growing,\" said Calvaruso, who believes the region lags behind Europe and the United States when it comes to measures that actively help employees find a balance between work and leisure. This instructor's uphill battle goes against Asia's economic dynamism. An insatiable hunger for ever-larger returns and continuous growth is the new culture of this region, and it seems to have replaced much centuries-old wisdom that teaches spiritual development through balance, meditation and harmony with nature.\n### Response :", "target": "Dario Calvaruso, 39, teaches yoga classes in a different kind of studio -- the office .\nHe spent 15 years in India studying yoga before moving to Hong Kong .\nCorporate wellness is still a developing concept in Hong Kong .\nManagers don't always see the link between staff well-being and company profits .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me the gist of this text?Los Angeles (CNN) -- Claims of extortion and laughter-inducing testimony stemming from legal advice on e-mails highlighted Tuesday's proceedings in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial. Randy Phillips, the chief executive officer of AEG Live, disclosed that his lawyers advised company executives not to review old e-mails before testifying. That strategy could explain the high number of \"I don't recall\" answers by Paul Gongaware, the concert promoter's co-CEO, during his deposition and six days of testimony that have just concluded. Phillips, who followed Gongaware on the witness stand Tuesday afternoon, said he believed Jackson's mother and three children were trying to extort money from his company, which he insisted bears no liability in the pop icon's death in 2009. The Jacksons' lawsuit accuses the company of negligently hiring, retaining or supervising Dr. Conrad Murray, the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's drug overdose death. AEG lawyers contend Jackson chose, paid and controlled Murray, who infused him with the surgical anesthetic propofol almost every night for a month to help the singer rest as he prepared for his comeback \"This Is It\" concerts. AEG exec: I didn't know Michael Jackson abused drugs . Jackson lawyer Brian Panish, who has been previously told by the judge not to argue with witnesses, quickly tangled with Phillips. \"Please don't argue with me because then I will argue back and get in trouble,\" Panish told Phillips at one point. \"Then that's an incentive for me,\" Phillips joked. The feisty chemistry between lawyer and witness promises to keep jurors, who often chuckle at Panish's courtroom behavior, on the edge of their seats for the next day or so. Gongaware's testimony was punctuated with so many \"I don't recall\" responses that jurors began laughing at one point. He frequently said he couldn't recall sending or reading key e-mails in the case, although his e-mail address was on them. Panish asked Gongaware whether he thought it would have been better for him if he had reviewed documents and e-mails before testifying. \"I relied on the advice of my attorney,\" he said. With his testimony concluded, Gongaware will resume his responsibilities as tour manager for the Rolling Stones. \"All this legal stuff, I don't understand it,\" he said. What killed Elvis? It's a question at Michael Jackson's death trial . Phillips, a law school dropout, seemed ready to rumble when he entered court after Gongaware. But he acknowledged that until two weeks ago, he had not looked at any of his old e-mails to refresh his memory. \"They felt it would be better if I went in without preparation,\" he said, referring to his lawyers. AEG Live lawyer Marvin Putman said outside of court that the volume of documents they would have needed to review was massive, making it impossible for them to prepare. E-mails that AEG Live executives sent and received in the months before Jackson's death include one in which Phillips assures show director Kenny Ortega that the company has \"checked out\" Murray and found him to be very successful. AEG Live executives later acknowledged they did not do a background check on Murray, who a police detective testified was in debt for more than $1 million dollars and faced foreclosure on his home. \"I wrote it in the e-mail that I thought at the time he had been checked out,\" Phillips testified Tuesday. He wrote that Murray was successful \"because that's what I was told,\" he said. \"In retrospect, it's not 100% true,\" Phillips said. \"There's what I thought at the time versus what I learned afterwards.\" Phillips, Gongaware and other AEG Live executives ignored red flags that should have alerted them that Jackson's life was in danger, the Jackson lawsuit contends. Murray signed and faxed his $150,000-a-month contract back to AEG Live, but with Jackson's death the next day on June 25, 2009, Phillips didn't sign it. AEG lawyers argue that means it was not a fully executed agreement and Murray was never hired by them.

Broadcasts praising leader Kim Jong Un while putting down the United States as the country's mortal enemy. These images of North Korea from state media portray a proud, strong and self-reliant country. But behind the propaganda and beyond the capital of Pyongyang is the harsher reality of poverty, hunger and desperation, defectors say. \"My family had decided to commit suicide because for three days we didn't have anything to eat,\" said one North Korean female defector to ITN in Seoul. \"We decided to starve to death. We said let's die. But then I wanted to survive. I sold the house for 30 kilos of rice.\" She escaped North Korea shortly after leader Kim Jong Un came to power last year -- her identity kept secret because she left family behind. \"To survive, I had to eat grass. People pick grass and leaves and use them to make soup,\" said the defector who now lives in South Korea. Reports out of North Korea suggest food prices have tripled in the past year. More than 25% of North Korean children under the age of five suffered from chronic malnutrition in 2012, according to the National Nutrition Survey of North Korea, a report backed by UNICEF, the World Food Program and the World Health Organization. The report also found nearly one in three women suffered from anemia. As many as 3.5 million people are estimated to have died during North Korea's severe famine of the 1990s, according to South Korean NGO Good Friends Center for Peace, Human Rights, and Refugees. Official North Korean numbers estimate 220,000 people died. \"One thing that struck me is just how empty this land looks. I'm told that only about 20% of North Korea is arable,\" said CNN's Stan Grant on a reporting trip to North Korea in April 2012. \"And the people move so slowly out here. Sometimes you see someone ambling across a field carrying a hoe or holding a shovel. Other times you see children wandering by the side of the road.

The people themselves are smaller,\" said Simon Cockerell of Beijing-based Koryo Tours. \"Like for any developing country, the capital city is the best place to be. Wages are higher and people tend to be better off,\" he said. \"But then we go out to second-tier cities -- Chongjin and Hamhung, North Korea's second and third biggest cities -- and it's clearly much drabber than Pyongyang.\" Cockerell, who has been leading tour groups across North Korea for the past 11 years, also puts down the idea that everyone they meet is an actor. \"The frequency of the general public to say hello is increasing but still there isn't that much interaction. Communication does happen with younger people who have English fluency, older people or people who have been drinking,\" he added. \"Quite often when you go to a park, people might come over and say hello.

Parents are usually the first to show off pictures of their kids, but that role has been reversed in a new breed of style blogs in which children submit nostalgic and stylish photos of their parents from back in the day. Blogs like My Mom, the Style Icon, My Parents Were Awesome  and Dads in Short Shorts allow proud children to submit nostalgic pictures of their parents to put on display for the world. \"Similar to the way that young people look to celebrities as style icons, more people are looking to these attainable vintage fashions from their parents and there is a growing population of people who prefer these classic looks,\" said Margot Nason, editor of the trend forecasting newsletter Trend Central. What is so unique about these blogs is that the photos celebrate just how cool today's offspring think their parents are. Rather than laughing or cringing at old photos of their folks, today's children want everyone to see their parents in their heyday. Newspaper editor Piper Weiss got the idea for My Mom, the Style Icon when she was rifling through her mother's closet in search of vintage clothes to steal for her own wardrobe. \"I began using pictures of her before I was born as a guide to my own style because I figured whatever looked good on her when she was young would look good on me now,\" said Weiss, 31. \"I discovered a photo album of pictures of her before she met my dad and she was so heart-stoppingly gorgeous I wanted to share them with everyone I knew. I started the blog with pictures of my mom and then people's own submissions started rolling in.\" Since the Web site has been live for a little more than a month, Weiss has received several hundred submissions of parent pictures from folks who want to memorialize their mom and dad's most stylish years on the Internet. During a recession, folks are more likely to indulge in the kind of nostalgia these old pictures evoke. \"Times of uncertainty make you long for the past, and the nostalgia of these pictures makes people feel safe,\" said Samantha Marcus Yanks, editor-in-chief of Gotham and Hamptons magazines. \"And a bit of nostalgia is inspirational in fashion these days, because it seems more affordable.\" The Web site Dads in Short Shorts, started by marketing manager Tara Eisenberg, 26, and painter Annie Kyle, 26, has a genesis similar to My Mom, the Style Icon. \"On a summer road trip we were looking through an old photo album and discovered a shot of a dad in bright yellow shorts mixed in with seemingly normal family photos,\" Eisenberg said. \"The mom claimed the shot was an 'accident' and that she was just 'testing the camera.' Upon further investigation, we noticed a lot of our friends had similar 'accidents' in their old photo albums, and thus the blog was born.\" Dads in Short Shorts has had more the 50 submissions of dads wearing above the knee pants, with more pouring in every day. How do parents feel about being exposed in all their youthful glory and occasional fashion disasters on the Internet for all to see? \"The blog is great fun for me and the nostalgia is a trip,\" said Marilyn Weiss about her debut on My Mom, the Style Icon. \"Not many guests want to sit down and see your old photos.

International efforts to crack down on drug producers and consumers and to try to reduce demand have had \"devastating consequences for individuals and societies around the world,\" the report from the Global Commission on Drug Policy said. The commission, which includes former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, challenges the conventional wisdom about drug markets and drug use. Among the group's recommendations: . -- End of criminalization and stigmatization of people who use drugs but do not harm others . -- Encourage governments to experiment with drug legalization, especially marijuana . -- Offer more harm reduction measures, such as access to syringes . -- Ditch \"just say no\" and \"zero tolerance\" policies for youth in favor of other educational efforts. The theory that increasing law enforcement action would lead to a shrinking drug market has not worked, the report says. To the contrary, illegal drug markets and the organized criminal organizations that traffic them have grown, the group found. The report comes as countries such as Mexico suffer from widespread drug-related violence. More than 40,000 people have been killed in Mexico in the past four years as rival cartels battle each other over lucrative smuggling corridors and as the army fights the cartels. The commission's findings add more high-profile voices to a growing movement calling for a radical approach to drugs. Other leaders, such as former Mexican President Vicente Fox, have called for drug legalization as part of a solution to his country's woes.\n### Response : ", "target": "Group suggests legalization, access to syringes, new education programs .\nIncreasing law enforcement has not worked, group says .\nMore than 40,000 people have been killed in Mexico's drug war in the past four years .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Produce an article summary of the following news article:Doc to summarize:(CNN) -- Australian scientists have dated a star thought to be the oldest yet discovered, and it's right in our neighborhood -- astronomically speaking. The star, which has been given the name SMSS J031300.36-670839.3, is thought by a team of astronomers at the Australia National University to be 13.6 billion years old. The star itself is not a new discovery -- it is faintly visible on existing photographic maps of the southern sky. But the recent dating places it as older than any other celestial body previously found. The star is part of our Milky Way galaxy and only around 6,000 light years from Earth, relatively close in astronomical terms. Stefan Keller, a research fellow at ANU's Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, published the findings in the scientific journal Nature. \"Stars act as time capsules,\" Keller told CNN. \"This one took a little sample of the universe at the time that is was formed ... and means we can study [what the early universe was like] in great detail.\" The discovery of the star's age -- which dates it at only a hundred million years younger than scientific estimates of the age of the universe itself -- is significantly older than any previously dated stars. The oldest celestial bodies discovered thus far have been 13.2 billion years old. Keller and his team used the SkyMapper telescope to find ancient stars as part of an ongoing project to produce the first digital map of the southern sky. The team used a technique for imaging stars to ascertain how much iron was present -- the younger a star, the greater the amounts of iron it had. The SkyMapper telescope is unique in its ability to find stars with low iron, which uses sophisticated filters to measure the color of the stars, a key indicator of iron levels. \"The stars we are finding number one in a million,\" said team member Mike Bessell on the University's website. The team looked at 60 million stars and narrowed down potential candidates to a shortlist of 200, which were examined using the Magellan telescope in Chile. It is an important cosmological discovery, as it tells researchers a great deal about the origin of the elements that make up the universe. Keller said that most stars created in the early stages of the universe died in \"extremely violent explosions,\" and that it is unlikely that more stars of a similar age will be found.\n### Response:", "target": "A 13.6 billion-year-old star has been dated by Australian astronomers .\nThe discovery of star's age makes it the oldest celestial body ever found .\nThe team used a unique technique for dating stars, based on the amount of iron present .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction :Can you give me a quick rundown?\n### Input: (CNN) -- An estimated 125,000 Western lowland gorillas are living in a swamp in equatorial Africa, researchers reported Tuesday, double the number of the endangered primates thought to survive worldwide. Forest clearings draw large numbers of Western lowland gorillas searching for food. \"It's pretty astonishing,\" Hugo Rainey, one of the researchers who conducted the survey for the U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society, told CNN Tuesday. The last census on the species, carried out during the 1980s, estimated that there were only 100,000 of the gorillas left worldwide. Since then, the researchers estimated, the numbers had been cut in half. WCS survey teams conducted the research in 2006 and 2007, traveling to the remote Lac Tele Community Reserve in northern Republic of Congo, a vast area of swamp forest. Acting on a tip from hunters who indicated the presence of gorillas, Rainey said that the researchers trekked on foot through mud for three days to the outskirts of Lac Tele, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the nearest road. \"When we went there, we found an astonishing amount of gorillas,\" said Rainey, speaking from the International Primatological Society Congress in Edinburgh, Scotland. Though researchers did spot some gorillas, they based their estimate on the number of gorilla nests found at the site, Rainey said. Each gorilla makes a nest to sleep in at night. \"This is the highest-known density of gorillas that's ever been found,\" Rainey said.  Watch a glimpse of gorilla life in African swamp \u00bb . Western lowland gorillas are listed as critically endangered, the highest threat category for a species. Their populations are declining rapidly because of hunting and diseases like Ebola hemorrhagic fever, whose symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting and internal and external bleeding.  Take a closer look at the Western lowland gorilla \u00bb . While the discovery in northern Congo indicates that the gorilla population remains stable in some areas, it is likely that gorillas will remain critically endangered because the threats facing the species are so great, Rainey said. iReport.com: Share photos and video of gorillas in zoos or the wild . \"We know very little about Ebola and how it spreads,\" he said. \"We don't even know the animal that spreads it around.\" The goal now, Rainey said, is to work with the Congolese government and donors to protect the areas in which the gorillas are known to be living. Western lowland gorillas, which are found in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Nigeria as well as the Republic of Congo, are the most numerous and wide-ranging of the four gorilla subspecies, each of which is threatened by extinction, the WCS says.  See where the gorillas live \u00bb . Illegal hunting and habitat loss have also threatened the Cross River gorillas, found in the highlands of Cameroon and Nigeria. Only about 250 to 300 are estimated to remain in the world, the WCS says. War, habitat loss, poaching and disease are the major threats to the mountain gorillas, made famous by researcher Dian Fossey and the film \"Gorillas in the Mist.\" The mountain gorilla population is starting to recover after decades of conservation work. From a population of around 230 in the 1970s, the mountain gorillas now number around 700, the WCS says. Poaching and war have also threatened populations of Grauer's gorillas in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the former Zaire. The WCS estimates their population to be around 16,000. News of the discovery of the Western lowland gorillas in northern Congo comes the same week as a report that almost 50 percent of the world's primates are in danger of extinction.  Watch what gorilla expert thinks of find \u00bb . The report, also delivered to the Edinburgh conference, cites habitat loss and hunting as the greatest threats. The situation is especially dire in Asia, where the report says more than 70 percent of monkeys, apes, and other primates are classified as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered.

The system was expected to dump up at least 4 inches in Pittsburgh beginning Tuesday evening as it moved toward the District of Columbia and Baltimore, which braced for potentially significant accumulations, according to the National Weather Service. Chicago's O'Hare International Airport had 6 inches of snow by Tuesday afternoon, besting a 1999 record for the date by 2.2 inches. It was the first 6-inch snowfall in the Windy City since the Groundhog Day blizzard of 2011, the National Weather Service said. United Airlines said about 650 flights systemwide for Wednesday were canceled, most to and from Dulles International Airport near Washington. \"They will try to get as many aircraft out of Dulles today (Tuesday) as possible so they are not sitting in a snow storm,\" United spokeswoman Megan McCarthy told CNN. \"This helps speed up the resumption of flights after the storm is passed. \" Track the late-winter storm . U.S. Airways reported 350 cancellations for Wednesday, and American Airlines called off 20 flights, down from 360 on Tuesday. Southwest Airlines said it made no major adjustments for Wednesday. Delta Air Lines reported 120 cancellations on Tuesday. Airlines advised passengers to check their flight status before heading to airports. O'Hare canceled 900 flights on Tuesday and reported delays, while Chicago's other major airport, Midway, canceled 240 flights, according to the city's aviation department. The storm deposited heavy snow on portions of the Ohio Valley and upper Midwest on Tuesday. By midafternoon Tuesday, Lake City, Minnesota, had been blanketed with 11.5 inches of snow since Sunday morning. New Hampton, Iowa, had 8.6 inches and the level stood at 15 inches in Langdon, North Dakota. The storm will intensify in the mid-Atlantic and parts of the Northeast on Wednesday, said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen, with a rain-snow line from Washington to Boston. West of the line will see significant snowfall, particularly in the higher elevations of Virginia, Maryland and West Virginia. One weather model predicts that the snow won't make it to the District of Columbia, said CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera. Another says Washington, Philadelphia and Boston could see a foot of snow. The Washington suburb of Alexandria, Virginia, is prepared to deploy scores of trucks and snow plows, CNN's Weather Center said. Washington and Baltimore were under a winter storm warning Tuesday evening. Arlington National Cemetery put in place inclement weather plans for Wednesday. Amtrak said it expected to operate as scheduled Wednesday. Interstate 95, connecting the capital with Philadelphia, could see heavy snow, the weather service warned. Severe weather hit Gordon County, Georgia, on Tuesday afternoon, more than a month after a fierce system caused widespread damage in the area. Officials reported downed power lines, trees and damage to homes, said Cpl. Andrew York of the county's dispatch center. About 10 homes were damaged, officials told CNN.

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.\n### Input:(CNN)  -- An organization of Christian physicians argued Wednesday against an impending rollback of a federal rule allowing health care workers to refuse to provide certain reproductive services, saying it's discriminatory. The rule protects the rights of health care providers who refuse to participate in certain procedures. The Bush White House proposed the rule in August, and it was enacted January 20, the day President Obama took office. It expanded on a 30-year-old law establishing a \"conscience clause\" for health care professionals who don't want to perform abortions. Under the rule, workers in health care settings -- from doctors to janitors -- can refuse to provide services, information or advice to patients on subjects such as contraception, family planning, blood transfusions and even vaccine counseling if they are morally against it. The Obama administration is expected to reverse the rule shortly, touching off a new wave of heated debate over what remains one of the most sensitive and emotional hot-button issues in American politics. \" 'Right of conscience' is under attack, and that is dangerous for our country, our health care system and our patients,\" said Dr. David Stevens, head of the 15,000-member Christian Medical Association. \"When the state demands that we surrender our conscience, it becomes totalitarian and dangerous. Do we want our professional schools to ethically neuter doctors of all moral convictions that are not approved by the government?\"  Watch CNN's Sanjay Gupta discuss the 'conscience clause' \u00bb . Stevens was speaking on behalf of Freedom to Care, an umbrella organization of 36 groups working to prevent a rollback of the rule.  Watch why one pharmacist says the \"conscience clause\" is needed \u00bb . Many health care organizations, including the American Medical Association, believe that health care providers have an obligation to their patients to advise them of the options despite their own beliefs. And critics of the current rule argue that there are laws on the books protecting health-care professionals when it comes to refusing care for personal reasons. \"We don't make God-like decisions. ... That's not what it's about for us. It's about helping the patient make their own decision. ... No one appointed us to be the ultimate person to pass judgment,\" said Mary Jean Schumann, a member of the American Nurses Association. Dr. Suzanne T. Poppema, board chairwoman of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health, praised Obama \"for placing good health care above ideological demands.\" \"Physicians across the country were outraged when the Bush administration, in its final days, limited women's access to reproductive health care,\" she said. \"Hundreds of doctors protested these midnight regulations and urged President Obama to repeal them quickly. We are thrilled that President Obama [is taking steps] to ensure that our patients' health is once again protected.\" Stevens argued that there is \"a well-funded and increasingly successful effort to discriminate against health care professionals based upon their deeply held religious and moral beliefs.\" Rescinding the rule will send \"a clear message,\" he said: \"It's open season on health care professionals of conscience. Discriminate at will. If anyone should understand the ugliness of discrimination, it is our first African-American president.\" Stevens predicted that a large number of specialists in obstetrics and gynecology would leave the medical profession if the rule is repealed. A final announcement from the Obama administration is expected with the conclusion of a 30-day public comment period on the proposed rule change. \"We do not want to impose new limitations on services that would allow providers to refuse to provide to women and their families services like family planning and contraception that would actually help prevent the need for an abortion in the first place,\" a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official said in February.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?ENLARGE Dallas Mavericks' Jae Crowder watches as referee Bill Kennedy makes a call in last season\u2019s playoffs. Associated Press \n  \n NBA referees have been scrutinized over the years for every imaginable bias. Now, though, new research has whistled another trait that may shape how refs call games: their height. \n  \n As it turns out, the league\u2019s shorter referee crews call more fouls than its taller officiating teams, according to a Journal of Sports Economics study by Paul Gift and Ryan Rodenberg that examined more than 4,000 regular-season games over four recent NBA seasons. \n  \n The study builds on a body of studies that has emerged since the 2007 Tim Donaghy officiating scandal. Before the researchers could do anything, though, they had to calculate each referee\u2019s height. This was trickier than it sounds. The heights of players are meticulously recorded, of course, but referee height isn\u2019t public information. \n  \n ENLARGE \n  \n To gather their data, the authors interviewed a former NBA referee for his recollections, reviewed clips of game film and examined photographs to measure officials when they were standing next to players with known heights. \n  \n Then they split NBA crews into three tiers: 6 feet and under, 6 feet to 6 feet 3 and 6 feet 3 and taller. What they found was that each additional inch per crew resulted in .017 fewer personal fouls per 48 minutes. That means the shortest crew, at 8 2/3 inches shorter than the tallest crew, calls .147 fouls more per game, or a 3.6% increase from the league average. \n  \n A spokesman for the NBA said the league was aware of the study months ago and reviews outside research \u201cto see if there is anything we can learn about our staff and target areas of improvement.\u201d But the league dismissed this paper, he said, since its findings \u201care based on limited information about the average heights of individuals in crews, seemingly arbitrary height groups and no information about the actual caller.\u201d \n  \n So what could possibly explain this discrepancy? The authors have two theories. The first is that referee vantage points differ by their heights. It\u2019s possible that shorter referee crews are actually calling better games than their taller peers. \n  \n The other theory is more speculative\u2014and more exciting to think about. They hypothesize it could have something to do with a so-called Napoleon complex in professional referees. That, they say, is grounds for future research with a different focus: technical fouls. \u201cOne\u2019s height vantage point should play no role in technical foul calls,\u201d they write. \u201cBut aggressive, controlling behavior via the Napoleon complex may.\u201d ||||| A new study in the Journal of Sports Economics finds that shorter NBA refs may call more fouls, in an excellent manifestation of the Napoleon Complex. Paul Gift and Ryan Rodenberg looked at 4,463 regular season games from 2008 to 2012, and\u2014controlling for variables like race and experience*\u2014found a relationship between the average heights of three-man refereeing crew and the foul rate (per 48 minutes) of the players they officiated. \n  \n Splitting the officiating crews into three height groups, Gift and Rodenberg posted these results: \n  \n  \n  \n 6' 0'' and under 6' 0'' to 6' 3'' 6'3'' and over p-value Personal fouls/48 4.13 4.09 4.03 0.03 FT attempted/48 4.86 4.79 4.68 0.01 FT made/48 3.71 3.65 3.56 0.00 \n  \n This isn't a large effect\u2014an average player would have around one more foul every 480 minutes if the crew's average height was under 6 feet instead of over 6-foot-3\u2014but it's statistically valid . The researchers' ANOVA analysis also looked at other stats like rebounds, field goals, and blocks, but nothing else had a significant link (p < 0.05) to the height of the ref crew. \n  \n Advertisement \n  \n The researchers had to reconstruct the refs' heights themselves and did not list them individually. Joey Crawford is definitely shorter than 6 feet, though. \n  \n *All of the controlled variables: Player height, age, position, starting status, and whether they're home or away; ref age, officiating experience, basketball experience, level of education, race, and \"quality,\" as judged by an independent ranking system similar to the NBA's own internal tracking. \n  \n Sponsored \n  \n [Journal of Sports Economics] |||||\n### Response: ", "target": "\u2013 NBA players be warned: If you've got a team of referees on the short side, you may want to keep your play extra clean. A study finds that shorter groups of refs are more likely to call fouls than are their taller counterparts, the Wall Street Journal reports. Researchers examined 4,463 games between 2008 and 2012, Deadspin reports. They divided refs into three groups: those under six feet tall, those between six feet and six-foot-three, and those taller than that. The investigators found that the under-six-foot group called .147 more fouls per game than did the tallest group. That's 3.6% more fouls than the NBA average, the Journal adds. Still, as Deadspin notes, it's not a huge effect: \"An average player would have around one more foul every 480 minutes\" given a short crew. Researchers offer two possible explanations for their findings: Maybe shorter refs actually see more of what's going on between players, and they make their calls accordingly. Or maybe the refs are exhibiting \"aggressive, controlling behavior via the Napoleon complex.\" But the NBA isn't particularly moved by the findings, which, the league says, \"are based on limited information about the average heights of individuals in crews, seemingly arbitrary height groups, and no information about the actual caller.\" (As for that supposed complex, researchers this year suggested \"short man syndrome\" does exist.)", "origin": "multi_news.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction: Can you give me the gist of this text?Washington (CNN) -- Take a look at the more diverse slate of potential 2016 Republican presidential contenders and one thing becomes quite clear: this is not your daddy's GOP -- at the top anyway. There are Latino Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas. There is an Indian American: Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. And joining Jindal, Rubio and Cruz from the Generation X ranks are Gov. Scott Walker and Rep. Paul Ryan, both of Wisconsin. Boomers potentially in the mix include Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Sen. Rand Paul of Texas and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Three out of the past four Republican nominees were all well into their 60s, while the Democrats over the same period went with younger candidates. Now look: . Democrats are taking a page from Ronald Reagan, the oldest president ever on Inauguration Day at 69. Hillary Clinton would be that age on Election Day 2016, if she runs and wins, while Vice President Joe Biden might be considered historically \"young\" for a senator at 73 at the same point, but breaking new ground for the Oval Office. Both are quite pale, too, and so is most of \"the bench\" of the party that embraced history in 2008 and nominated the first African American for President in Barack Obama, who was at the time merely in his 40s. GOP race for 2016 is wide open . \"Democrats are known as having great policies (for minorities) on paper, but it's harder to rise through the ranks,\" said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. \"The Republicans don't have great policies on paper, but they are often more supportive of their minority candidates.\" Obama's election meant that many of the Democratic old guard, folks like Clinton and Biden, had to bide their time and wait until the next cycle. But his time around people like Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick are barely a consideration, she said. \"If you want to present something different, young, charismatic black guy isn't it,\" Gillespie said. The Republican Party was blasted during the 2012 presidential election as the party of old, white, men for their presidential and congressional candidate lineups. The GOP lost among young people, minorities and women in large numbers and was forced to do some serious soul searching in preparation for the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential elections. GOP problem: 'Their voters are white, aging and dying off' But even as the Republican Party was taking a beating over its lack of diversity and tin ear on issues important to minorities, a class of young guns who more closely resembled the broader American electorate made headlines for their edgier brand of conservatism. \"These candidates have been very shrewd and extremely media savvy and have been able to garner a lot of attention very quickly,\" Gillespie said. \"It's partly their own skill and being in the right place at the right time. But it's also the Republican Party not wanting to look like the party of old white men.\" As a tea party darling, Rubio has earned nods from conservative corners for his criticism of Obamacare, but is also seen as a more moderate voice in the debate over immigration reform. Cruz and Paul rode that same anti-establishment, tea party wave into Congress and have since garnered attention for their fiery rhetoric about the ills of big government and willingness to challenge the status quo. Christie rose to prominence because of his swaggering conservative style tempered by his willingness to reach across the aisle in his state. He made a splash, too, by giving Obama and his administration credit on Superstorm Sandy recovery efforts. Meanwhile, Santorum, Ryan, Jindal and Walker's clear and direct conservative approach to fiscal and governance matters is seen in right wing circles as a refreshing change from what some in the Republican Party have felt is a watered down version. \"The fact that the Democrats don't have the depth of diverse talent like the Republicans do might be an indication that, despite what they might have you believe, their party is old and stale,\" said Orlando Watson, the Republican National Committee communications director for black media. RNC highlights strategy for building 'new generation of black Republicans' The slate of potential 2016 GOP presidential hopefuls\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand to be clear, no one on either side of the aisle has officially announced a bid\u00e2\u20ac\u201dmay be younger and more diverse. But the broader party is still too old, too white and too out of touch with the rest of America, said Lionel Sosa, a veteran Latino GOP strategist who has helped advise candidates since 1980. \"I think our party is stone deaf on the issue of Latinos and immigration. We're turning off not only Latinos, but also women, young people and Asians with stupid, intensive comments,\" Sosa said. He pointed to anti-immigration comments by recent Republican candidates and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's comments about Democrats thinking women \"can't control their libidos\" as \"equally stupid.\" \"GOP candidates who cater to the extreme right in the primaries, don't realize the long term damage they're doing to the Republican brand in terms of alienating the segment of voters who are growing the fastest,\" Sosa said. \"This damage will be hard to overcome in the general election.\"\n### Response:", "target": "In the 2016 election, the GOP could present a more diverse cadre of presidential hopefuls .\nBy contrast, the presumed Democratic likely frontrunners are older and white .\nGOP focused on diversity after it lost big among minorities in 2012 .\nThough their candidates are diverse, the party still has work to do in minority voter outreach .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Outside, the water was more than waist deep, roads were clogged with debris, and one of their team members, Mark Thomas, had a deep gash to his leg, inflicted by a jagged piece of sheet metal that sliced into him, unseen beneath the swirling water. \"On Saturday we realized we needed to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible, mostly because of Mark's leg,\" said James Reynolds, founder of Earth Uncut Productions. He and Thomas were joined by Josh Morgerman, who runs iCyclone.com, a storm chasing site from the U.S. When the typhoon hit they were working with CNN anchor Andrew Stevens and producer Tim Schwarz. Super Typhoon Haiyan struck the capital of Leyte province in the eastern Philippines early Friday morning, creating \"blinding rain, absolutely ferocious winds (and) deafening sounds,\" Reynolds said. \"Windows were blowing out, water was cascading down the staircases in the hotel, flooding all the rooms.\" After a couple of hours, the storm surge hit, flooding the hotel's ground floor before conditions eased enough to venture outside. Dazed survivors with cuts and bruises searched for anything they could salvage beneath the wreck of their homes. However, Reynolds said on day two, some were raiding abandoned shops for food and water. Pharmacies were being targeted, presumably for medication. He also saw some people carrying electrical appliances, useless in a town without electricity and covered in water. \"People in the Philippines are great and they're tough and they're good at fending for themselves. But the problem is in a situation like that, the more desperate people become for food and water, the more desperate their actions become,\" he said. A sense of foreboding was starting to set in, Reynolds said, as people started to realize that everything they had and knew had been wiped out. \"In the immediate aftermath I got the sense that a lot of people didn't quite realize how serious the situation was and how badly it would escalate,\" he said. \"Whilst we didn't personally feel threatened you could just sense it wouldn't take much.\" \"I remember at one point looking at the security guard in the hotel and it wasn't because of any specific threat, but he had his gun in his hand, and he looked like he was anxious and preparing himself for something, and that was unnerving for me.\" Back at their flooded hotel, the team planned a way to get out. They'd chosen the Alejandro Hotel because of its height -- at four stories it was one of the tallest buildings in Tacloban and they could see the airport from the roof. OPEN STORY: Haiyan's impact . They could also see kilometer after kilometer of flattened buildings and debris covering roads turning what is normally a six to seven kilometer car ride to the airport into potentially a seven-hour trek over collapsed buildings and trees. They were in their hotel room when they heard planes fly overhead. \"We rushed out of the room, sprinted up to the roof and watched the planes fly over the city. We were begging them, 'please land, please,' because we didn't know the state of the airport. When we saw one of the planes land, we thought, right, ok the airport's a viable option.\" Reynolds and Morgerman set out, leaving an injured Thomas back at the hotel. They had handheld radios and within half an hour a call came from Thomas. He'd learned of another way out: a military staging post where the airforce was flying people out. iREPORT: Looking for loved ones . \"It was so uncertain -- we didn't want to give up our hotel room and food supplies because if we got to the staging post and they said sorry we couldn't help you we would have been in big trouble,\" Reynolds said. Leaving behind most of their belongings, they carried the bare minimum to the military checkpoint where they registered their names and were told: \"Yes, you can get out on an air force flight but you have to make your own way to their airport.\" At that moment, a man Reynolds describes only as a general piped up: \"There is a helicopter coming, come with me.\" \"We ran with him,\" Reynolds said. \"The chopper landed and we scrambled onto it and got ferried to the airport.\" From there they boarded a C-130 with other survivors, and the bagged corpses of four people who didn't make it. They landed in Cebu and caught flights out of the Philippines. Thomas is currently being treated in hospital in Taipei. Back in Hong Kong, Reynolds said it was clear the people of Tacloban had no idea of what was coming. \"The Philippines isn't used to getting storm surges -- it's not usually such of an issue so this would have caught people by surprise. They don't associate typhoons with the rising water levels like that.\" The day before, his team had bought enough food and water for one week.

{"source": "### Instruction:Could you highlight the primary messages?(CNN) -- Even as America reels from the horrific massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, the clock continues to count down toward the so-called \"fiscal cliff.\" In the face of a legitimate crisis, it is harder to stomach manufactured ones. And that's exactly what the so-called fiscal cliff is. In fact, every time I hear the term, I want to slam my head on the table. Luckily, I'm not alone. Today, December 19, a collection of artists are coming together to expose the \"fiscal cliff\" as a \"fiscal bluff,\" and remind progressives of the power of culture in helping to win the long-term war of ideas. My organization, Rebuild the Dream, is joining artist groups CultureStrike and 5D Stories on a special project: \"ARTSTRIKE: America's Not Broke, America is Being Robbed.\" On Wednesday, with the help of Rebuild the Dream's members and partners, millions of people will see works of art that convey what is at stake in the big budget fight. Some of the artwork takes the form of arresting and powerful visuals with a fierce message. Other works explain what is happening in Washington, or graphically depict the choice our nation faces. There are songs and videos touching on issues from student debt to long-ignored poverty. Not every piece frames the debate exactly as I would, and I may not share every artist's exact view. But that's not the point of a project like this. I believe this project conveys a message that policymakers need to hear. And it couldn't come at a more urgent moment than now, as reports indicate President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner could be nearing a deal that slashes Social Security, cuts benefits for veterans and raises taxes on the poor and middle class to pay for the Bush wars, tax cuts and bailouts. Our country is in the midst of a massive jobs crisis, the next generation is saddled in debt, the climate crisis is rapidly approaching a point of no return and now unspeakable gun violence shatters the heart of our nation. Instead of tackling these problems, some of our nation's leaders are apparently contemplating putting Social Security, and maybe Medicare, on the chopping block in a panic move -- all to avoid an artificially contrived deadline. We can make a huge dent in the rest of the deficit just by returning to the higher taxes and lower defense spending of the Clinton boom years, asking those who do well in America to do well by America. Washington should also deal with spending by cutting wasteful subsidies to oil companies, defense contractors and agribusinesses that do little but line CEOs' pockets with our tax dollars. The main part of the cliff that worries me is taxes going up on poor and middle-class Americans. The House of Representatives could fix that with one vote to extend the current low rates. We need to spread the word, and I am glad that artists are leading the way. Artists have been at the forefront of all great modern social movements. They inspire people to dream bigger, force us to imagine a different world and confront people with new ideas. We must embrace the power of art to better protect the American Dream for generations to come. We should never allow Washington politicians to stampede the American people into supporting cuts they otherwise would never accept. They're bluffing -- and hoping we fold. It's not a fiscal cliff, it's a fiscal bluff. And as our nation struggles to deal with real emergencies, I am glad that America's artists are calling them on it. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Van Jones.\n### Response: ", "target": "Van Jones: After Newtown, it is hard to stomach an artificial crisis like the fiscal cliff .\nJones: Artists' works expose fiscal cliff as a bluff to cut essential programs .\nJones: We need a return to higher taxes, lower defense spending of Clinton years .\nListen to artists, he says.

{"source": "### Instruction: How would you encapsulate this?(CNN) -- As you can imagine, college life can be very eventful. Balancing classes, internships, and a life away from home is enough to keep anyone busy. As a 20-year-old living with a chronic illness, I have skillfully learned the balancing act of college life. My name is Marquita Gaines, and I have sickle cell disease. I was first diagnosed at birth. The doctors performed a newborn screening test and when I was 10 days old they called to inform my mom. Because she and my father both have the sickle cell trait, she was aware that I may have the disease. At the age of 8 months I began having fevers over 101 consistently for a year. When I was 5 years old, I was riding the new bike I had just gotten for Christmas when I fell off and the handle bars hit me in the ribcage. That night I began having difficulty breathing. I was rushed to the local hospital and within hours I had stopped breathing. I was moved to intensive care, revived, and placed on a respirator. The critical care doctors and the hematologist worked day and night to figure out what was happening to me. My health continued to decline, and my parents were told to go pray because if I continued to not receive enough oxygen I would only have two hours to live. Around the seventh day, my condition stabilized and it was learned that I was suffering from an acute chest syndrome, a condition common among sickle cell patients. Shooting survivor says blood donations saved her life . Sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder affecting the red blood cells. It causes the cells to lose oxygen very easily, turning them from round shapes to crescent shapes that cause painful episodes known as pain crises. At first glance, no one would know that I am a patient living with sickle cell disease. On any given day I can feel great, but I never know when the pain will come or how long it will last. A pain crisis can cause severe pain in my joints, my bones and my muscles. Sometimes it lasts for hours or even for days. At my worst it is difficult to walk and I have to use a wheelchair. To help reduce the number and severity of these episodes, I take daily medications and, with the help of the American Red Cross, I receive red blood cell transfusions every six weeks. The first time I received donor blood from the American Red Cross, I was in the 11th grade. I arrived on an outpatient basis, and a trained nurse from the American Red Cross came to administer the procedure. I was nervous, but the possibility of having little to no pain was exciting. First, my blood was typed and cross-matched with donor blood. Then, with my family by my side, the transfusion began. A machine filtered out my sickled red blood cells in exchange for roughly 10 pints of normal red blood cells. The American Red Cross nurse administering the transfusion was very knowledgeable and friendly, which helped me remain calm. Everything was a success, and within a week and a half I felt like a brand new person! My bones no longer ached and I was able to stop taking the heavy pain medication. Once my senior year began, I was able to attend school more often. I also was able to run the mile in eight minutes with the rest of the gym class -- and I wasn't the last person to finish! Cancer survivor's challenge: Give the gift of life this season . Now in my junior year at Howard University, I am still managing school work and my illness. I am involved in campus life as a member of student government and other organizations. I am young and full of life, with many goals and aspirations. The American Red Cross provides the opportunity for me to feel better more often. Transfusions allow me to have an easier, pain-free life. During this holiday season, my hope is that everyone will realize the importance of being a blood donor. For people like me who need regular transfusions, blood is often best matched among people of the same ethnic group, so donations from anyone who is a minority or has a rare blood type such as U- or Fy(a-b-) are especially important. You could help someone like me live a healthier, happier, pain-free life. I am a testament to the importance of blood donation and the services that the American Red Cross provides on a daily basis. Without both I wouldn't be able to be a happy and successful young lady. I realize that sickle cell disease is a part of me, but it will never define who I am. With treatments like this and a strong support system, which I have from my family and the American Red Cross, there is no excuse not to succeed with this disease.

But now you can add \"beans\" to that list. The Jelly Bean Factory -- a father-and-son start-up -- is defying a difficult Irish economic climate with a turnover of 11 million euros ($14.6 million) a year. The sweet maker is refining the art of gourmet confectionery, teaming up with corporate giants including GlaxoSmithKline to produce specially designed jelly beans. Richard Cullen, managing director of The Jelly Bean Factory, told CNN: \"We make their energy sports beans under the brand Lucozade, we also partner with a Finnish company called Panda and we sell that into the Finnish market and also into the U.S. market.\" The business, founded in 1998 by father Peter Cullen and son Richard, produces 12 million jelly beans a day and exports the sugary treats to more than 55 countries worldwide. The company expects growth to double over the next two years. Before the financial crisis of 2008, Ireland's economy was known as the \"Celtic Tiger\" due to its rapid economic expansion and property boom. Cullen said: \"Setting up manufacturing in Ireland at the height of the Celtic Tiger was a challenge in itself - just trying to find a property that we could afford was difficult, but then finding a workforce in those early stages was very difficult as well.\" The Celtic Tiger stumbled after Ireland's banking crisis and the collapse of its construction sector. A member of the 17-nation single currency, Ireland is now undergoing a harsh austerity program and grappling with high unemployment. And as one of the three member states to receive financial aid from the eurozone's rescue funds, Ireland is also is also trying to repay a 67 billion euro ($89 billion) bailout to creditors. But despite the country's economic woes and the problems plaguing the eurozone, Cullen believes Ireland's place in the 27-nation European Union is \"definitely\" helping the business. Food regulation within the EU is tight but the Jelly Bean Factory is meticulous in its production. It takes two weeks to craft each of the individual 36 flavours, from Cranberry and apple to Belgian chocolate. Cullen told CNN: \"We transformed our business; we only use natural colours and natural flavours, so we don't have to put any health warnings on our products.\" CNN's Oliver Joy contributed to this report.\n### Response : ", "target": "The Jelly Bean Factory has a turnover of 11 million euros ($14.6 million) a year .\nThe sweet maker expects the company to double its growth over the next two years .\nManaging Director Richard Cullen believes Ireland's EU status is helping the company .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Stars Gabourey Sidibe and Mo'Nique were both recognized for their portrayals of a mother and daughter in a dysfunctional relationship, with a best female lead nomination for newcomer Sidibe and a best supporting female nomination for Mo'Nique. The film's success is not entirely a surprise, considering that the Oprah Winfrey- and Tyler Perry-backed Sundance darling has earned $27 million at the domestic box office and was received well by audiences during its slow rollout in cities across the nation in November. Sidibe's work in \"Precious\" has been one of the breakout roles of the year, and the young actress is rumored to be the star of a new series, \"The C Word.\" However, it hasn't been all smooth for \"Precious\": The film earned zero nominations for the Gotham Independent Film Awards, which were given out Monday night. The Gotham awards are a New York-based indie film honor. \"The Hurt Locker,\" by contrast, took home two Gotham awards Monday night, one for best picture and the other for best ensemble. There were no Independent Spirit Award nominations for this Iraq war drama, however, as it was nominated last year. For the Spirits, \"Precious\" is facing off against the Zooey Deschanel-driven \"(500) Days of Summer,\" \"Amreeka,\" \"The Last Station\" and \"Sin Nombre\" for best picture. \"Summer\" also snagged a nomination for best male lead, a nod for Joseph Gordon-Levitt. On top of the best picture nomination, \"The Last Station\" -- a biographical piece about Leo Tolstoy featuring James McAvoy, Helen Mirren and Paul Giamatti -- is up for best director, best screenplay, best female lead and best supporting male lead.

The company has told the government it will sign legal documents Monday agreeing to pay the maximum civil penalty of $16.375 million, according to the official, who was not authorized to speak for attribution because the agreement has not been announced. Toyota would then have 30 days to pay the fine. This official added that an agreement does not release Toyota from any potential criminal liability or civil liability related to the sticky-pedal defect. The Transportation Department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sought the fine after it learned, through documents obtained from Toyota, that the automaker knew of sticky gas pedal problems since at least September last year, the agency said this month. Under federal regulations, automakers are required to inform the agency within five days of determining that a safety defect exists in one of its products. \"By paying the full civil penalty, Toyota is accepting responsibility for hiding this safety defect from NHTSA in violation of the law\" the senior DOT official said Sunday. Toyota cars and trucks have been the subject of at least three separate major recalls in the past year. One was for the \"sticky pedal\" situation in which gas pedals, as they age, begin to stick in a partially depressed position. Another was for gas pedals that can stick on some floor mats, and a third was for braking problems on Toyota Prius hybrid cars. The largest fine levied to date by the government on an automaker was nearly $1 million taken from General Motors in 2004 for failing to deal promptly with a windshield-wiper issue, an amount that was negotiated down from the $3 million originally sought by NHTSA.\n### Response :", "target": "U.S. official: Toyota indicates it will pay a $16.4 million fine .\nPenalty assessed for failing to notify over \"sticky pedal\" defect .\nToyota vehicles have been the subject of at least 3 separate recalls in past year .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

CNN journalist and avid Instagram user Jethro Mullen has racked up nearly 800,000 followers on the app. Here are his tips for getting the best out of your phone camera when you travel. 1. Get high . Everything looks better, or at least different, when seen from above. Viewing platforms, sky bars, cable car rides and overhead walkways are great for expansive perspectives. If you're shooting through a window, get your lens as close to the glass as possible to reduce unwanted light reflections. 2. Learn from locals . Nobody knows a place better than the people who live there. You can discover photogenic spots in the places you're going to visit through hashtags, geotags and the feeds of local Instagram users. When I visited Atlanta last year, a photographer I knew through Instagram pointed me in the direction of the colorful staircase you can see in photo no. 2 above. 3. Be on the look out when you're on the move . Don't tune out while in transit. Architecture and human activity at airports and rail stations often provide rich photo opportunities. And the views from planes, trains and automobiles can be compelling. Window seats offer great shots. Flights from southern China to Europe can provide majestic views of mountains on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau, for example. 4. Get lost . Avoid hopping from landmark to landmark. Some of the most satisfying and memorable pictures from a trip can be those you stumble upon when exploring a less frequented area. Take some wrong turns, wander, see what you find. 5. Pack some extras . A number of gadgets allow you to get more out of your phone camera. Lens attachments, like the Olloclip, provide fisheye, wide-angle and macro options. Flexible tripods, like the GorillaPod, allow you to set up long-exposure shots using apps like Average Camera Pro and Slow Shutter Cam. Make sure you check any gear you buy is compatible with your make and model of phone. 6. Use the right apps . Native Instagram filters can undoubtedly jazz up a run-of-the-mill image. But their effects can be heavy, bludgeoning subtler elements of a photo. Editing apps like Snapseed, Afterlight (both of which I used in photo no. 6 above) and VSCO Cam allow you to tinker in a gentler manner with brightness, saturation, contrast and other aspects. I edit nearly every Instagram I take using these tools. 7. Embrace bad weather . Rain can put a dampener on a vacation, but it creates a range of appealing subjects for pictures: puddle reflections, colorful umbrellas, raindrops on windows. What's more, the sky can be at its most dynamic before and after stormy weather. To optimize puddle shots, turn your phone upside down so the lens is closer to the water's surface. 8. Plan your sunrises and sunsets . Think about where you want to be for the often rewarding light conditions at the start and end of the day. Consider how the sunlight is likely to interact with the surroundings, like trees, buildings or water. Apps like Sun Seeker can tell you the sun's predicted path through the sky. 9. Look up . In outdoor areas where your surroundings feel cramped or cluttered, try tilting your head back and seeing what lies above. In cities, clusters of skyscrapers or geometrically arranged facades work well. Natural surroundings, like forests of tall trees, can also be eye-catching.

Hushovd is the first Norwegian to win the coveted crown as he relegated Denmark's Matti Breschel and home hope Allan Davis to the minor podium positions after 262.7 kilometers of racing around Melbourne. Breschel now has a silver to add to his bronze of 2008 while Davis could not quite emulate the feat of compatriot Cadel Evans who was defending his title in front of home crowds. Hushovd, a former green jersey winner at the Tour de France and one-day classics expert, timed his charge for the line perfectly. \"It's hard to understand I've won the worlds. It's a dream, it's unreal,\" he told AFP. \"This has to be the best moment of my career.\" The race started and finished in two different locations with the last of 11 laps bringing the riders to the suburb of Geelong. Belgian Philippe Gilbert made his bid for victory on the final 15.9 km circuit and looked set to stay clear until being caught near the end by a small group of chasers, including Evans who rode brilliantly in his title defense. But in turn they were reeled in by the bunch, in which Hushovd and his teammate Edvald Boasson Hagen played their full part in bringing it back. A number of leading favorites had fallen by the wayside before the final lap, including world time trial champion Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland and Britain's sprint ace Mark Cavendish. It was the final race of a championship which have been overshadowed by the news of positive drugs tests for Tour de France champion Alberto Contador and a number of other star riders, who were not riding in Australia. Contador has been provisionally suspended by the International Cycling Union (UCI) after his positive test for traces of clenbuterol was revealed Friday. He insists he is innocent and told Spanish television on Saturday night that he was \"very optimistic\" that he will be cleared.\n### Response:", "target": "Norway's Thor Hushovd wins men's world road race title in Melbourne .\nHushovd wins bunch sprint at end of thrilling 262.7km race .\nAlberto Contador says he is \"very optimistic\" he will be cleared in doping scandal .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Three sheriff's deputies responded to the scene around 3:45 p.m. Sunday after getting a call about a suspicious person \"from a bystander who had concerns about a person inside the store,\" Deputy Scott Wilson said. The deputies approached one man outside the store's south entrance, but -- rather than responding verbally -- he ran from the scene, turned around to face the deputies and began shooting. \"(The deputies) called to him and said, 'Hey, we need to talk to you,'\" said Wilson. \"He turned around and shot at them, and they returned fire.\" The male shooter was shot and later pronounced dead in the Walmart parking lot. As of Sunday night, authorities had not released his name, age or other details about him. A young female -- thought to be a teenager, said Wilson -- also was shot, with emergency personnel then transporting her to Tacoma General Hospital. She eventually died from her wounds. Wilson said authorities don't know if the female victim knew the male shooting suspect or if she was an innocent bystander. The two deputies, both men with between five and 10 years of experience in the department, were sent to Tacoma General Hospital to be treated for what Wilson described as \"non-life-threatening\" injuries. The third deputy, a woman, wasn't hurt. Wilson described the situation as \"somewhat chaotic\" but \"stabilized.\" \"There is no danger to the community at this point,\" he said. \"We think that all persons (who were) involved ... have been accounted for.\" The Washington State Police were taking over as the lead investigative agency in the case, with the Kitsap County Sheriff's Department also requesting assistance from the FBI. The incident occurred near one of the retail giant's stores in Port Orchard, a town just west of Parkwood. Located on Sinclair Inlet, Port Orchard is about 30 miles north-northwest of Tacoma and across Puget Sound from Seattle. The store was locked down for about 20 minutes immediately after the shooting with about 100 people inside, Walmart customer Mike Lambert told CNN affiliate KIRO, with police tape used to cordon off the parking lot.

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.St. Petersburg, Russia (CNN) -- Russia's President Vladimir Putin on Friday criticized Western nations for failing to ensure that weapons it plans to supply to Syrian rebels do not fall into the hands of al Qaeda. \"Where will those weapons end up,\" Putin told the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, which was moderated by CNN's John Defterios. Putin questioned how weapons could safely be supplied to rebels if the U.S. recognized one of the key opposition groups was al Qaeda's affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra. \"If the United States and the State Department recognize that one of the key opposition organizations al-Nusra is a terrorist organization officially recognized as terrorist which is linked to al Qaeda, how can they give weapons to that part of the opposition?\" he said. \"There are no answers to those questions... so it is not as simple as some people would suggest. We believe that our position is well founded ... we believe only the Syrian people themselves can guarantee a long-term solution.\" His comments came as Syrian rebels said Friday they have received heavy weapons -- including anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles -- from \"brotherly nations that support the Syrian revolution.\" At the G8 summit in Northern Ireland this week, Putin came under intense pressure to back plans to sideline Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Putin is the only G8 leader who supports the Assad regime and during the meetings U.S. President Barack Obama said the two had \"differing perspectives\" but shared an interest in ending the violence. On Friday, Putin laid it out more starkly: \"There is indeed a certain difference of view between us and, let's say, the U.S.,\" he said. The G8 summit came days after the U.S. pledged to play a greater role in assisting Syrian rebels, citing evidence that al-Assad's regime used chemical weapons against the rebels and his own people. But Putin declared that he would not risk arms getting into the hands of rebels who \"who kill their enemies and eat their organs,\" referencing a widely circulated video that purports to show a rebel fighter eating the heart of a dead soldier. Putin reiterated his determination Friday to seek a peaceful outcome. \"We should encourage the sides, the parties to the conflict to engage in dialogue and achieve positive results,\" he said. \"This discussion was among interested parties among partners and there were differing opinions during that debate ... despite the depth and complexity of the problems, we were looking for a way to compromise.\" The Russian leader also laid out plans to boost his country's anemic economic growth and crack down on tax evasion following promises made at the G8 meeting. Putin was speaking alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said she had a \"certain degree of skepticism\" over Turkey's accession to the European Union after the government's heavy-handed approach to protestors. Merkel said she was \"shocked to see how the authorities dealt with demonstrators.\" Turkey has been wracked by more than two weeks of protests against the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Merkel said discussions centred on whether it was the right time for Turkey to join, but that was \"a totally different issue than whether the whole process as such will be stopped.\" Putin said Russia would be tracking corporate accounting but would also look to create new investment opportunities. He added that the country's plans to create \"dynamic economic growth\" which needed a balance between long terms goals and urgent issue. He said the country needed to increase its labor productivity, promote investment and innovation. Putin said the country's tax policy should be working to develop business incentives, modernize business and create high quality jobs. However, he said, \"this is not the end of the course.\" The country would also look closely at \"policy fiscal accounting and book keeping ... we have been talking about that for a long time.\" Putin added: \"Developing our tax policy is not justification for an increase in tax burdens for business.\" Putin will be chair of the G-20 summit in September, following from the G8 summit of major developed nations. At the G8 -- made up of UK, U.S., Germany, Russia, France, Italy, Japan and Canada -- the leaders also agreed to step up efforts to make individuals and companies pay the taxes they owe. Stung by mounting evidence that major companies are shifting profits across borders, G8 leaders said countries should change rules to prevent that from happening and multinationals should report what tax they pay and where. Tackling illegal tax avoidance has become increasingly important for governments as they struggle to revive their economies while paying down debt levels that exploded in the wake of the global financial crisis. Pressure has intensified in the wake of Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's suggestions this week the stimulus program could be scaled back this year and end it completely in 2014. Stock markets around the world sank, including by nearly 4% in Russia.\n### Response : ", "target": "Russian president criticizes West for failing to ensure weapons don't reach al Qaeda .\nPutin under intense pressure to back plans to sideline Syrian President Bashar al-Assad .\n\"There is indeed a certain difference of view between us and the U.S.\" - Putin .\nLatest comments made at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:Can you give me a quick rundown?Atlanta (CNN) -- A search-and-rescue team on Monday found the body of a missing hot air balloonist who had crashed in Georgia three days earlier. Acting on a tip from a witness who saw an object falling Friday, authorities dispatched a helicopter in the direction she described and quickly found the body of Ed Ristaino of North Carolina, according to Ben Hill County Sheriff Bobby McLemore. \"We were relieved that we found him,\" McLemore said. \"But that still leaves recovery.\" Teams made up of state patrol officers, forestry units, neighboring sheriff's department personnel and volunteers scoured areas east of Fitzgerald in south-central Georgia, where the balloon basket went down. At least seven helicopters and planes and more than 100 people on the ground participated in the difficult search, McLemore said. Ristaino had taken five skydivers up in his hot air balloon around 6:45 p.m. Friday when he noticed the wind picking up and realized he was driving the balloon toward a large incoming storm system, McLemore said. \"The storm was pulling the balloon closer towards it, so he asked the skydivers to bail out. He had them jump from about 5,000 feet.\" While the five skydivers landed safely and were picked up, Ristaino and the balloon continued heading southeast and rose another 2,000 feet, McLemore said. \"He went up into the clouds and had radio contact with his ground crew and told them it was hailing on him, there was lightning and rain and heavy wind,\" he said. An updraft carried Ristaino up to about 17,000 or 18,000 feet above ground before a downdraft collapsed the balloon and sent him plummeting. Ristaino stayed calm and talked to his ground crew on the radio the entire time he was falling. \"I'm in trouble. I'm falling. I don't have anything above my head,\" McLemore recalled from accounts told to him. The balloonist said he was falling at 2,000 feet per minute, but an altimeter reading says he may have been falling as quickly as 60 to 90 mph, McLemore said. \"As he was falling, he did a countdown. He couldn't see anything because he was in the clouds. But when he broke through the clouds, he said, 'I see trees,' and that's the last thing they heard.\" A friend of Ristaino's called him an \"accomplished balloon pilot\" who had logged \"many hours of safe balloon operation.\" \"He was very much a gentleman and it doesn't surprise me at all that he managed the situation and had his skydiver passengers get out of the balloon for their own safety,\" said Bob Tettman, a fellow balloon pilot.

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary that explains everything about this article for meCan you provide a brief rundown of the text?\n### Input:(CNN) -- I was recently diagnosed with brain cancer. This was shocking news. Sitting across from a doctor holding a clinical folder with your name on it, and hearing him say the words \"low-grade glioma,\" \"language and comprehension areas of your brain,\" \"surgery\" and \"chemotherapy\" is a very weird experience. My first idea was to seek other opinions. Maybe this hospital is wrong. Maybe there are other places that wouldn't need to do surgery. Maybe there is a laser, a chemical, an ancient tradition, a shaman, a scientist, a nanorobot. I felt incomplete about the way that the medical system was handling my situation. Being \"diseased\" is like a state of suspended life. Can I work? Have fun? Be creative? Not really. When you are declared \"diseased,\" you become a set of medical records, therapy, dosages, exam dates. It's as if you disappear, replaced by your disease. I immediately asked for my clinical records in digital format, and left the hospital. TED.com: A new understanding of cancer . My main objective -- the best thing I felt that I could do -- was to make my digital information available on the Internet, in formats that would allow people of multiple cultures, skills, professions and inclinations to access, use, recombine and redistribute it. Why would I want them to access this information? To help me find the best cure for myself, and in the process to produce substantial social change by redefining the word \"cure.\" But when I went home to publish my medical records, all I could do was send them to specialized professionals, either by duplicating the CDs and mailing them or by copying their closed format and uploading them somewhere. I had no direct access to my own information, since I use Linux and OSX rather than the files' Windows-based viewer. As a software engineer, I found software and programming tools to hack the files and make them open -- but a nontechnical person would have difficulty making use of their own medical data. I needed, first of all, something which I could easily share, maybe allowing people to open it from their browsers, or even from their smartphones. TED.com: New strategy in war on cancer . So I opened up my medical records and converted the data into multiple formats: spreadsheets, databases, metadata files in XML and video, image and sound files. And I published them on The Cure. The responses have been incredible. More than 200,000 people have visited the site and many have provided videos, poems, medical opinions, suggestions of alternative cures or lifestyles, personal stories of success or, sadly, failures -- and simply the statement, \"I am here.\" Among them were more than 90 doctors and researchers who offered information and support. The geneticist and TED fellow Jimmy Lin has offered to sequence the genome of my tumor after surgery -- in an open-source platform, of course. And the Italian parliament has been debating a motion to make all patients' medical records more open and accessible, which would be amazing progress in my country. Within one day I also heard from two different doctors, who recommended similar kinds of surgery. The first version is \"awake surgery,\" which monitors the brain in real time as different parts are touched. The second is a variation in which electrodes are placed on the brain during surgery, and then a brain map is produced (with the patient awake) and used during a second surgery (with the patient fully unconscious). TED.com: Your genes are not your fate . Existing portals and websites that allow patients and ex-patients to exchange stories and opinions already exist. But we're talking about something different. I see a cure as a dynamic process, in which multiple doctors, professionals, artists, scientists and others join as a society -- to converse, support each other, be open to various contributions and shape solutions that merge humanity, technology, technique, philosophy and art. Creativity and \"normal life\" become part of the process and bring \"diseased\" people back to life. To me, a true cure is complete, is human, and has dignity. And it never ends. Such a cure is a dialogue in which \"experts\" maintain their status -- and in fact, an enormous thank you goes out to all the extremely qualified professionals who are constantly responding to my calls -- but the whole process opens up to possibility. TED.com: The potential of regenerative medicine . And this is exactly what is happening: We are creating a cure by uniting the contributions of surgeons, homeopaths, oncologists, Chinese doctors, nutritionists and spiritual healers. The active participation of everyone involved -- both experts and ex-patients -- is naturally filtering out any damaging suggestion which might be proposed. To achieve this kind of cure, we must be open to strategies from different cultures and philosophical orientations. And we must embrace a wider, more profound discourse about the ways in which information circulates digitally. For now, I'm following a complex strategy developed with the help of a series of doctors and experts who responded to my open-source cure site and have suggested a variety of therapies to deal with the disease. As of now, my cancer growth has stopped. We are waiting for the next test results to decide when and if to proceed to surgery. How can you be involved?

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the central ideas presented?\n### Input:Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Fearing for people's safety, Iranian opposition leaders canceled a demonstration planned for the anniversary of last year's disputed presidential election, according to a statement posted on Facebook Thursday. The protests were to have taken place Saturday. Iranians went to the polls a year ago on that day, and when word of fraud surfaced, so did public outrage. Widespread unrest gripped the Islamic republic as protesters clashed with police. But the hard-line government's crackdown on the opposition -- known as the Green Movement and led by former presidential candidates Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi -- has been, at times, brutal. And the government has steadily been tightening its grip throughout the year, said a report issued Thursday by Human Right Watch, which has been monitoring the situation through interviews with people in Iran. The government and police had issued warnings to Iranians not to participate in any gatherings Saturday. A joint statement posted on Moussavi's Facebook page said that it was obvious to the opposition that if \"innocent and defenseless\" people took to the streets Saturday, they would once again be met with violence. Green Movement supporters have always said they seek democratic reforms and civil rights, not violence. \"By considering the report of the representatives of reformist parties and also for the safety of the people, we are announcing that the planned demonstration will not be held,\" the statement said. \"We ask the people and the protesters to demand and follow up on their rightful demands and requests through less costly and more effective methods.\" Iran's anti-government demonstrations started out strong but have limped along in recent months as security forces have sought to silence the voices of dissent. Human Rights Watch said the current atmosphere inside the country is markedly different than the images of defiance that filled the internet and television screens starting a year ago. \"While the international community has focused on Iran's nuclear ambitions, Tehran has been methodically crushing all forms of dissent inside the country,\" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \"Journalists, lawyers, and civil society activists who used to speak to foreign media and human rights groups are increasingly reluctant, fearing phone and internet surveillance,\" he said in a statement released with the latest report. The rights group says that Iran's crackdown extends beyond election protesters. The 19-page report lists abuses including arbitrary arrests, extra-judicial killings, rapes, torture and violations of the rights to freedom of assembly and expression. Scores of journalists and human rights activists have been targeted, the report says, and the government has executed at least seven Kurdish political dissidents, while more than a dozen still sit on death row. Iran has defended its record before the United Nations Human Rights Council. Mohammad Javad Larijani, the secretary general of Iran's High Council for Human Rights, has said that the government only goes after those who incite violence. \"Nobody is jailed because of the protest,\" Larijani told CNN in February. \"The only reason for jailing is the violence which was attached with the protests. Any government has a duty to bring an end to the violence.

{"source": "### Instruction :Write a summary of the given paragraph.\n### Input:(CNN) -- It was one of the worst genocides since the Nazi era. The brutal Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia in 1975 and terrorized the population for four years, killing more than one million people. One of its infamous leaders died Thursday, escaping judgment for war crimes at the hands of a U.N. tribunal. Ieng Sary passed away in the capital Phnom Penh at age 87, the United Nations-backed court for Cambodia said. He was the foreign minister under, and the brother-in-law-of, Khmer Rouge dictator Pol Pot. On Tuesday, he was hospitalized for stomach pains. The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia -- the U.N.-backed court -- will establish the cause of death before releasing his body to his family. Ieng Sary's death leaves just two defendants facing judgment by the tribunal. His wife, Ieng Thirith, was excluded from the case after she was deemed unfit to stand trial in September 2012. But charges of torture and murder will continue against the remaining defendants -- former nominal head of state Khieu Samphan and former prime minister Nuon Chea. Proceedings halted . Following Ieng Sary's death, Amnesty International asked the court to continue with its proceedings without delay. \"The news of Ieng Sary's death will be difficult for the victims of the Khmer Rouge crimes who have waited so long for justice,\" said Rupert Abbott of the human rights group. The court has faced criticism that it has proceeded too slowly with the trial. The defendants are more than 77 years old, and more of them could die before facing judgment. On Tuesday, proceedings came to a grinding halt after local staffers walked out, saying they will not return until they are paid wages owed by the cash-strapped court for the last three months. A bloody period . Pol Pot came to power as a communist revolutionary after toppling the U.S. backed government in Phnom Penh, when American troops left the region in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam war. For the next four years, the communist Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot was blamed for the deaths of some 1.7 million people through torture, execution, hard labor and starvation. Pol Pot's rule became known as the era of the killing fields when cities were emptied and residents slaughtered. A Vietnamese invasion in 1979 forced the Khmer Rouge to retreat back to the jungle. The dictator died in 1998 before the tribunal's existence and never faced trial. Double jeopardy? The Vietnamese who invaded Cambodia quickly put Ieng Sary on trial and convicted him in absentia in 1979. When he defected from what remained of the broken Khmer Rouge regime in 1996, the Cambodian king pardoned him. The defense for Ieng Sary once argued that the case against him should be dismissed on grounds of double jeopardy -- a defendant cannot be tried twice for the same crime. The court considered the motion.

{"source": "### Instruction:Could you highlight the primary messages?In recent years, social games have become increasingly prevalent on mobile devices, providing entertainment, yes, but also a way to maintain contact with family and friends. But for Debbie Fisher, who's legally blind, the visual displays used to play and chat meant they were off limits to her. Fisher, 37, is a mother of four from Reno, Nevada, who has a genetic disorder called retinitis pigmentosa. She can only see light and dark shapes and cannot discern details. Fisher said she has always enjoyed playing games with her family. However, she usually needed other people around in order to be able to play. After she got an iPhone and iPad, she tried playing some of the downloadable games, but due to her visual impairment, she couldn't find a game that she enjoyed and that allowed her to play with her friends. Fisher uses the Voice Over accessibility program on her mobile devices to help her \"see\" what's on the screen and interact with it. Still, she said it was tough to find games that were compatible with the program. \"I always get the free version (of games) to make sure it is Voice Over compatible, which is what makes the iPhone and the iPad talk,\" she said. \"If it works, then I'll get the paid version, but I need to make sure it works first.\" That's opened up some options. But only one game, she says, has let her both play and communicate with friends. \"Hanging With Friends\" (Zynga) is a word game that resembles Hangman, but with a few twists. One player comes up with a word that another player tries to guess one letter at a time. Get a letter wrong and the balloons holding up your avatar will start popping until there is nothing to save you from the lava pit below. The game, which debuted in July, is played one-on-one with anyone anywhere. Fisher said \"Hanging With Friends\" specifically works with Voice Over and lets her \"see\" what's going on and chat with her family and friends who are playing. \"Playing a game against the computer is one thing. But playing against real people is what makes it so much better,\" she said. Paul Bettner, general manager of Zynga With Friends, said they didn't intend to make a game for the visually impaired, but are pleased that their game can be enjoyed by people like Fisher. \"It may seem silly to think that a game can change someone's world, but why not?\" Bettner said. \" 'Hanging With Friends' was designed so that nearly anyone can pick it up and play and we are very happy and proud to welcome visually impaired players now as well.\" Fisher said there are other games that are Voice Over compatible, but they don't allow for the social interaction that \"Hanging With Friends\" does. She said she hopes more social games will embrace the Voice Over program so she can enjoy them with her family and friends. \" 'Hanging With Friends' really wasn't my type of game until I started playing it,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have even guessed that I'd be so into that game before I started playing it.

Three tornadoes stuck Minnesota. One hit near rural St. James. Kholby Martin, a storm chaser with KDR Media, said it was a couple of hundred yards wide but it wasn't fully condensed. Officials said no one was hurt, nor was there any structural damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Colorado. There was still a possibility of tornadoes in south central Minnesota and central Iowa on Thursday night. Dallas County in Texas saw an hourlong tornado warning Thursday afternoon as the system moved through, bringing winds of up to 70 mph, the National Weather Service said. Students at Southern Methodist University were told to shelter in place. That was followed by a flash flood warning for several counties in the area through the early evening hours. CNN affiliate WFAA reported that five boys were rescued from a creek after fast-moving waters moved in. Emergency responders found the boys clinging to whatever they could find along the shore, the station said. There was wind damage around the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. In one neighborhood in west Dallas, residents told WFAA that when the storm hit they saw debris flying through the air and heard transformers popping. Deborah Drake came home to find the glass in an entrance door to her home shattered by some of that debris. \"You just heard this noise (like a train whistle) then it just shook the house,\" said a neighbor who was helping her clean up broken glass. \"I ran in the bathroom and got in the bathtub.\" Some areas of South Dakota near Harrisburg were pelted by quarter-size hail, according to the National Weather Service in Sioux Falls. Winds were blowing as fast as 50 mph. On Friday, strong storms will probably strike from Arkansas to Indiana, with rain in the Midwest, South and Northeast as the system moves east. That blustery, wet weather could affect as many as 14 million people, CNN meteorologist Sherri Pugh said. Saturday should bring more rain for those areas, too. Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida, will also get wet as 1 to 3 inches of rain is forecast. The area has been dealing with recent heavy rains, so the risk is high in those areas for flash flooding, and there's been a flash flood watch issued. Tired of reading about rain?

Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling establishing a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. Anti-abortion activists held a rally on the National Mall and marched to the Supreme Court, followed by a walk to Capitol Hill to urge legislative action. An annual March for Life has been held in Washington since 1974. \"We want to change people's hearts and minds and help them to know that abortion ... is not necessary and really undermines the rights of women,\" U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops spokeswoman Deirdre McQuade told CNN. \"We're working toward the day when abortion will not only be illegal but unthinkable.\" Abortion rights supporters, led in part by the National Organization for Women, planned their own rally and vigil on the steps of the high court. \"A fetus is not a life, sorry,\" NOW President Terry O'Neill told CNN. \"And no, nobody's religious conviction justifies taking women's ability to shape their own futures away from them.\" Activists on both sides of the highly divisive issue believe there is a chance the conservative-leaning high court could eventually overturn the 1973 ruling. Questions regarding abortion rights have played a key role in the health care reform debate. A number of abortion rights supporters believe a bill passed by the House of Representatives in November does not do enough to provide access to reproductive services. Many abortion rights opponents say legislation approved by the Senate in December does not go far enough to ensure taxpayer dollars are not used to fund abortions.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you distill the main concepts?\n### Input:Editor's note: Join Roland S. Martin for his weekly sound-off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. ET Wednesday. If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. A nationally syndicated columnist, Martin has said he will vote for Barack Obama in November. He is the author of \"Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith\" and \"Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America.\" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland S. Martin says the McCain campaign has done Sarah Palin a disservice by keeping her hidden. (CNN) -- Is Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin running for vice president of the United States or vice president of the student council? Listening to some political strategists, pundits and radio and TV blowhards, you would think that all she has to do is show up, sign her name on the roll, and she's done enough to satisfy the requirement for president. Do people really and truly understand that she will be sitting a heartbeat away from the presidency, backing up a 72-year-old guy who has a history of cancer? Nothing drives me nuts more than listening to some of these folks who act as if we shouldn't expect Palin -- and Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Joe Biden -- to be well-versed on national issues, foreign policy and the social and cultural issues that have to define America. Conventional wisdom says that the vice president means nothing and that the voters going to the polls between now and November 4 are really voting on Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain. iReport.com: What would you ask Palin, Biden? But looking at the role that the last few vice presidents have played, especially Vice President Dick Cheney, it is clear that the VP can make a world of difference and that we should be demanding the tough answers to tough questions from both candidates. Now, the blowhards have been going on and on, suggesting that too much attention is being paid to her gaffes and not to those of Biden. True. But what we have learned this election season is that there are double standards. Countless folks have said that we all know McCain, and it's necessary to scrutinize every aspect of Obama. Really? I think if you ask the average person, they'll know a lot more about Obama's childhood than McCain, solely by the level of scrutiny. The truth is, the nation doesn't know much about Palin. And when folks don't know a lot about you, there is an expectation to get to know more. As for Palin, I fundamentally believe that millions of Americans want to know what she thinks about the critical issues of the day and not from reading cue cards. The McCain camp has done her a huge disservice by treating her like a Faberge egg, totally untouchable. She needed to do multiple media interviews and not keep an arm's distance from the media and, yes, the general public. Back to that low expectation thing. The reality is that the McCain camp and Republicans want that. Even Biden and the Obama camp are tamping down expectations, hoping that if the bar is set just above someone's ankle, it will be easy to cross. Hogwash. Now is not the time for low bars and low expectations. We need our candidates to think big and be big. They need to speak to our concerns and our fears. And yes, Biden has been around a long time, and many say they know what to expect from the loquacious one. But Palin must strut her stuff. Thursday's debate will not be read from a teleprompter. It won't be on cue cards. With the nation watching, she is going to put up or shut up. What is most at stake is whether she's the subject of further ridicule or can show Americans that she has a strong command of the issues. If she can do the latter, she validates McCain's selection. If not, she calls into question his judgment, and at this stage of the game, that is not a good thing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.\n### Response :", "target": "Vice presidential candidate can make world of difference, Roland Martin says .\nMcCain campaign has done Palin a disservice, he writes .\nMartin says American people want to know where she stands .\nThursday's debate will be proving ground, Martin writes .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
{"source": "### Instruction:What's the main idea?Beijing, China (CNN) -- There is a long and growing laundry list in recent months of China butting heads with the rest of the world and, analysts say, the rest of the world had better get used to it. Beijing barely flinched when Google threatened to leave China, claiming to have been the victim of cyber attacks. Additionally, the government here doesn't seem troubled by being the lone holdout blocking U.N. sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program -- China has the political muscle that comes with a booming economy and a political leadership which appears to be very self-assured. \"Well, China is certainly very self-confident,\" said Jonathan Fenby with Trusted Sources, a research group which specializes in BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) economies. \"China suffered from the world downturn... but it's pulled itself out of that... and the Chinese are feeling pretty good and pretty sure of themselves,\" Fenby said. \"It's a bit like, say, Britain at the height of the Victorian era or perhaps the United States after the Second World War ... they feel they're on a roll. Many analysts seem to point to the November visit here by U.S. President Barack Obama as some sort of turning point: despite two days of meetings with the highest levels of the Chinese government, Obama walked away with very little. One of the big issues for the U.S. is China's currency -- considered undervalued by 20 to 40 percent, giving Chinese exporters a competitive edge. The currency issue has also been raised by the Europeans and the International Monetary Fund -- and the Chinese government has stared them all down, declaring the currency a sovereign issue. \"In the past, China could say, for instance of its exchange rate: that is a sovereign issue, that's something only we can decide, it only affects us. But today that's much more difficult of an argument to make, because China's decisions affect the rest of the world and everyone else in the world has an opinion about what China should be doing,\" said Patrick Chovanec from Tsinghua University. Obama's visit to China was followed by December's U.N. Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen, seen by many as a disappointment. China came under criticism for the summit's failures, especially from Britain. It was the British again who were involved in a very open diplomatic spat with the Chinese a few days later, when Beijing executed British citizen Akmal Shaikh; his family claimed he was bipolar and tricked into being a drug mule, while the Chinese said he was smuggler and executed after being caught with about four kilograms of heroin, despite a direct appeal from the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. \"I don't think that China's relations with the rest of the world suddenly turned ugly,\" Chovanec said. \"Any time you have a rise of a new power, this is going to upset the existing balance of things, there is going to be a big adjustment.\" Get ready for a few difficult months ahead when the U.S. delivers the latest Patriot missiles to Taiwan, and the Dalai Lama makes his first official visit to the Obama White House. And from an economic point of view, sometime this year, China may overtake Japan to be the world's second biggest economy and looks set to continue to boom. \"I think there is a real difficulty here for the West,\" said Jonathan Fenby. \"One feels the United States hasn't really worked out what its China policy is.\"\n### Response : ", "target": "Analysts say China is increasingly influential in global affairs .\nChina stands alone in blocking U.N. sanctions against Iran .\nChina may overtake Japan to be the world's second biggest economy .\nOne of the big issues for the U.S. is China's undervalued currency .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Mattel Inc. spent millions opening a six-story flagship store in Shanghai to great fanfare to bring the doll franchise to China in 2009. Two years later, it closed its doors. \"Barbie spent a lot of money setting up a boutique in the most fashionable part of Shanghai, where you could go and have all of your Barbie needs met. You could have a fashion consultation, you could of course buy lots of Barbie dolls,\" said Karl Gerth, author of \"As China Goes, So Goes the World: How Chinese Consumers Are Transforming Everything.\" However, \"they didn't think long and hard enough about whether Chinese girls wanted to look sexy or they wanted to look something closer to what you'd associate with Japan -- cute,\" Gerth added. \"So Hello Kitty is doing well, but Barbie is an example of crash and burn.\" It's a lesson in localization rather than grafting tried-and-true Western business plans to the Chinese market, \"On China\" experts told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout. As China's ranks of consumers swell -- the number of middle class earners is estimated to grow 70% to 600 million by 2020 -- so too rises the stakes for companies looking to cash into China's growing consumer market. \"It's very important for the Western brands to not simply take an existing strategy or operations and try to take it into Chinese market,\" said Janet Wang, director of international business development for Tmall.com. \"You always have to be very flexible, be reactive to consumers' requirements and demands.\" One company that's done it right, Wang said, is Starbucks. \"They really localize their products to fit Chinese consumers' taste -- and not only the coffee itself ... they have pastry dedicated to Chinese flavors, (such as) dedicated products for the Moon Festival,\" said Wang, referring to traditional cuisine during China's Mid-Autumn Festival. \"They are trying to adapt their coffee into a traditional Chinese tea house. And it really blends the West meets East culture.\" One area where Western brands have some headway against their domestic Chinese competitors is product safety, in the wake of scandals over tainted baby formula, fake eggs and exploding watermelons. Shaun Rein said his company, China Market Research Group, interviewed 5,000 Chinese consumers in 15 cities last year. \"Their biggest concern in life, ahead of being able to pay education for their kids, or for medical care cost for their families, was food and product safety,\" Rein said. \"They're absolutely petrified of biting something and dying, or getting toxic shock syndrome from a toy. So what we've found is in these 5,000 consumers they trust foreign brands far more than they trust local domestic Chinese brands,\" Rein said. A dichotomy is growing in Chinese consumer trends between shopping for status and shopping for value. \"What that means is, people don't buy mid-level brands, which is why you see (brands?) like Marks & Spencer, or Li-Ning, or Gap kind of struggle, because these are branded for middle-class consumers,\" Rein said. \"What we see is people either shop for the most expensive things they can get, like a Louis Vuitton or Hermes bag, or they go for the cheapest.\" Still, there is a growing individualism in consumer tastes -- and a widening gap for new players to enter the market, the experts said. \"So for brand managers, now is the best time to come to China,\" Rein advised. \"Because people are no longer being monopolized by the same five brands. You know, you don't have to have a Omega (watch) any more -- now maybe you can buy something from Richemont.\" CNN's Kristie Lu Stout contributed to this report .\n### Response :", "target": "As China's ranks of consumers swell so too rises the stakes for companies looking to cash in .\nAnalysts: Toymaker Mattel failed to cater to Chinese tastes for cute over sexy .\nCompanies often try to graft successful overseas strategies onto the Chinese market .\nStarbucks has succeeded in catering to Chinese tastes to grow its business .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

Engelbart died Tuesday night at his home in Atherton, California, SRI International -- the research institute where he once worked -- said in a statement. He was 88. \"Doug's legacy is immense \u2014 anyone in the world who uses a mouse or enjoys the productive benefits of a personal computer is indebted to him,\" Curtis R. Carlson, SRI's president and CEO, said in a written statement. Decades ago, Engelbart came up with the idea we now know as a mouse. His first prototype, which featured a carved out wooden block, wheels and a tiny red button, looks quite different from the sleek plastic designs now seen in homes and offices around the world. A radar technician during World War II, Engelbart worked at the Stanford Research Institute during the 1960s. It was there that a vision of people sitting in front of a video screen, interacting with a computer, came to him. \"I knew enough engineering and had enough experience as a radar person to know that if a computer can punch cards or print paper, it can draw anything you want on a screen,\" he told CNN in 1997 after receiving a $500,000 prize for American innovation. Engelbart invented and patented what he called the \"x-y position indicator,\" receiving a $10,000 check for the invention. He told CNN he couldn't recall who on his team had decided to call it a mouse. At the time, it wasn't easy to convince fellow scientists to follow his vision, Engelbart said. But he persisted. Later, he went on to found the Doug Engelbart Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to boosting the collective ability to solve complex, urgent problems on a global scale. \"Sometimes I reflect on how naive somebody has to be in order to get visions -- and plug away at them -- that ultimately proceed, and how many other people with visions that are as naive just fall off the cliff,\" Engelbart told CNN in 1997. In addition to the computer mouse, Engelbart's work at SRI from 1957 to 1977 helped develop tech innovations such as display editing, online processing, linking and in-file object addressing, use of multiple windows, hypermedia, and context-sensitive help, the institute said. \"Doug was a giant who made the world a much better place and who deeply touched those of us who knew him,\" Carlson said. \"SRI was very privileged and honored to have him as one of our 'family.'

Nottingham magistrates court heard how the 31-year-old told police officers he had been to buy a screwdriver so he could release his cat who was trapped under the floorboards of his home. The trial was adjourned until October, but after the England team arrived in London to begin training ahead of the third Test with Pakistan, two of Swann's teammates joked about the affair on their Twitter accounts.

Captain Andrew Strauss was Riaz's first victim as he was caught behind by Kamran Akmal for just 15, before the pace bowler went on to claim the scalps of Jonathan Trott, Pietersen, Eoin Morgan and Stuart Broad. Wicketkeeper Matt Prior gave England's total some respectability with a forceful 84 not out and he was ably assisted by Broad, who made 48. Saeed Ajmal trapped England's last batsman, Steve Finn, LBW as Pakistan dismissed the hosts with more than an hour's play remaining.

Comanche had been closing the gap in the 628-nautical mile race but ultimately was 49 minutes slower than Wild Oats XI, which is owned by wine magnate Robert Oatley. \"To rewrite a bit of sailing history doesn't come along every day,\" Wild Oats XI's skipper, Mark Richards, was quoted as saying by the race's official website. \"To win a Hobart is a great honor but to win an eighth, I can't believe I am here. \"Comanche was unbelievably impressive down Sydney Harbour and the whole first night she had the legs on us. We thought, 'How are we going to handle this thing?' \"It was definitely our toughest race -- to have a boat so close for so much of the race, especially when she's faster than you. I said to the guys 'We've got to hang in there, hang tough, minimize our losses and wait for the first opportunity we get to attack.'\" That opportunity came in the Bass Strait. The lighter conditions suited Wild Oats XI, which opened up a big lead. \"We were about a quarter of the way into Bass Strait and expecting a westerly breeze, and all of a sudden Stan (navigator Stan Honey) came up from down below and said, 'I just got a new weather file, this is not looking good,'\" Comanche skipper Ken Read was quoted as saying by the race's official website. \"We were two miles ahead of them, in bumpy seas, and they literally went by us, probably going a knot or two faster at the time, and they just sailed into more pressure and just kept extending on the whole fleet. \"Both boats sailed a flawless race but they had their day. They had 12 hours where they had Wild Oats' weather, but that's racing.\" While it wasn't known whether Comanche would return next year, Oatley said Wild Oats XI would be back. \"We will be back next year, yes, we'll definitely be back next year,\" Oatley was quoted as saying by the race's website. \"She is the best boat in the world. She's proved that.\"\n### Response :", "target": "Wild Oats XI achieves a record eighth line honor in the annual Rolex Sydney-Hobart boat race .\nWild Oats XI finishes in two days, two hours, three minutes and 26 seconds .\nComanche placed second after entering the race with much fanfare and making a fast start .\nComanche is owned by Netscape co-founder Jim Clark and his model wife .", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}

{"source": "### Instruction:Write a summary of the given paragraph.Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- Disgraced football legend O.J. Simpson was in a Las Vegas courtroom Monday in a bid to get his robbery, assault and kidnapping convictions thrown out. Dressed in a blue prison uniform, the Heisman Trophy winner and former Buffalo Bills star halfback appeared to have grayed some during his four years of incarceration. He listened intently through hours of testimony, which concluded Monday evening. Simpson, who is serving a 33-year prison term, is asking for a new trial. In court papers, he's arguing that bad legal advice led to his arrest and conviction in a 2007 confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers. Simpson accuses his old lawyer, Yale Galanter, of having a conflict of interest and of failing to mount an effective defense in his trial. He also says Galanter told him before that confrontation that he was within his rights to take back property he believed had been stolen from him, \"so long as there would be no trespass and no physical force used against the persons with the property.\" Among the witness called on Monday was Arnelle Simpson, one of O.J. Simpson's daughters, who said she and her father had dinner with Galanter and his wife the night before the incident took place. Simpson, 65, was convicted of leading a group of associates into a room at the Palace Station hotel and casino and using threats, guns and force to take back the items from the two dealers. \"Simpson also contends that Galanter did not advise Simpson that carrying out the plan could subject him to criminal charges, regardless of the ownership of the property,\" his new lawyers wrote in seeking a new trial. Simpson also blames Galanter for preventing him from testifying in his own defense. Without putting him on the stand, \"There was no evidence presented to adequately challenge the state's evidence of criminal intent and knowledge of the guns or the bad character evidence to which the jury was exposed,\" his appeal states. The Nevada Supreme Court already upheld his conviction in 2010. Prosecutors have called the new attempt to reverse his conviction \"without merit,\" and Galanter is quoted in court papers as telling the judge in the original trial that he spoke to Simpson only after the confrontation. \"Other than Simpson's bare allegations, the record does not support any conflict of interest,\" prosecutors wrote in response to Simpson's claims. Galanter could not be immediately reached for comment Sunday. Simpson's October 2008 conviction came on the anniversary of his famous acquittal on murder charges in the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. Though cleared of criminal charges, a civil jury later slapped him with a $33 million wrongful-death judgment, and lawyers for the Goldman family have doggedly pursued his assets. His current sentence leaves him eligible for parole in 2017.

Relatives of passengers on the doomed jet arrive at Marseille airport in southern France. The ministry clarified comments made earlier in the day by the ministry's junior minister for cooperation Alain Joyandet. He told CNN affiliate BFM TV that the \"black boxes\" -- the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder -- had been localized. \"The jet distress beacons were found, instead of the black boxes,\" the ministry later clarified. \"There could have been some confusion.\" The Airbus 310 went down early Tuesday, carrying 142 passengers and 11 crew members on a flight that originated in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. The jet took off from Sanaa at 9:45 p.m. Monday and vanished from radar when it was about 16 miles from Comoros' capital, Moroni. The French navy and Yemeni authorities expanded search efforts for wreckage and bodies Wednesday, with a French frigate among the ships joining the search.   Watch what is known about the flight \u00bb . Searchers had recovered three bodies, Qadir said. Bahia Bakari, a 13-year-old French girl, was the only known survivor. Her mother was also on the flight, but she has not been found. The girl's father Kassim Bakari told France Info, a French radio network, that his wife and daughter were flying to Comoros to visit relatives.  Watch as airline describes child's rescue \u00bb . \"When I had her on the phone, I asked her what happened and she said, 'Daddy, I don't know what happened, but the plane fell into the water and I found myself in the water ... surrounded by darkness. I could not see anyone,'\" Bakari said. Passengers on the flight included 66 French citizens, 54 Comorians, one Palestinian and one Canadian, according to Yemeni and French officials. The crew was made up of six Yemenis, two Moroccans, one Ethiopian, one Filipino and one Indonesian. A number of potential contributing factors were being considered in the crash.  Recent plane crashes \u00bb . \"The weather conditions were indeed very troubling and the winds were very strong, reaching 61 kilometers per hour (38 mph),\" Qadir said. \"That's one thing. The other thing was that the sea was very rough when the plane approached landing at Moroni airport.\" But French Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau noted that France banned the Yemenia Airbus A310-300 several years ago because of safety concerns. \"People are talking about poor weather conditions, but for the moment, we are unsure,\" Bussereau said. \"It seems the plane may have attempted an approach, put on the gas, and attempted another approach, which then failed. For the moment, we must be careful, because none of this information is verified.\" Qadir said it was too early to blame the aircraft for the crash. \"This plane is just like any other plane,\" he said. \"It can have a malfunction, but we don't know what really happened before the investigation is over. And then we can determine if there is a technical issue, bad weather or anything else that may have led to the crash.\" It is the second crash involving an Airbus jet in a month. On June 1, an Air France Airbus A330 crashed off Brazil while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. All 228 aboard are presumed dead. The cause remains under investigation.

{"source": "### Instruction: How would you distill the main concepts?\n### Input:(CNN) -- General Motors CEO Mary Barra headed to Congress Tuesday to give testimony about GM's alleged mishandling of defective ignition switches in its cars. It's an awkward moment. After all, the automaker is having to explain its questionable behavior to the same benefactor -- the U.S. government -- that financially supported the company when it needed the protection of bankruptcy laws in 2009. Despite tougher laws enacted in 2000 and 2010 to encourage automakers and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to aggressively root out safety concerns, it is believed that it took GM more than 10 years to publicly acknowledge that it had a potentially fatal problem. Barra testified, among other things, about GM's recall of 1.6 million vehicles because of faulty ignition switches that may have led to deaths of 13 people. Facing impending litigation, it is proffering an interesting defense, essentially saying: . \"That was the Old GM. We are the New GM. Therefore, we're not responsible. Thanks for buying American.\" As you can imagine, whether in the courtroom, the workplace or home, a defense like this would not get you too far. It's not likely it would even fly in kindergarten. Whether it's gun charges or throwing Play-Doh at others, avoiding responsibility because the bad behavior occurred at a point in time prior to the present has never been a viable excuse. Yet, for some of the largest corporations, this defense not only thrives, it's government-approved. Like the mythical phoenix, GM's bankruptcy filing in 2009 -- and the subsequent restructuring agreement -- allowed the company to rise again from its ashes. After GM filed for bankruptcy, the U.S. government rescued it with a restructuring agreement that, in part, protected the company from legal claims arising prior to bankruptcy. In fairness, the idea of avoiding past liability is not a novel concept in the esoteric world of bankruptcy. In fact, the public policy behind it makes sense. Bankruptcy is a process where people and businesses can eliminate or repay some or all of their debts, under the watchful eye of an intervening federal bankruptcy court. To help them \"start over,\" companies or persons may obtain a discharge, or forgiveness, of debt in the process. The debtor is released from liability for the debt. Sorry creditors. Under the approved asset sale agreement in GM's bankruptcy, what was called \"New GM\" agreed to assume liability for products liability claims arising from accidents involving GM vehicles, but only where the accident occurred after July 10, 2009, regardless of when the product was purchased. \"Old GM\" retained liability for other products liability claims, and \"New GM\" assumed no liability for injuries prior to July 10, 2009. New GM kept the productive assets, with none of the irritating encumbrances of Old GM. Plaintiffs with pending claims prior to the magic date, and any injuries that arose prior to July 10, 2009, are stuck going after Old GM in the bankruptcy court proceeding. The same Old GM that went bankrupt. Good luck. Because of the 2009 cutoff, the lawyers will have to use creative tactics to hold New GM liable. For example, if New GM continued with an ongoing fraud after 2009 to conceal defects, or if it knowingly deceived the bankruptcy judge about its wrongdoing, that could potentially neutralize GM's supposed immunity. If this is troubling, blame the bankruptcy court and the others who agreed to this cutoff. You can blame New GM, too, but it was just acting as any company does, whether new or old: It exists to maximize profit. Any company's management is legally obligated to do just that. Bankruptcy recognizes that there will be losers in the process, and those losers are creditors of the company. After all, if a bankrupt company could continue to be hammered by creditors ad infinitum, it would never climb out of debt. Bankruptcy gives many people and businesses a chance to survive, where they would otherwise be ground into dust by creditors, leaving everyone on the losing end. But even though we may justify the economics, the defense itself is anathema to virtually every lesson our society teaches about responsibility and punishment. Imagine if you could declare criminal \"bankruptcy,\" and refuse to be incarcerated for any crime occurring before the most recent Groundhog Day. Consider your response if your teenager came home and announced he was declining responsibility for any broken windows or bad grades prior to Tuesday. As a cultural consideration, this abdication of responsibility just feels a little strange when applied to, well, virtually every other aspect of life. Nonetheless, readers are encouraged to try the new defense out the next time the boss calls you into the office for a bad review or you get locked up for drug possession, whichever occurs first. Try this excuse out, and report back.

{"source": "### Instruction:How would you briefly describe the text?(CNN) -- Former Miami Dolphins player Chad Johnson is to be arraigned Thursday on a misdemeanor domestic battery charge, prosecutors in Florida said Wednesday. Johnson is charged with first-degree misdemeanor domestic battery in the alleged head-butting last month of his new wife. The charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail, according to the Broward State Attorney's Office. A day after the alleged incident August 11 at his home in Davie, Florida, where he lived with his wife, Evelyn Lozada, the Miami Dolphins released the longtime NFL wide receiver. He played a preseason game the day before the incident, but had not participated in a regular season game with the team. No reason was given for his release. Johnson and Lozada, a cast member on the VH1 reality TV show \"Basketball Wives,\" married on July 4. Their time together was to be featured in a new series on that network. Lozada files for divorce . That reality show, \"Ev and Ocho,\" was canceled shortly after the alleged head-butting, VH1 said on its website. According to the arrest report that the Davie Police Department released last month, Lozada returned to the couple's home from grocery shopping shortly after 7 p.m. August 11 and noticed a receipt with a charge for a box of condoms. The couple then began talking about the sales receipt and their marriage, according to the arrest report. \"As they were talking, Johnson became upset and without (his wife's) permission, grabbed her and butted her on the forehead, causing a laceration,\" the police report said, giving her account. After trying to calm down a screaming Johnson, his wife said she ran \"to a neighbor's house to get away from\" him. A Davie police officer soon responded and found Johnson's wife with an approximately 3-inch cut in the middle of her forehead. Officer Christopher Epps then questioned the football player, the arrest report said. Johnson confirmed there had been an argument, saying his wife had been yelling and that \"she then head-butted Johnson.\" Johnson did not have \"visible marks or bruises,\" the arrest report said. His wife indicated she wanted to press charges, signing an affidavit of complaint, according to police. She was taken to Westside Regional Medical Center in Plantation, Florida, to be treated. The football player was known as Chad Ochocinco -- a Spanish-language take on his jersey number, 85 -- before his marriage. The prolific tweeter, with four posts on August 11 alone, though none about the incident, is known as much for his vibrant personality as his play on the field. He starred in VH1's \"The Ultimate Catch,\" a 2010 reality dating show in which he considered potential female mates in a tournament-style format. Johnson spent his first 10 seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals, earning six Pro Bowl selections.

On the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jim Yong Kim told CNN's Richard Quest that the situation was a \"humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions, and right now we are not responding effectively.\" \"In Lebanon now a quarter of the population are refugees,\" said Kim. \"It would be as if twice the population of Canada came into the United States in a two year period... (Lebanon is) going to lose $7.5 billion in terms of GDP growth. The number of unemployed people in Lebanon -- Lebanese -- has doubled.\" The UNHCR says more than 2 million Syrians have fled their homeland since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, with most taking refuge in the neighboring countries of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. Reports have found many refugee children living without a father, and some without parents altogether. Kim said the response to the crisis had failed due to a lack of funds, but also due to a lack of leadership and concerted effort. \"There are many political difficulties in deciding who's going to step up, who's going to provide the funds. We have given all the money we can under the rules of the World Bank and we now need others to step up,\" Kim said. His organization was \"happy to lead\" the effort, he said. Kim also reiterated the need to address inequality, a hot topic at the World Economic Forum. \"Two and a half billion people in the world don't have access to financial services. This is a bank account. Not having the ability to save is a huge problem,\" he said. \"Eighty percent of people in Africa don't have access to energy.  You cannot participate in the global market if you don't have access to reliable energy.\" There were encouraging signs that some in attendance grasped the long-term economic benefits of investing in health and education. \"People are now understanding that education is going to determine the competitive abilities of a country into the future, but still many finance ministers are looking at the short term.

{"source": "### Instruction:What are the highlights?\n### Input :(CNN) -- How do you say \"scoop\" in Latin? It's a good bet that Giovanna Chirri -- the journalist who broke the story of the pope's resignation -- can tell you. Chirri's knowledge of Latin gave her the edge to understand the magnitude of the pope's announcement. A reporter for ANSA, Italy's state-run news agency, Chirri was among a few reporters at what appeared to be a routine papal announcement Monday. Most media outlets chose not to cover the event, which began with 20 minutes of announcements concerning other church matters, ANSA reported. But then, in Latin, Pope Benedict XVI said he would resign at the end of the month \"because of advanced age.\" The news would surprise the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, but someone had to inform them first. Chirri has \"polished\" Latin skills, her employer said, but it took confidence to trust that she heard what she thought she heard. The pope's resignation, explained . \"(The news of) his resignation didn't seem real to me,\" she told ANSA. \"I told myself 'you misunderstood.'\" The pope's Latin is \"very easy to understand,\" Chirri said, but it wasn't until the announcement was repeated that the reporter filed an urgent bulletin for ANSA, which was subsequently picked up by the rest of the world. A devout Catholic, Chirri told ANSA she tries to keep her faith separate from her work covering the Vatican, but Monday's announcement made her cry because she was upset. \"I fought to keep my nerve despite my knees feeling weak,\" she told the news agency. While Catholic services today are celebrated in local languages, Latin remains the official language of the Roman Catholic church. For this reason, all official acts of the church are announced in Latin, as was the case Monday.\n### Response:", "target": "Italian news agency reporter Giovanna Chirri broke the pope resignation story .\nHer knowledge of Latin gave her the edge to get the scoop .\nThe news had her \"knees feeling weak\"", "origin": "cnndm.csv"}
