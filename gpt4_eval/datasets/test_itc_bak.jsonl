The reason (R) states that 'It interferes with communication'. This is also a correct statement. One of the major effects of noise pollution is that it can interfere with communication. Excessive noise can mask auditory information making it difficult to understand and process.  Therefore, both the assertion (A) and the reason (R) are true. Moreover, the reason (R) is indeed the correct explanation of the assertion (A) because it provides a valid reason why noise pollution is considered unwanted: it interferes with communication.  Hence, the correct option is (a) Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.\nTherefore answer is (a)", "origin": "rs_aggarwal_book_exercise_18D"}

Here's why:Step 1: Understanding the Assertion (A): 'Carbon monoxide when inhaled causes death.' This is a well-known fact. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a poisonous, colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. Despite its name, CO does not have an odor and is not visible. When inhaled, it can interfere with the blood's ability to carry oxygen, leading to hypoxia or lack of oxygen which can cause death.Step 2: Understanding the Reason (R): 'Carbon monoxide combines with hemoglobin.' This statement is also true. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. But when you breathe in carbon monoxide, it binds to hemoglobin, forming carboxyhemoglobin, and prevents the hemoglobin from carrying oxygen.Step 3: Linking Assertion and Reason: The reason carbon monoxide inhalation leads to death is because it combines with hemoglobin and prevents it from carrying oxygen. This lack of oxygen leads to hypoxia and can eventually cause death. Therefore, the reason is the correct explanation of the assertion.Hence, the answer is (a): Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A.\nTherefore answer is (a): Carbon monoxide, when inhaled, combines with hemoglobin of blood to form carboxyhemoglobin which inhibits the transport of oxygen.", "origin": "rs_aggarwal_book_exercise_18A"}

The assertion states that we feel colder on mountains than on plains. This is generally true because the temperature tends to be lower at higher altitudes. The reason given is that temperature decreases with altitude. This is a well-known scientific fact. The temperature of the atmosphere decreases with height due to the thinning of the atmosphere the higher we go. This results in less heat being absorbed from the sun's rays. Therefore, the assertion and the reason are both true. Moreover, the reason is indeed the correct explanation for the assertion. The decrease in temperature with altitude is the reason why we feel colder on mountains than on plains.

We know the position of Amrita and Mukul in the queue and we also know that Mamta is exactly in between them. We need to find the position of Mamta from the front of the queue.  Step 2: Calculate the number of people between Amrita and Mukul. This can be calculated by subtracting the position of Amrita and Mukul from the total number of people in the queue. So, the number of people between Amrita and Mukul = 50 - 10(Amrita's position) - 25(Mukul's position) = 15.  Step 3: Since Mamta is in the middle of these 15 people, her position will be half of this number from Amrita's position. So, Mamta's position from Amrita is 15/2 = 7.5. Since positions in the queue are in whole numbers, we round up to the nearest whole number which is 8.  Step 4: To find the position of Mamta from the front, we add her position relative to Amrita to Amrita's position. So, Mamta's position from the front = 10(Amrita's position) + 8(Mamta's position from Amrita) = 18.

Thus, during the summer months when temperatures are higher, the metal wires heat up and expand. When the wires expand, they become longer.

This is why telephone wires sag more in summer.\\n\\nTherefore, both the assertion and the reason are true, and the reason correctly explains why the assertion is true.

Arguments: I. Yes. Our government employees are having maximum number of holidays among the other countries of the world. II. Yes.

Argument I is stating that the number of holidays should be reduced because our government employees have the maximum number of holidays compared to other countries. This argument isn't strong because it's not necessary to base our decisions solely on what other countries are doing. Different countries may have different customs, work cultures, and legal requirements regarding holidays, and these factors can greatly influence the number of holidays. Therefore, the number of holidays in other countries should not be the sole criterion for deciding the number of holidays in our country. Thus, argument I is not strong.\\n\\nNow, let's consider argument II. This argument states that reducing the number of holidays will increase the productivity of government offices. This argument is strong because it is generally accepted that more working hours can lead to increased productivity, provided that employees are not overworked to the point of exhaustion or burnout. Therefore, if reducing the number of holidays does not negatively impact employee morale or well-being, it could indeed lead to increased productivity. Thus, argument II is strong.\\n\\nIn conclusion, only argument II is strong, so the answer is (b).\nTherefore answer is Clearly, a comparison with the system in other countries is no strong a criterion for taking a decision on the issue.

Argument I states that foreign films should be banned because they depict an alien culture which could adversely affect Indian values. This is a subjective argument, as the perception of 'alien culture' and its impact on our values can vary from person to person. Furthermore, exposure to different cultures can also be seen as a positive aspect, as it promotes learning and understanding of diversity. Therefore, this argument is not strong enough to support a ban on foreign films.  Argument II argues against the ban, stating that foreign films are of a high artistic standard. This argument is also not strong enough to contradict the ban, as the artistic standard of a film does not necessarily dictate whether it should be allowed or banned. The quality of a film is subjective and can vary greatly, and therefore cannot be used as a definitive argument against a ban.  Therefore, neither argument I nor argument II is strong enough to definitively answer the question, and the answer is (d) neither I nor II is strong.\nTherefore answer is Clearly foreign films depict the alien culture but this only helps in learning more.

Therefore, Argument I is not strong.\\n\\nArgument II: The second argument states that reservations should not be made on a communal basis as ours is a secular state. This argument is strong because in a secular state, no religious or communal group should be given preference over others.

The best supported statement is choice (e) that manufacturers must depend upon final consumers for the success of their undertakings. This is because the paragraph points out that manufacturers distribute goods in advance of their final selection by consumers, indicating that consumer choices ultimately determine the success of the manufacturer's undertakings. Choice (a) is incorrect because the passage states that manufacturers distribute goods in advance of their final selection by consumers, not directly to them. Choice (b) is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that advertising can eliminate the risk of overproduction. Choice (c) is incorrect because the passage describes the risks that manufacturers take as 'enormous', not 'moderate'. Choice (d) is incorrect because the passage states that predicting consumer behavior is a risk, not something that can be done with great accuracy.\"\nTherefore answer is According to the passage, it is very difficult for the manufacturer to predict the consumers' response to his products. But by advertising, he can stimulate the consumers to buy his product. So, the theme of the paragraph is best mentioned in (b). Hence. (b) is the answer. (a) is incorrect because it is mentioned in the paragraph that manufacturers distribute goods in advance of their demands and not directly to the consumers. (c) is wrong because according to the passage, manufacturers take 'enormous' and not 'moderate' risks.
