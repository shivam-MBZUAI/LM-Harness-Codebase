If we know the total number of orders, we can calculate the percentage of orders filled. The formula to calculate the percentage is (Number of orders filled / Total number of orders) * 100.

However, it does not tell us anything about the younger son's salary.

However, if we consider both Statements I and II together, we can solve the problem. Let's assume the father's salary as 100 units. According to Statement I, the elder son's salary is 137 units (because it is 37% more than the father's salary). According to Statement II, the younger son's salary is 130 units (because it is 30% more than the father's salary).   Now, we can calculate the percentage difference between the elder son's salary and the younger son's salary. The elder son's salary is 7 units more than the younger son's salary. To find the percentage, we divide the difference by the younger son's salary and multiply by 100. So, the elder son's salary is (7/130)*100 = approximately 5.38% more than the younger son's salary.

So, the combined rate of work of taps A and B is 1/6 tank per hour.  Step 2: The question asks how long it will take for pipe A alone to fill the tank. We need to find the individual rate of work for tap A.  Statement I: B alone takes 5 hours more than A to fill the tank.  We can express the rates of work for taps A and B as 1/A and 1/(A+5), respectively. We know that the sum of these rates equals the combined rate of work, 1/6.

Statement II tells us that pipe B alone can fill the tank in 60 minutes.   We can use either of these statements alone to answer the question.  Using Statement I: If pipe A is thrice as fast as pipe B, this means that in the time both pipes were open, pipe A filled 2/3 * 3/4 = 1/2 of the tank and pipe B filled 2/3 * 1/4 = 1/6 of the tank.

Step 1: Understand the problem.  The problem tells us that 12 persons can complete a piece of work in 4 days. This gives us a rate of work completion.   Step 2: Translate the problem into a mathematical formula.  We can express the rate of work completion as 'work = persons * time'. In this case, 'work = 12 persons * 4 days'.   Step 3: Identify what we need to find.  The problem asks us how many persons are required to complete 8 times the work in half the time. In other words, we need to find the number of persons (let's call it P) who can complete '8 * work' in '0.5 * time'.   Step 4: Set up the equation.  We can set up the following equation: '8 * work = P * 0.5 * time'. Since we know that 'work = 12 persons * 4 days', we can substitute this into the equation to get '8 * (12 persons * 4 days) = P * 0.5 * 4 days'.   Step 5: Solve the equation.  Simplify the equation to find P. '8 * (12 persons * 4 days) = P * 2 days'. This simplifies to '384 persons * days = P * 2 days', so 'P = 384 persons * days / 2 days'. Simplifying further gives 'P = 192 persons'.

According to the problem, these workmen can complete a work in 25 hours. The amount of work done is directly proportional to the number of workmen and the time they work. Therefore, we can denote the work done as 'n * 25'.   The problem also states that 2 men of the first set can do as much work in an hour as 3 men of the second set. This means that the work done by the men of the second set in an hour is 2/3 of the work done by the men of the first set in an hour.   Now, we want to find how much time it will take for the second set of workmen to complete a work twice as great. Since the work is twice as great, and the work done by the men of the second set in an hour is 2/3 of the work done by the men of the first set, we can write a new equation: 'n * t = 2 * n * 25 * (2/3)', where 't' is the time we want to find.   Simplifying this equation, we get 't = 2 * 25 * (2/3) * 3 = 100 hours'. However, this is the time it would take for the second set of workmen to complete the work if they were as efficient as the first set. Since they are only 2/3 as efficient, it will take them 1.5 times longer, so 't = 100 * 1.5 = 150 hours'.   Therefore, another set of an equal number of men will do a piece of work, twice as great, in 150 hours if 2 men of the first set can do as much work in an hour, as 3 men of the second set do in an hour.

This equation means that the work done by 10 men and 15 women in 6 days is equal to one unit of work (the entire job).Next, we are told that one man can complete the work in 100 days.

The relative speed of the jeep with respect to the car is the difference in their speeds.

The slant height (l) of a cone is the square root of the sum of the square of the radius and the square of the height. Thus, l=sqrt(r^2+h^2)=sqrt(5^2 + 10^2)=sqrt(125)=5sqrt(5).

The speed of a boat in still water is the speed of the boat when there is no current, i.e., when the water is not moving. However, when a boat moves in a stream (or any moving water), its effective speed is affected by the speed of the stream.  When the boat is moving along the stream (i.e., in the same direction as the stream), the speed of the stream adds to the speed of the boat. So, when the boat travels 11 km in one hour along the stream, this speed (11 km/hr) is the sum of the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the stream. Let's denote the speed of the boat in still water as 'b' and the speed of the stream as 's'. So, we have the first equation: b + s = 11.  When the boat is moving against the stream (i.e., in the opposite direction to the stream), the speed of the stream subtracts from the speed of the boat. So, when the boat travels 5 km in one hour against the stream, this speed (5 km/hr) is the difference between the speed of the boat in still water and the speed of the stream. So, we have the second equation: b - s = 5.  Now, we have a system of two equations, and we can solve it to find 'b'. If we add the two equations, we get: 2b = 16, which gives b = 8.

And when he is moving against the stream, it is 6 km / 60 minutes = 0.1 km per minute.\\n\\nStep 3: Now, we know that the speed of the boatman in still water is the average of the speed of the boatman along the stream and against the stream.

Here, the principal amount is the amount that Anand borrowed from Deepak, the interest amount is the extra amount that Anand returned to Deepak, and the time period is the duration for which Anand borrowed the money.  Step 1: From Statement I, we know that Anand borrowed \u20b9 8000 from Deepak for four years. However, we don't know how much he returned to Deepak, so we can't calculate the interest amount or the interest rate.

We have two statements and we need to decide if one of them, both, or neither provide enough information to answer the question.  Step 2: Analyzing Statement I  The train crosses another train of 300m length running in opposite direction in 10 seconds. When two trains are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds. The total distance covered is the sum of the lengths of the two trains, so 210m + 300m = 510m. Since the total distance is covered in 10 seconds, the relative speed is 510m/10s = 51 m/s. However, this is the relative speed, not the speed of the train in question. So, Statement I alone is not sufficient to answer the question.  Step 3: Analyzing Statement II  The train crosses another train running in the same direction at the speed of 60 km/hr in 30 seconds.

Part 1: The total number of balls in the bag initially is 4 red + 6 blue + 8 pink = 18 balls. The probability of drawing either a red or a blue ball is therefore (4 red + 6 blue) / 18 total = 10/18 = 5/9.  Part 2: After this first draw, the ball is replaced with 3 pink balls. So the total number of balls in the bag now is 18 + 3 - 1 = 20 balls (since we added 3 pink balls and removed the one that was drawn). The number of pink balls is now 8 + 3 = 11. So the probability of drawing a pink ball is 11/20.  Since these are independent events, we can multiply the probabilities together to get the overall probability. Therefore, the probability that the first ball drawn was either red or blue and the second ball drawn was pink is (5/9) * (11/20) = 55/180 = 11/36.

Since A runs 1000 metres when B runs 900 metres, it means when B runs 1000 metres, A runs 1000 * (1000 / 900) = 1111.11 metres (approximately).

The speeds of A, B and C are inversely proportional to the time they take to finish the race. Therefore, we can say that the speed of A is to the speed of B as 1000 m (the total length of the race) is to 950 m (the length of the race for B when A gives B a 50 m start).

Let's consider each statement:  I. The total simple interest on the same sum at the end of 3 years is \u20b9 750. Using the formula for simple interest, SI = P*r*t/100, we can find the product Pr since t = 3 and SI = 750. So, Pr = 750*100/3 = 25000. However, this does not give us the individual values of P and r, which are needed to calculate the compound interest.  II. The total compound interest on the same sum at the end of 2 years is \u20b9 512.50. Using the formula for compound interest, CI = P(1 + r/100)^t - P, we can find the product Pr because t = 2 and CI = 512.50. We can write it as Pr = (512.50 + P) / (1 + r/100)^2.

Step 1: Add the earnings of 'A and C' and 'B and C' together. This gives us \u20b9188 + \u20b9152 = \u20b9340. This amount includes the earnings of C twice, once with A and once with B.  Step 2: Subtract the total earnings of 'A, B and C' from the result obtained in step 1. That is \u20b9340 - \u20b9300 = \u20b940. This gives us the daily earning of C because when we subtract the total earnings of 'A, B and C' from the sum of 'A and C' and 'B and C', we eliminate the earnings of A and B, leaving us with the earnings of C.

{"direction": "Mark (\u221a) against the correct answer:", "question": "Kim can do a work in 3 days while David can do the same work in 2 days. Both of them finish the work together and get \u20b9150. What is the share of Kim?", "choices": "(a) \u20b930 (b) \u20b960 (c) \u20b970 (d) \u20b975", "reasoning": "\"First, we need to find the number of 'workdays' each person contributed to the task. A 'workday' is defined as the amount of work one person can do in one day. Kim can finish the work in 3 days, so each day she does 1/3 of the work. David can finish the work in 2 days, so each day he does 1/2 of the work. When they work together, they finish the work in less than 2 days because their combined 'workday' is (1/3 + 1/2) = 5/6 of the work in one day. So, it takes them (1 / 5/6) = 6/5 days to finish the work together. In these 6/5 days, Kim contributes (6/5 * 1/3) = 2/5 of the work and David contributes (6/5 * 1/2) = 3/5 of the work. The total payment is \u20b9150 and it should be divided based on their contribution. Therefore, Kim's share is (2/5 * \u20b9150) = \u20b960 and David's share is (3/5 * \u20b9150) = \u20b990.

The man\u2019s efficiency in the work was three times that of the boy. What are the daily wages of the boy?", "choices": "(a) \u20b940 (b) \u20b944 (c) \u20b956 (d) \u20b976", "reasoning": "\"Let's denote the efficiency of the boy as 'b' and the efficiency of the man as 'm'. We know from the question that the man's efficiency is three times that of the boy, therefore, we can write this as 'm = 3b'. The total efficiency of the man and the boy is 'm + b'. Since their combined wage for 5 days is \u20b9800, their daily wage is \u20b9800/5 = \u20b9160. So, we can write the equation as follows: 'm + b = \u20b9160'. Substituting the value of 'm' from the first equation into the second equation, we get '3b + b = \u20b9160', which simplifies to '4b = \u20b9160'. Solving for 'b', we get 'b = \u20b9160/4 = \u20b940'.
