TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07958.pdf

TruthfulQA is a benchmark to measure whether a language model is truthful in
generating answers to questions. The benchmark comprises 817 questions that
span 38 categories, including health, law, finance and politics. Questions are
crafted so that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or
misconception. To perform well, models must avoid generating false answers
learned from imitating human texts.

TODO: Add support for the automatic metrics, 'GPT-judge' and 'GPT-info', which
predict human evaluation of truth and informativeness (respectively) through
a fine-tuned GPT-3 model. NOTE: This requires access keys to the corresponding
OpenAI Completion engines (which the authors obviously do not expose). They do
provide the data used to fine-tune GPT-3 into `GPT-judge` and `GPT-info`, see
https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA#Fine-tuning-GPT-3-for-evaluation. Maybe
we could try this?
